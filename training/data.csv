my girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up hello  i dont really know how to start this  i guess ill tell you how i met my ex   roughly   years ago  i was a patient in a psychiatric hospital  as a side note  ive struggled with depression for most of my life  and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years  while i was in the hospital  i met this girl  we talked a few times  and she told me that she was being treated for depression also  though she didnt seem very depressed at first  she told me stories about her  previous life  as a med student  and how she failed out of med school  i found myself drawn to her charms  not much later  she left the facility because the treatment wasnt working for her  i gave her my number  and she texted me that same day  for   weeks  we would text all day  talking about everything  mostly how bored we were  she with her life at her apartment all alone  and i with the therapies  we realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date  then another  and another  i was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that i had been going through  we were a couple before we even knew it   things were still difficult for both of us  but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship  i got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job  she was supposedly doing the same thing  she came over often  to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me  she met my son  things started getting more and more clear to me though  she slept a lot  and i mean a lot  up to    hours a day  she was bored all the time  thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety  there were days when shed lay in bed all day  get up to do something  and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed  i wont say that it wasnt somewhat tough on me too to see her like that  but i always hoped for it to get better  shed have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us  or make   paintings  or talk about going back to school  but it was the minority of her days  i loved her though  and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny  and she got along great with my son   after a year or so  i decided that i needed to start looking for a job  i found it so quickly that i was kind of stunned by it  but happy  of course  she was really happy for me too  i enjoyed my job at first  but found it pretty stressful  even from the beginning  months passed  and the stress started building up  i started drinking again  small amounts  at first  i tried to hide it from my girlfriend  but she caught on pretty quickly  she tried helping me  i wouldnt let her  the drinking got worse  id come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me  and wed argue  which i usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk i was  she told me that i shouted at her  insulted her  made her cry  id be so ashamed  ask her to forgive me  to please please please give me another chance  promised that i would stop drinking  and i would  for a while  then it would all repeat itself again   one night i came home late again and we did the same old routine  the next morning  i found her in the garage with her bags packed  said i had said all kinds of nasty things to her  as i had so many times before  but this time was different  she told me that i had said i didnt give a fuck about her  that i wanted her to leave  and when she started sobbing  i shouted at her to sob less loudly because i couldnt hear my music  i couldnt believe it  i just couldnt  at first i thought she was bluffing about leaving  but when she started silently crying i knew i had fucked up  i told her  of course i dont want you to leave  and then i begged her to stay  her mom eventually arrived and took her away   i tried calling her so many times  on her cell and even her parents landline  i got her mom on the phone once  and she confirmed that she was there  but she didnt want to talk to me    one week later  i got a call from her sister  she hanged herself  she apparently left a note  saying how lonely she was  and how i had been her only friend  how terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didnt care  how it had been the last straw   i feel sick even writing this  i killed her  i killed the woman i loved  ive been sober for   months now  but its not enough  its never going to be enough  i feel so guilty  i miss her so much  lately ive been feeling suicidal again myself  all i want is to be with her again  if i could only tell her how sorry i am  but i cant   thanks for reading to the end  ,1

raped in front of my girlfriend  feeling like giving up     i dont know what to say or do  i just feel like my life is falling apart   three weeks ago my apartment was broken into by   strangers  my girlfriend was sleeping over  it was an awful  horrific long night  and she witnessed every single thing    hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse   these   strangers destroyed me  they shredded every bit of self esteem and sanity i had  after the hell they put me through  they simply left me there  bleeding heavily and stunned  my girlfriend was tied up screaming  but i didnt move  it took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up   weeks later  i am paranoid  unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust  and i spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life  i didnt tell a single soul about this because i feel so ashamed  i feel pathetic and weak  my girlfriend is the only one that knows  though everyone around has been telling me ive been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it  yet i dont care  i just feel numb  i want to die  but im too afraid to say it out loud  that night they not only violently violated me  but they took something from me  a piece of my soul   anyways  ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different  she treats me differently  touches me differently  and most importantly she looks at me differently  a few days ago while we were sitting together  she told me that its alright if this experience turns me  gay  and that we dont have to continue dating  this is coming from a    year old girl that has common sense  it all just made me feel really bad  it just reflected how after all this  how disgusting i feel was valid  that i am gross in her eyes now   today is my birthday  i turn     i bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone  im sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in  i just feel alone in a way i never felt before  i just never thought this is where id be  that this would be my life   i hope im posting this in the correct place  ive only had reddit when i was younger  thanks for listening for whoever is out there  hopefully ill feel better for writing this   update    two of the assailants were caught by the police today  i ll post a more detailed update in the next few days   thank you everyone for this support   update    sorry i m late with this  i ve just been going through a lot  i m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that s went down   the four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money  i m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect  but i hope this general explanation is enough   two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial   i m currently trying to get myself together  but things have been getting worse and worse mentally  i ve been going to gym  jogging and trying my best to not lose it  i didn t start therapy  but i m considering it    me and my girlfriend broke up and there s no bad blood  i just need to focus on myself    and again  thank you everyone for the immense support you ve given me  you have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone  thank you  ,1

not a single person actually cares unless you kill yourself if you say youre so depressed you cant function its  aw itll get better  and they forget about you  then when you kill yourself everyones like  oh i never wouldve thought  i wish he wouldve given some sort of sign     i said how many times i want to kill myself and i think i might do it  but i know if i do people will act like its a huge surprise    ive been serious all along  i have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room  so that its always ready  im not joking or just looking for attention when i tell people i need some kind of help  everybody only pretends to care and then when youre dead tries to say they cared all along ,1

i am never  suicidal enough  to be heard  i am too well dressed  too articulate  too friendly  too  everything to be worthy of any support  and i am gradually withering away because of it   mental health professionals never take me seriously  i can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes  their disengaged body language  their patronising tone of voice  they say im  too  well dressed   too  articulate   too  intelligent  i am  too  kind  i smile  too  often  im  too  calm   this has not only been offensive to me  but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal  their implication that suicidal people are dumb  frenzied and rude slobs was   and still is   fucking preposterous   i have tried to get help for approximately   years  i have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears  but unless im trying to end my life right now in front of them  it doesnt matter  none of it matters  i dont matter    my public face is  too  convincing  but this was carefully created and crafted  over many years  because i had no choice  i had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain i have suffered behind a smile  i was never given an alternative  and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade  they did nothing   the truth is  a part of me is frightened of dying  and my survival instincts kick in when i dont want them to  but that doesnt mean i want to live  either  if i could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it  i would    why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care  why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to  why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out  i hate this  i hate my life  i hate myself  let me be what they want me to be  please     edit    i never ever  ever  consider others as  dumb  frenzied  rude slobs  by the way  im so sorry if i made anyone feel that way  its simply how i interpret the reaction of mental health professionals  when they say  but youre so clever hygienic pretty well groomed  etc  it feels like a slap in the face  as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented  and looked down on if they are not  too  but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view   if someone is unkempt  hasnt showered  is visibly distressed or less coherent  i do not judge them or advocate doing so   but using someones appearance as a way of invalidating their pain  thats   completely   wrong       edit      thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject  it means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people  it also brings me comfort  i am sorry for not responding to everyone yet  if you have had a similarly invalidating experience  i am so sorry  i appreciate the difficulty internalising this  but it is  not  your fault  you are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional  who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments    in positive developments  the crisis team visited me at home this evening  both mental health nurses listened to me  emphasised that the way i was treated for the last   years was unacceptable  completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy  it has restored a little bit of faith in the nhs  they are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that i be allocated a care co ordinator  who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections  i have not allowed myself to anticipate too much  but i cried with relief after they left  i hope they keep their word  i hope they meant it  i desperately just hope  until i receive an outcome  i will sincerely try to stay alive  i am not in a position to promise that i will survive  but i can promise that i will try  one more time  ,1
is anyone else entering the new year wishing they were dead   ,1
i hate how people dismiss us when we openly say that we are suicidal but when someone keep quiet and kill them selves people be shocked like  they never said anything i didn t know  wake tf up and love me stop dismissing how i feel my parents kicked me out for being suicidal  now a family friend killed himself and they are all suffering not knowing why because he was relatively  happy  and had a good life    meanwhile my mother while i was panicking she handed me a knife  ,1
i receive two messages a day  one that my phone is at      and the other that my phone is at     edit  thank you for the kind words everyone  each and every one of you brightened my day a bit  also gold hypers  ,1
new wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide  and how to spot covert incitement weve been seeing a worrying increase in pro suicide content showing up here and  and also going unreported  this undermines our purpose here  so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide     weve created a wiki that covers these issues   we hope this will be helpful to anyone whos wondering whether somethings okay here and which responses to report   it explains in detail why  any  validation of suicidal intent  even an  innocent  message like  if youre      committed  ill just wish you peace  is likely to increase peoples pain  and why its important to report even subtle pro suicide comments  the full text of the wikis current version is below  and it is maintained at   r suicidewatch wiki incitement  http   www reddit com r suicidewatch wiki incitement     we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive  empathetic  non judgemental support to our ops  and we particularly thank everyone whos already been reporting incitement in all forms     please report any post or comment that encourages suicide  or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar  to the moderators  either by clicking the  report  button or by  sending us a modmail  https   www reddit com message compose to   fr  fsuicidewatch  with a link  we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can  but we cant read everything so community reports are essential  if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines  please report it both  to the reddit sitewide admins  http   www reddit com report  and to us in modmail    thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us                           r suicidewatch wiki incitement  http   www reddit com r suicidewatch wiki incitement                   summary       its important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions  its never necessary  helpful  or kind to support suicidal intent  there are some common misconceptions  discussed below  about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide  there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose  often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful         validate feelings and experiences  not self destructive intentions     were here to offer support  not judgement   that means accepting  with the best understanding we can offer  whatever emotions people express   suicidal people are suffering  and were here to try to ease that by providing support and caring   the most reliable way we know to de escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood  that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are  or telling them what to do or not do     but theres an important line to draw here   theres a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non judgmentally to suicidal thoughts  and in any way endorsing  encouraging  or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs    anything that condones suicide  even passively   encourages  suicide  it isnt supportive and does not help  it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines  explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions    do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and cant change their minds or be helped  anyone whos able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living  even if theyve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide  made a suicide plan  or started carrying it out     in  the most useful empirical model we have  https   www apa org science about psa         sci brief   the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors  alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer  these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world      so  any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent  even something  innocent  like  i hope you find peace   is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that theyre unwelcome in the world  it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded          how to avoid validating suicidal intent     keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide         people who say they dont want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesnt invalidate their emotions    unfortunately   many popular  good  responses are actually counterproductive  https   www speakingofsuicide com            what not to say    in particular  many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that  its not so bad   and this is usually experienced as  i dont understand what youre going through and im not going to try    people whove had  help  that made them feel worse dont want any more of the same   it doesnt mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive cant give them any comfort           most people who are suicidal want to end their      pain       not their lives     its almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering  of course there are exceptional situations  and we certainly acknowledge that  for some people  the right help can be difficult to find  but preventing someones suicide doesnt mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding         an unfixable problem doesnt mean that a good life will never be possible      we dont have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better  its important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed   for every kind of difficult life situation  you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair  and others who cope amazingly well  and a whole spectrum in between  a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time  this can depend on many personal and situational factors  but when theres not enough  interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it   we go into more depth on the  it gets better  issue in  this psa post  https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments   igd  whats wrong with it gets better what if it doesnt   which is always linked from our sidebar  community info on mobile  guidelines        there are      always      more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives     to avoid accidentally breaking the anti incitement rule  dont say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea  or that someone cant turn back or is already dead   do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome  at least in this little corner of the world    our talking tips  http   redd it igh    offer more detailed guidance      look out for deliberate incitement   it may come in disguise      often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs   unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon  https   en wikipedia org wiki william francis melchert dinkel    people like this  are  out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them     they will typically try to scratch their psychological  itch  by saying things that push people closer to the edge   they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above   specifically you might see people doing the following     encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying     there are      always      more and better choices than  brutally forcing someone to stay alive  or helping  actively or passively  them to end their lives       creating an artificial and toxic sense of  solidarity  by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy   they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person  while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self loathing emotions and self destructive impulses     since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding  this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation       many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help   a couple of key points to keep in mind        skilled suicide intervention    peer or professional    is based on empathic responsiveness to the persons feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment     contrary to pop culture myths  it does   not   involve persuasion   dont do it     cheerleading   youve got this    or meaningless false promises   trust me  it gets better     or invalidation   let me show you how things arent as bad as you think      anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses  or any other response that prolongs their pain  from expert help may be covertly pro suicide   of course  people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental health treatment  and its fine to vent about those  but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help        choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someones trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible     any kind of involuntary intervention is an   extremely unlikely   outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline   confidentiality is addressed in more detail in  our hotlines faq post  http   redd it  c ntr    the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent  we know that no individual or system is perfect   mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people  and we have enormous sympathy for them  but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need

does anyone else have this really destructive pattern of feeling suicidal and ruining everything in your life because you think you won t be around to deal with it  only to fail or not even attempt suicide and have to try to pick up the pieces   ,1
anyone else just staying alive for other people at this point  i shouldn t be so miserable  i have a roof over my head and a family that loves me  i have money and can afford luxuries  i go to therapy and take medicine  i have three pets  one a puppy we recently adopted     but i just want to die  i m so lonely  constantly  my heart is so broken and i m so exhausted i just want to give up and finally kill myself  but i don t want to hurt my family  i don t want to think about my dogs waiting for me to come back and not knowing where i ve gone  i don t want my mum and dad to blame themselves for it    there are some people who d be glad to see me go  my older sister   youngest sister  most likely  my former friends  idk    all i do is disappoint others  i lose them  i can t do anything  i m so useless i can t even kill myself  haha  i m tired  ,1
it s extremely messed up that you can t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi thousand dollar hospital bill  i was in a psych ward once when i was     i struggle with suicidal ideation daily  i would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it  my bill at my psych hospital was about          all because i wanted to jump off a bridge  you can t tell anyone that you re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital  but you can t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner  just making your problems even worse  there s no good solution  i want to have the right to die  or at least get free help  the suicidal hotline doesn t do shit  i want real help  and not to be thrown in a hospital  this system is horrible  we are all victims of it  it s time for a mental health industry overhaul  ,1
being suicidal throughout your young adult years is very strange and leaves you in a weird place when you hit your   s because you never really had a plan to get this far to begin with  never mind have a plan for the next     years   ,1
i think a little kid saved my life  and he doesnt even know  i get depressed  then thought of suicide come into my mind  i think up ways to do it  then i would dream about the aftermath   during the pandemic it has been hard  i live alone  i dont have many friends  im    years old  lost my business and really feel that i have zero to no marketable skills to offer an employer  im fat  out of shape  and a long list of health issues  physical and mental     the other day  i was out on my balcony  twelfth floor  thinking how easy it would be to jump  this is not the first time i have been out there like this  just when i had the courage to climb on the rail  i looked down and saw a little child making chalk drawings on the sidewalk  then my mind wandered and thought about how he would never be able to enjoy playing in front of his home because of what i was going to do  him and his mom live in a ground floor unit  so i would basically be landing on their front walk   i think i will buy him a new set of colouring chalks   edit  i could not believe the responses  i thank you all for the kind words i am feeling overwhelmed  how do i turn off the comments ,1
watch out for a pm scammer asking people to purchase items from an amazon wishlist  hey everyone  just a heads up that were receiving a flurry of reports about this in our modmail   it doesnt get much lower than trying to suck money out of a community like ours with a sob story      we thank all the good citizens whove let us know  and we have reached out to the admins about this person   but please be aware that we as community moderators cant see or police pms   it will help a lot if everyone who received a pm of this nature reports it directly to the admins  either by using the report function within the pm itself  or by using  reddit com report  https   www reddit com report      also  just in case it doesnt go without saying  do not spend any money for this individual   the last thing wed want is for them to get the idea that sw is good victim hunting territory    ,1
chocolate saved my life my last serious suicide attempt was in july       i had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for a conference and randomly packed up so it wouldnt be suspicious to my mom  i didnt want to do it in my room because in a way i didnt want to defile it  i dont know how to explain it   my plan was to do it as soon as i got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and i wanted to make sure nothing would stop me   i opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when i opened the suitcase  something dropped on the floor  it was my favorite chocolate      dark cocoa with candied orange bits  it had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper  my heart dropped and i couldnt stop crying  eventually i think i fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when i woke up  i felt something i hadnt felt in years  i felt loved  my mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes ill forget to eat when im overworked   just wanted to share that with you because i could really use that chocolate today  i really could  ,1
i ve decided that i won t kill my self  ,1
i just saw a post asking  if you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed    i can t think of a single thing  when i saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly  i have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck  even if i think of the year before that  although i have been suicidal in the past with many attempts  that was so long ago and i didn t realize i still felt this way deep down    this last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week i go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin  i guess i haven t felt like dying because i ve been so focused on being high  my mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than   minutes because she can t trust me to not go downtown and pick up   i considered finally dating my best friend of   years as a thing i would have missed happening  but if i m honest  things don t feel the same as they did when we were best friends  i do love him  but now after years of him being clean he s relapsed  it s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital  he s one of the   people in my life that i actually talk to  the other   are my family members   my dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out  it s the first year ever that he has not gifted me something for christmas or my birthday  which are only a week apart  and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn t matter  i know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who  the same as my dad  i can t seem to get myself to call back or message  i have no friends  i am alone and broke and unhappy   this all came out of nowhere  i don t know what to do  i have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and i ve already called and gone there begging over    times in the last   months  there is too many things wrong and i can t solve them all  every time i told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish  so family is off the list of people i can talk to since they tell my mom everything  my boyfriend interrupts me when i tell him i m depressed and goes on about his own feelings  so he s off the list too   my mother won t let me leave the house alone at all either  so i can t get away from her unless i want to leave for good  if i do leave  she will kick me out and not let me back inside  which would force me to stay god knows where  i know that is illegal since i pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears i will run downtown and pick up heroin    unfortunately  all that is on my mind is getting high  if i do  i ve got no home unless i go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that i can think of  even if there was  i can t commit  ironically  drugs are probably the main reason i m not dead yet and why i ve been so distracted from realizing i was still suicidal              i m feeling a million emotions a minute and i have nothing to stop me from making the  wrong  choice  i m sorry this story is so long  i just want to be as detailed as i can so if i do end it  i ve left at least something behind  everything else is dirty and messy and worthless  i feel that i deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred i ve had to deal with in my life  i refuse to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore    i m so  so tired   edit  some words  ,1

does anyone else constantly teeter between planning how to kill yourself and planning how to fix your life   ,1

you ever just leave an awkward conversation and think  wow  i should really just kill myself    that s how all my relationships go  it s no wonder nobody wants to be around me voluntarily  sure  i can make people laugh but that s where my conversational ability ends  i don t leave conversations feeling like i made a new friend or that i matter to people  ,1
i wanted to jump off a bridge  but i got a burrito instead  i bought a second one and gave it to a homeless guy hanging outside the restaurant  it made me feel a bit better for the rest of the night  ,1
people who say  it s a bad day  not a bad life  are the fucking worst it is a bad life  do you rly think i wanna kill myself bc i had one bad day  fuck no  it s because every single day of my life is a battle  every step  every blink  every breath takes so much willpower    depression can t even be cured  people say it s  not logical  to kill your self  but it really is for me at least  it wont get better  depression can only be suppressed  i ll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life  and the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they ll never go away  no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn t even know what i ve been through says    so don t say any of those shallow ass phrases  if ur gonna say those then get out of here bc ur just making things worse  ,1
i m an attractive white man from a wealthy family  the odds were always in my favor  i think i m gonna shoot myself in the face  i don t expect you to read this  just need somewhere to vent    here i am again  sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater  trying to find a reason to keep going  it doesn t help that it s christmas eve  i m basically a    year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past   years  i remember bill burr said at like   yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays  i envy that  at    i went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother  even picked a college she hated   it would embarrass  her     speaking of college  i m still unsure whether i was molested  it s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed  the not knowing really pisses me the fuck off   to this day my mom doesn t think she s done any wrong  after i dropped out i went back home for a little bit  i don t know what i expected  a year or two later i move across the country again to get away  now i am truly and utterly alone  i m currently on my   nd or   rd dead end job  honestly can t believe i ve lasted so long at this one  i guess i look up to the store manager a lot and don t want to let him down  i ve seen a hundred therapists  been on a million different meds  went to rehab for   months  and i feel worse now than i ever have  depression  anxiety  paranoia  they re all too minor to describe what i feel  had my first suicidal thought at  yrs old  at that same age i realized i wanted a girlfriend  it was like there was a hole in my heart  i think i just wanted a female in my life because i hated my mother  but i knew i was too young and figured i d get one later in life   nope  never been in a real relationship  i was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe  we sorta had sex once but i wouldn t even call it that  every girl i ve tried to pursue since either wasn t interested or i didn t try hard enough   didn t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do  doesn t help that i grew up afraid of my mother and hating her    in college i was so desperate to get laid i went on craigslist casual encounters  when that was a thing  but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around  that shattered the little confidence i had  that is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women  i wish i could tell those girls how much damage they ve done  then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain  dating apps don t work it s like my account is invisible  at this point i don t try whatsoever  it s as if i ve been conditioned to not make a move  and the ironic part is i look like a model  genes  muscles  six pack   dress well  and i m actually very smart  the few parties i ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and i would freak out  have a panic attack  and then leave  alcohol didn t help  i m not gay  i m just broken  a beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her  she might even come talk to me first  i ll just shut down  afterward i ll get angry at myself  so i ve stopped going places where i might meet a girl because i know what s going to happen  i ve always found it interesting how much i relate to  ugly  guys who won t pursue a woman because they know what will happen  and those guys take one look at me and hate me  it s like they re thinking  man  if i could just trade places with that guy   hahaha ain t shit would change  man  you d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do   at this point the only reason i haven t shot myself in the face is because of my dog  my cat wouldn t give a shit but i can t do that to my dog  i just can t  the sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality  meaning he s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs  so  maybe it d be for the best if he had a different owner  can t exactly take him to the dog park anymore  and i m sure you can tell how close i am to suicide because i know exactly where to shoot  for your sake i ll spare the details  i don t know why i m writing this i guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge  i just can t be alone anymore  the girl i like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her  and now i feel like maybe she s expecting me to make another move   i don t know  but the way i am  i m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down  you know how hard it was to tell her how i feel  couldn t even do it in person had to send some stupid message  now i have to see her every day  i guess that s why you don t ask out people from work    i have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do not help  nor do the gunshots down the street  i have no one to call  my dad kind of understands what i m going through but there s only so much he can handle  every time i talk to him i feel like he s about to have a heart attack  my brother says i have an illness that just needs to be treated  i feel like he thinks i just want attention  obviously i don t talk to my mom  i actually blocked her  and the suicide hotline     don t get me started  it s like they want you to die  the two real friends i had forgot about me once they found girlfriends  i don t know how much time i have left  and i always thought i was destined for big things  you re all i have left  reddit  you and my dog  shit  the cat probably wants me gone    if you read this far  thank you from the bottom of my heart   edit  thank you everyone  this was more helpful than rehab  and yes i love my cat  he s actually really interesting  basically a real life garfield   edit    i think dave chappelle said it best when he talked about anthony bourdain  that s why i used that title  i can t stand when people think i  have it all   so how can i be so unhappy  anyway thank you again  everyone  and thank you for the platinum  whatever it means  that made my day   edit    i am either delusional or my coworkers read this post  not sure which is worse  but it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato  i hear them talking and i hope it s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they re talking and laughing about what i wrote  why are you laughing you fucks   more gossip to gobble up  one of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me   how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting   i haven t been acting different at work  why would he ask me that  i did have people contact me saying they weren t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r all  so i don t know how many people actually read this  i guess it s possible someone i know came across it  funny that i care when i m so close to ending it all  glad i got it off my chest though  was a huge weight lifted  and the support from you guys was unreal  i didn t respond to everyone but i read every single message and comment  speaking of which  you trolls can go fuck yourselves  it takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit  but it turns out this post helped some people   that s such a foreign feeling for me i didn t believe them  i don t know why i m still writing  i just hate being me  need this life shit to end  ,1

 suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  i hate sayings like this with all my heart  people who say these sort of phrases have no fucking idea what it s like to be in severe pain  they have no clue whatsoever  they re either not educated on cases where people are in severe pain and don t respond to treatment or they just don t believe it  they can t believe life can be that bad that suicide is the only option  and it s because they re basing their views on their own experience  their own feelings and thoughts which aren t the same as people contemplating suicide    if people who say these bullshit phrases could just take a step back and think about things logically  for example  a person posts that they are going to kill themselves  they have suffered in pain for years  they are damaged  they ve tried countless treatments with no response and every day is filled with pain  without the fortune of not being in their shoes  can they not understand why suicide is a viable option  even if you can t feel their pain  surely the facts can speak for themselves  you have to be a fucking idiot to read about a case like that and say to them  suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  or  we have to play the cards we are dealt     do they really think that the suicidal person  after years of pain  is going to think  this quote has changed my perspective entirely  i think i m going to live now    whether the person intends to or not  sayings like this are patronising to people who have spent months or years weighing the options  i m not saying they should just let them die if they ve posted something like that  but patronising and bullshit quotes  when you can t relate  just makes me pissed off    although it s hard and the person just wants to post to let the pain out  they can t without receiving responses that make them feel patronised and stupid  in general i just hate sayings and quotes  they shouldn t be applied to be such a common thing that applies to everyone and every case  there s no right way to respond to someone suicidal  but saying quotes is not the way  best way i can think of is just saying  i m here if you need me for anything  if you want to talk   i m just a big believer in free will  no one should be confined to a life of pain  ,1
 you can talk to me about anything  afterwards they hit you with the  i don t know what to say  line followed by  you should see a therapist   that s how i learned to never to pour my heart out ,1
i just realised that people dont really care about my mental health  they just care that im not a whining bitch anymore  ive learned how to supress my emotions  no more crying  no more screaming at the top of my lungs when im in pain  no more hitting myself when im angry  no more panic attacks in front of others  im still in just as much hurt as i was before  now i just know nobody wants to deal with my bullshit    and you know what  fair  not even i wanna deal with my bullshit  but at least dont act like you do care when you dont  nobody tried to help me solve my problems  they pretended they did  all they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone elses problems and called that me  getting better   despite the fact that i am very visibily just as equally as bad as i was before    i swear this is just even more proof im seriously just a burden  my silence has seemed to drastically improve the lives of those around me  so imagine what literally just not existing could do  ,1
parents who are  there for you  until your mental illness becomes slightly intolerable for them  sorry my depression isn t just crying every other day  sorry that it s also me isolating myself and keeping conversations short  because i want to kill myself  sorry i don t want to be around you guys and be blamed for every small inconvenience or mishap  sorry that my depression inconveniences you so much and that me wanting to kill myself makes your plans for the day  ruined   ,1
does anybody else dress like a homeless person cause they stopped caring about their appearance   ,1
sleep is great because its like being dead without hurting your family   ,1
ive gone to a hotel at the other end of the country to kill myself im due to head back tomorrow  at least thats what ive told people  ive quit my job because its fucking pointless  none of this matters  life is arbitrary  were thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion  this isnt life  this is servitude and i refuse to play along anymore  im so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay    have you looked at the news lately  everything is falling apart around us  the planet is on fire  people are being rounded up  privacy is non existent and were told repeatedly that we have no value unless weve been commoditized  buy this  buy that  you need this random  useless tatt but we dont  we dont  need  any of it but its still rammed down our throats day in  day out  bombarding us from every fucking direction and im just exhausted    i cant do this for another    years  im done  im checking out and i dont mean from the hotel  im going to have a large gin and tonic while i run a bath  it might relax me amd theres a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming  please dont do this  but i dont want to listen anymore    mum  if by chance you happen to read this  please know that i love you and im truly  truly sorry for putting you through this  for what its worth im so glad that you enjoyed silverstone  i love you  i love you i fucking love you and im sorry  edit  im still here  this has been the most difficult    hours of my life but im still here  i took the train back today and told my mum i needed to speak to her urgently  as soon as i saw her i told her i loved her  i told her why i went to a hotel and then i broke down in tears like an absolute mess  she told me she couldnt stand the thought of burying one of her sons  we hugged and i cried on her for about    minutes  im back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming  i still dont think i can go on  but i think im going to at least try  until it becomes unbearable again anyway  ,1
this quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate  the so called  psychotically depressed  person who tries to kill herself doesn t do so out of quote  hopelessness  or any abstract conviction that life s assets and debits do not square  and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing  the person in whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high rise  make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows  their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view  i e  the fear of falling remains a constant  the variable here is the other terror  the fire s flames  when the flames get close enough  falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors  it s not desiring the fall  it s terror of the flames  and yet nobody down on the sidewalk  looking up and yelling  don t   and  hang on    can understand the jump  not really  you d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling    this quote is from infinite jest by david foster wallace   im honestly starting to feel the flames  and the jump is looking far too comforting  ,1
dont you wish you could just sleep forever and never wake up   ,1
i hate how when you re depressed you just forget everything  you forget to do stuff and you forget the stuff you did  time passes without you realising and instead of doing nothing for ten minutes you did nothing for three hours but you didn t even realise you were actually living   ,1
anyone else here  suicidal but not suicidal   im suicidal  but not  suicidal    know what i mean   in other words  im not  suicidal  suicidal   know what i mean   thats not to say im doing it for attention  though  either   thats a common assumption misconception   my pain is very real  my feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine   basically     i was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who  like me  has decided  not  to kill oneself essentially  to continue living despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts feelings ideations wishes     i will not kill myself   but some days  i really dont want to be alive anymore  ,1
the hardest part of being suicidal the hardest part of being suicidal  at least for me     f   its looking into the eyes of someone who loves you unconditionally and telling them that youre fine when youre having suicidal thoughts    my dad is everything to me  he is the most innocent and caring man i have ever encountered  he has tolerated all my rage attacks  crying episodes  tantrums  and has spoiled and loved me ever since the day i was born  i suffer from bipolar   and have been going through a severe depressive episode which usually happens around the same time every year  this year i know exactly whats happening and i want to try my best to get past these thoughts  if not for me  for my dad  i have not known real pain until i saw his eyes water today when he saw me crying  he knows me and what i go through  that hurts me the most  ,1
suicidal people don t want to die  they just want the pain to stop  i hate this quote  i want to die  no one can tell me about my own feelings because i live through my own personal hell every single day   edit  i d meant that i hate this quote  i am not saying this to any of you all  i am not invalidating your experience or telling you you feel a certain way  ,1
has anyone been suicidal for so long but don t have the courage to end it so you end up isolating yourself from everyone so people forget you eventually  i ve cut off my friends for over a year now  but they weren t really friends  just people i knew in all honesty  i never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety  but now  i have no one and it s mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias  avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one  when you ve given up on life a long time ago  you don t care if you have friends  so i ve been isolating myself until noone remembers me  eventually  i will have the courage to kill myself and when i do  noone will remember if i was even here  ,1
i hate how your brain teases you with random moments of motivation hope joy etc  then plunges you back into feeling like subhuman trash for days or weeks on end i feel like i have nothing worth living for  my music sucks ass  which is the only thing i care about  im very grateful my parents care about me but i feel like this isnt getting better no matter how much ive tried  my therapist appointment is so far away even though its only thursday  ive tried holding on  but for some reason it just gets worse   edit  dumbass spelling error ,1
the logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly  frustratingly complicated i would literally attempt suicide right now if i thought it would work  but i just feel like i would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker  when in reality  i just want to die quietly without any fuss    i hate hearing stuff like    if you fail  its just a parasuicidal gesture   and   there are lots of ways to make sure it works    because sure fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people      do i try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs    do i try to hang myself and risk brain damage     do i jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who dont deserve it    do i kill myself in the bath pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards    do i lie to get a prescription i dont actually need and potentially get someone in trouble    do i gas myself and put others in harms way    if i write a note  would that comfort people  or would it just make them feel like they couldve  done something  and make it worse    should i ghost my friends before i do it to minimise the casualties     is it better for my family friends to find me  or some rando    what place time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted    should i endure the pain and wait until im a bit older to kill myself so that im not seen as some immature  self centred kid and people in my life dont blame themselves    if i survive  do i lie and say it was impulsive  and not like  years in the making    should i delete my sns pages and all the messages that i can before doing it    should i try between semesters in case i fail and need to take a break because ive messed up my health    would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family     should i quit my job beforehand  or do i keep it just in case i survive   there is no doubt in my mind that im going to do it  but i dont want to before i have a proper plan in place  partly to minimise the damage  but mostly because im just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up  i dont even question whether or not this is what i really want anymore  its just a matter or how and when    i wish this self righteous society didnt censor     of helpful information thatll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured  i wish i didnt have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this  i wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f  ck all to do with my personal situation  i wish people would admit that its possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed  i wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when its convenient for them  i wish it wasnt so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what i do with my own freaking life that i never even wanted in the first place  ,1
the reason i love my bed and sleeping so much is because it s the closest to death i can get for now  it s like a free trial  ,1
people try to talk you out of suicide instead of talking you into life thats the pattern every time  someone will try and explain why i shouldnt just kill myself but they never give me any good reasons why living is preferable to me dying   death is a perament solution to a temporary problem  no other solution is permanent  anything could go wrong at any time  suicide is a permanent solution to all my problems and is therefore the best one i have  ,1
my sister committed suicide last night  the pain is so heavy in my heart right now  this whole time i thought i was alone  when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now  she was only     she lives four hours away so we are going to her house now  it s currently     am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry  we have different dads and we don t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter  she was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little  i have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol  we have so many photos together  she always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays  i can t even type right now i m in so much pain  i still can t and don t want to believe this  someone i knew so well gone just like that  ,1
wife cheated update edit  so ive been getting a lot of dms asking how i caught her etc and what i did  so i came back from a late night jog as i find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty  i came back home to have a shower of course as i was sweaty as fuck  i entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where i saw her with another man in bed  my god damn silk sheets tainted by them     but yeah its weird cause i thought i would lash out but i was unusually calm about it  i told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings  like this guy is literally tripping everywhere    i think he was afraid as i was just very calm and he didnt expect it  anyway i spoke to my wife asking how long its been happening and she told me who he is etc  its a childhood  friend   after that i went to the train station which is where the first post came in   edit    people are also asking how long we were together  so i met my loyal and faithful wife at    and we got married at     so in total thats    years of faithfulness from the amazing wife    edit    holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much     edit    people are surprised that im over this so quick and im calm about it  i guess its down to the fact i live by the rule that is  the pains compulsory  sufferings optional   original post  https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments gt   f wife cheated  utm medium android app utm source share  so its been about   hours since i posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments    im not going to lie when i posted the previous post i was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped    ive now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in  i have now burnt  which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but i wouldnt have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much i scrub them    it felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go  ive cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing    her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that i cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and i just sent them the videos         now her family has pretty much disowned her which i feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly i couldnt care less   im free  feeling a bit shit but i know ill be happier and honestly if it wasnt for you guys i probably wouldnt be here    thank you so much everyone  especially the dude that was talking about pasta   ,1
 you re not alone   yes  the fuck i am  it s me vs world  it s always been me vs the world and no matter how many times random ass people post shit on like instagram about how  you re not alone    you re gonna be okay   it will never be true  i am alone and i will make the decision to eat lead alone  i will die and rot alone just as a lived because that s the sad reality for some people  some people have people  some do not and that s just how it is  ,1
im a pedophile and i think im ready to kill myself ive never had a normal sex drive and i thought i was asexual for a while  but i guess the reality is more insidious  ive struggled with pure o ocd ever since i was a child  and at first i thought this was it  ive always worried about hurting people  my sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school  since i have been borderline asexual my whole life  late high school was when it began  although i was never able to accept it then  it hit like a truck last summer where i had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital  i hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish  but they only helped the anxiety and depression  it has been getting steadily worse ever since  most therapists understandably dont want to see me  yesterday i masturbated to an anime child  thankfully i have never looked up illegal images   i think at this point it hit what i had become and i lost hope for redemption  i am a ticking time bomb before i ruin someones life  and i cant live with myself like this  i can never have a so  or a family  even having friends feels wrong  its going to be be hard as i actually enjoy my life quite a bit  but i feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do  end it now while im still me  before this takes over  from now on i plan to stop taking my meds  as the mood swings will help me get this done  then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to avril   th  i am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility  wish me the luck and courage to end this  thank you  edit  still here  going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision i think  thank you for your kindness even if i dont understand it  ,1
nobody talks about the after attempt i tried to kill myself  i overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines  the advice i have  dont  nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life  the people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived  and you get to see it  and you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells  treat you like youre a kicked puppy   and the guilt is worse than that before  because you caused that and they wont admit it to you  the guilt is soul destroying  and then theres you  your stomach cant handle anything but water and plain bread  the sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet  the shaking for no reason  entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment  sleep  no  you will wake up routinely every hour or so  and thats if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place  oh  and when you finally think your body has recovered  its worse  you cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit  like youre peeing out of your ass  water can even make you feel sick    okay sure  you wanna die  but a lot dont succeed  and the failure is grim  i have liver damage  my stomach linings are non existent  im suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage ive done   edit  its been   weeks  i have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid ,1
theyll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is  never the answer    honestly  this is one of the most puzzling things about society  people tell you that  we dont live in a vaccum  everyone has people who care  along with other shamings of suicide calling you  cowardly    but when you want to live   oh no  youre entitled to nothing  if you dont do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box    but remember  dont kill yourself because  people care about you so much   i understand having to work to participate in society but i find it so stupid that people cant see the incongruity  i cant honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold  keep struggling because life is worth it   if they want to die  then let them die and vice versa  ,1
reminder  no activism is allowed here at any time  we know that september    was world suicide prevention day   and  were all for activism    but not here  please and thank you   it takes focus away from our ops in need of support and understanding    ,1
i m more afraid to live another    years than dying  does anyone else feel this way  ,1
if you make enough suicide attempts  people stop caring  that s what i feel has happened to me  it s like i don t have the right to say  i m sad  anymore because i either get ignored or eye rolls    i ve come up with a pretty fool proof way to strangle myself while i am unconscious  and i have decided to have another go at trying to die  this is my fifth attempt  my first i put a gun to head and chickened out  second i stranded myself in the wilderness  third i tried to mix pills  and fourth i basically drank poison    i didn t think it mattered  being supported    maybe it s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one  maybe it s family looking annoyed and just saying  i m sorry you feel like this   maybe it s my marriage partner flat out saying nothing when i tell him i want to die  maybe it s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain  then shoots me up to mania so i feel like i have no control of my life  maybe it s because i m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless  i don t contribute to society  i should be allowed to be euthanized    thanks for listening like usual r suicidewatch  i appreciate it  no one else wants to  though you have my gratitude  i hope i never post here again  because i will finally be successful  ,1
you know somethings wrong when your first reaction towards someone elses suicide is jealousy  not sadness  and its absolutely wrong  i know  but it doesnt make it not true  im a mistake  please someone end my suffering  ,1
my mom showed off my suicide letter like it was a fashion statement so basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago  had everything prepared  was ready to just end it all  until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it off  my mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it   i became  some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that  itll get better  or saying if it was true sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there  couldve saved myself from embarrasment ,1
  billion people  and for some stupid reason i needed to be born too  and you too  if you feel the same way about your existence   ,1
i fucking hate how people tell me to find something that i enjoy  that thing doesnt fucking exist   ,1
i wish it didn t require so much courage to die i wish depression killed naturally  like you just had to sit and wait and it would run its course and kill you eventually  but it doesn t physically kill you  you have to do that part yourself  and i hate that i probably won t ever kill my self because i m too fucking scared    i wish people could realize that the longer they keep me here  the worse i get  not better  i m so fucking empty and i ve tried everything  i need help but no one can give it to me because nothing works  it s just more of the same  i wish people knew i felt like this but i can t show them without scaring them or getting sent to a fucking mental institution as if that ll help  i just wish people at school could see this and maybe they d treat me better  i don t know  i feel so fucking sick and miserable and every day is the same and i m so fucking tired of this every single day i m so fucking miserable im so fucking tired i can t do this anymore please i just want to die ,1
do you ever have a really good dream but then wake up back to reality and tasting that fleeting moment of happiness makes you just want to fucking die so much   ,1
anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great  the real part of yourself  the part that had dreams and ambitions  the part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with  the part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering  sleeping and eating your favourite foods  maybe movies  tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful  the innocent part  now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind  this is not a post of optimism  more just typing what floats in my complex mind   i think we all knew the potential we once had  and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly  some recover  others don t  others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it  some can t end their lives due to the pain  others can more easily   i used to think i wouldn t miss living if i died    but i don t think that s true  i would miss the part of me buried deep within  not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses  but the part of me that was inclusive  kind and dreamy  realism is a terrible thing for people suffering  with no indication of improvement  and the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back  can be a terrible thing too  do not let hope control your life  personally  no matter how comforting hope can be  it has a harmful agenda in the long run  what if the hoping never ends  ,1
we need some support over at r teenagers  today  that sub has seen an unnatural spike in suicide notes  and one of them seems to have actually gone through with it  none of us over there have any way of confidently trying to talk these people out of their actions  so i would greatly appreciate it if some of you kept an eye out for any more suicidal teens that appear and help us in our endeavor to prevent any more deaths  ,1
a letter to a friend wholl never read it  i saw you today    things were good  better than good  you were smiling that idiotic smile that i love  wearing that old and faded track pants that i begged you to throw away but you never did  then you saw me  your face lit up  you came towards me  held my hands and said the silliest  stupidest joke that i ever heard  you know i dont like jokes but you still make me laugh  how do you do that    we were together after such a long time  me nagging you  you making me laugh  falling in love all over again  it was just like old times    i saw you today  but then i woke up   i wanted to hold on to you  to be with you and never let you go again  to go back into the dream where you were  but i couldnt  the harder i tried the farther you felt    realization hit  id never see you again  id never talk to you  nag you  hold you  be held by you  give you the cherry on top of my ice creams because i still dont like them    i hate you   i hate you  i hate you  i hate you   i hate you because you never loved me enough  i hate you because you never trusted me enough  and i hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me   everytime i needed you  you were there  you never complained about the time  you let me cry  shout  rage when i was in pain  you helped me so much  but you never told that you were in pain  why   why didnt you    did you not think that id do everything to comfort you  i may not have been able to take away your pain  but i wouldve held your hand through it    i hate you  and ill always hate you  because i love you  and ill always love you    no one can take your place  you were entirely special  all that sickening positivity and patience  was it all a lie then  a mask  a cover up for your feelings   im sorry i failed you  i shouldve looked deeper  shouldve been a better friend  may be if i didnt rely on you so much  you wouldve been comfortable to rely on me  is that why you couldnt even say goodbye   i hate you and ill always will  and someday im going to die as well  it may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between  im going to die and then im going to find you in the afterlife  and id hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and god knows what else  but ill never let you go then  ill always  always be with you    till then  ill hold you in my heart and dreams and memories   ill always love you  you perv  ,1
does anyone else just feel like disappearing socially  nuking social media  cutting ties to your family   friends  etc  i am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head  its to the point where ive been giving more and more thought to just  disappearing  from peoples lives  not even saying goodbye    just disappearing  obliterating every real connection that i have so i can slip further and further into solitude  maybe i just want to make it easier for when i finally decide to off myself  i dont know    what i do know is that everything feels so    pointless  i cant stop feeling numb and empty    i just want to sever all my ties and connections so i can be alone  so i can self destruct alone   i cant even remember a time where i felt ok  i dont think ill ever feel ok again  and its not ok to feel this way  no one should ever  ever have to feel this way  ever    but yet  some of us do  and it fucking sucks  i wish i could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave  ,1

i m sick and tired of nobody giving a fuck about how you feel unless you re cutting yourself or want to kill yourself  does anybody understand how incredibly selfish that is    don t do it there s so much to live for  like what your sorry ass who doesn t want me gone so that you re not sad  guess fucking what i don t fucking care if you re that selfish you deserve to be just as sad as i am  i ve been suffering all my life and you don t give a fuck but the second i say i m gonna kill myself now it matters  but if i shut up about wanting to die and just express about how hurt i am you have better things to do you don t fucking care nobody fucking cares   don t talk to me about suicide it makes me uncomfortable  oh so sorry need me to paint your nails too princess    and like cutting doesn t even give me any sort of nice relief it doesn t do anything for me  wanna know why i do it  to express how fucking bad i m hurting because nobody gives a shit unless you cut yourself  people can be suffering worse and not cut themselves because it doesn t do anything for them  nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares and i m so sick and tired of it ,1
i told my parents i m going to kill myself and they just wished me the best as i was walking out of the door my mum said she hopes that ll now make me happy    nobody tried to stop me or check if i would be okay   i ve told them i feel suicidal about   times before  and they ve pretty much brushed it off like it s just attention seeking   now idk about you but i think that s pretty fcuked up    of course your child is seeking attention they want to fcuking die because they cannot take life anymore    i m just so sick of everything  i feel like i have no one i can turn to    my ex left me  i have no real friends and now my family have turned their back on me   i just can t take this anymore  ,1
i m absolutely annoyed whenever i comment something suicidal and random people just tell me  call the national suicide prevention hotline    i actually want people that i can relate my problems with  i don t want a fucking hotline that doesn t do shit   ,1
my friend has killed himself there was a guy i met in this sub  a really good guy  i followed many of his posts  and didnt speak to him  till i saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life    its really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope  dreams and joy in life  how it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty   this guy was a legend  he tried his best  but still unable to find strenght to carry on  i believe this is the worst way to go    i wish i said something more  i wish i knew better   now there is nothing anyone can do  he left thinking worst of himself  feeling worthless after many years of struggle    please dont mind if its written poorly  i had to get this off my chest   thanks ,1
no one cares until youre about to kill yourself its funny how no one says anything until youre about to kill yourself  it doesnt matter how much youre suffering  you are a selfish bastard if you kill yourself  you should think of your friends and family and everyone who will miss you  well  these people dont care if im suffering or not as long  as they dont have to notice or think about it    how long am i supposed to keep it all pent up inside  its so fucking tiring  ,1
 it gets better  no it fucking doesn t you cunt i m so sick of people telling me that it gets better  all it does is give me false hope  i ve been waiting for things to get better since i was a kid  it does not get better  it doesn t fucking get better stop saying that bullshit those words are so dangerous because all you do is set yourself the other person up for disappointment  my pain has been never ending  stop saying i m going to get better because i haven t  my mom just came in my room and lectured and shamed me for not doing anything with my life and having no friends  like yeah no shit   it s called having depression you dumb fuck  edit  my anger doesn t come from the fact that people are trying to give me hope  that is not the purpose of this post  the purpose of this post isn t to spread the message that  it never gets better  because it definitely can and has for many people  the issue is when people use the stupid phrase  it gets better  as if it as definite event that is      going to occur  and it is highly offensive to me because i believed that as a kid  i believed that things just had to get better  but they haven t  i m aware that things can get better  just like things can get worse  but it s not going to      get better because no one can really dictate that unless you can see into the future  saying that shit just sets people up for disappointment   it s a statement based on delusions and false hope  there are some people who will die depressed  there are some people who will die in pain  people whose illnesses will kill them  and to say that it gets better  as if depression is simply a phase or passing mood  is extremely invalidating and minimizes the severity of the illness  ,1
i hate people who say suicidal people are selfish  this life is my own and mine alone  do not tell me what to do with it  i am not going to keep living in pain and misery  just so the people around me dont feel sad  im sorry  its possible that some people will be heavily affected by my death  but i dont care enough to keep going    fuck you   person   for telling me that suicidal people are selfish and are sinners  fuck you to hell and back  ,1
i wish there was a reset button for life i really need one ,1
do you ever feel like suicide is your destiny  i mean  for me at least  its like theres no way around it  things get better  my life improves in ways that i didnt think possible  but at the back of my mind i still have offing myself as an option   its always like   lets see where this goes  if it all goes to shit  i can still end my life    since the moment that i first contemplated suicide  it seems inevitable  like im just waiting for a bad turn  ,1
quarantine would be heaven if i lived alone my family just makes me hate myself even more ,1
ive attempted suicide and my goodbye letter was shown to everyone hey   so just like it says in the title  ive attempted suicide but failed obviously  well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did  little did i know  that letter would be read by everyone  and i mean everyone  i woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter  i was so shocked and couldnt say anything for   seconds or more  apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me  my mother and all the people in the hospital read it too   i had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it   i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people    ,1
does anyone see weddings and instantly think   thats never gonna happen for me   ,1
do you feel like a useless npc   like a joke character   no one interacts with and always  alone no one gives a fuck about him   ,1
the worst feeling in the world is when you dont want to be alive but youre too big of a pussy to do it because you feel obligated to stay for other peoples well being i dont know why theyd even miss me  even want me around  i destroy everything i touch  in a way  im not cut out for this  life  thing  ,1
now i get why there are more suicides in this time of the year   ,1
i ve become the person i always feared of being underachiever  socially inept  unlikeable  unwanted  unmotivated  directionless and unlikely to ever leave home my hometown ,1
anybody else wishing that they could run away instead of killing themselves  i wish i had some money saved away and a car  i wish i could drive away and never come back to my life    i always wish for a simple life  i always dream i m driving to uruguay and that i m changing my name to hermano or whatever the fuck  i d teach kids to swim and spend my days getting stoned by myself  i d volunteer at a soup kitchen and write my books at night   but that never happens  i m completely by myself and in a relationship where i m most likely being used  nobody gives a fuck about me  i just want to be better  ,1
anyone ever lie in bed at night and think to yourself   i could end it all right now with this  knife  gun  pills  etc    i ve come quite close to trying it  but i don t have the courage to do so  ,1
 it gets better  is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they dont know what to say  it doesnt get better  when it gets better  it gets even worse afterwards  nothing good lasts forever  the bad wouldnt be bad without the good and vice versa  but the bad is just so  so fucking bad  im driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad  and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time  ,1
i get so angry when i hear about people who die in their sleep because it s not fair and it should be me   ,1
just please read it would mean a lot to me  i m so alone       it s close to midnight  it s dark and cold  my door is closed  as i lay about to fall asleep i hear something  i m half awake half asleep so i don t really acknowledge it  i turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again  but then i hear something  i open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is  it sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed  here i lay  trying to figure out what it is  then i hear a very loud  hey   yelled right in my ear  i instantly sit up and look around my room but of course i see nothing  i must just be paranoid                 it was a few months after my mom married him  i never really liked him  when he did what he did  i was too young to understand what it meant  he d put me on his lap  grab my sides and butt when my mother was working  he called me his  favorite   it was just touching then  how i wish it never had to be more                 we had just got back from a family party the first time it happened  it was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home i remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as i was already sleeping from the car ride home  their room was upstairs mine was in the basement  as he put me to bed he started touching me  by then i was awake  he was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth  i remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over  i was in so much pain  when he was done  he told me again how i was his favorite  i couldn t do anything but cry  the next morning my mom was already gone at work and there i was  stuck in a house with a monster                 it was going on for a few years now  yes  i did want and try to tell my mom about it  but i was so scared she wouldn t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so i never did  because he said if i told  she wouldn t want me anymore  in school my grades dropped  my attendance dropped  and i d never pay attention  i felt so alone and so scared  yes  i did self harm as i felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him  i did run away  and when my councilor found out  i talked to her  i told her an excuse saying i didn t wanna go home because i hated when he yelled  i couldn t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night  i couldn t tell her as much as i wanted to  i felt so isolated  she called him and he had picked me up from school  when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said i deserved it for being bad  my mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home  am   pm                 a few years later and it was still happening  i was sick every morning and when i told my friends about it they joked around saying i was pregnant  i laughed along but in my head i thought   could i really be    i remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as i got home  it was positive  i felt sick  then and there i wanted to throw up  no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him  my step father  i just wanted to die  i remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test  she yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age  little did she know  the father was the man she married  the man that has been sexually abusing me for years  my step father  i miscarried at    weeks  as bad as it may sound  i was glad i did                 my mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and i had so much relief after that  i thought finally no more pain  later that year  i was constantly getting in trouble  doing drugs  trying to be cool hanging with the  bad kids   i was expelled mid freshman year  i started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools  there i met a friend i ve known since kindergarten  we started hanging out everyday after school  i thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me  there was this friday where i was hanging out with a different friend when i ran into him and his friends  we decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me  high   being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid i took them and drank  my friend i was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with  so it was just me him and his other friend  we decided to go chill in a stairwell  i was so gone off whatever i had taken and from all the drinking i did  i remember him asking to have sex and i said no  i passed out and next thing i knew he was on top of me as his friend watched  i quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as i ran down the stairway crying i seen him and his friend high five  i called my sister for a ride home but didn t tell her what happen  when i got home i started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn t even ask me why i was crying  i went in my room wondering how could he do that to me  someone i knew since elementary school  how could this happen  as i laid in bed  i thought to myself that i was nothing  i was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age    from someone i called a friend  by then  all i wanted to do was die  i thought after that monster was out of my life i d be a little okay  yet it happened again from someone i knew and considered a friend                 i am    and i try to drink every weekend i can with older friends  because i didn t want to be sober on weekends when i was by myself i didn t want to be alone with my thoughts  because on weekdays i d be occupied by work  so weekends i d just drink every chance i could  it was not good  everywhere i went to drink  there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me  i thought to myself wow i really can t get away from this stuff  all my life i ve endured so much pain from people i thought were supposed to protect me  sure i drank and maybe you think it s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this  i couldn t get away from it  i thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out  i ve attempted suicide   times the past year  soon it will be my time to go  because all i feel is pain and loneliness  i m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night i have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because i m scared that he will be standing next to me even though i know he s gone     not the place to post  but at the time  i just needed it out of my mind  and yes  cops were eventually involved for everyone asking   ,1
no one gives a shit until you admit you want to die nobody gives a fuck how much pain youre in or how much youre suffering until you admit that you want to die  if you didnt give a fuck before dont pretend to now  instead of locking me up like some kind of rabid animal just give me some sodium pentobarbital so i can fucking die  ,1
i hate that i can t kill myself i just want to disappear  i don t want to die  i want to stop existing  dying involves violently ending your life  and leaping into the void of death  not knowing what exactly will happen  i just want to stop existing and to be forgotten   i m stuck and i hate it so much  ,1
do y all s ever want to kill yourself over a minor inconvenience and that makes you want to kill yourself even more cause other people have it way worse  like  i m reading posts on this sub where people s siblings loved ones have killed themselves and they want to follow  that one guy was a pedophile  people are extremely lonely ugly poor abused  and it s just an overall shit show   i dropped like   dishes at work today and that was enough to almost make me go over the edge  there are literally slaves that have known nothing but agony their entire lives in this world and i m just your average clumsy    year old who  in the grand scheme of things  has nothing to be worried about  fuck  ,1
i hate living in this world  everything is about money and i m sick of it  i don t want to sound ungrateful or like i m complaining  but i m really fed up with living in this world everything is so expensive i m so miserable  i feel like for the rest of my life i ll be slaving for some green paper till i m dead and gone  i m tired of paying bills and i m tired of living here  people keep saying that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that you want to  but how can you when everything is so hard  nothing is free here everything has a price tag  everything is not easy they make life a living hell  i feel so trapped i m tired of it i want out  the crazy thing is we cannot take none of this with us so why is it so much pressure and stress on us to make money  i understand this is the way the world was formed but it s honestly draining  ,1
just graduated from college today  planning on taking my life tonight  like the title says  today i received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight  i am not sure why i am making this post  maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why i took my life on a day i was supposed to be happy   heres my story for anyone who cares to hear it  i grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as i was  i also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong  growing up  i would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever i did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted  he didnt have anything wrong with him  like a mental physical disability  he just was allowed to live how he wanted while i took the blame  he ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while i went on to college   where i live  the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live  this meant that even working a job while going to college  i had no choice but to live at home  my family problems became less of an impact when i simply locked myself in my room the moment i got home  it was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time  that being said  it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation  they probably didnt even realize i had graduated at all   life at school wasnt any better for me  i was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so i was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there  i never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly  even if i wanted to talk to others  i found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety  so i just went class to class  graduated high school  did the same in college  never having friends never really bothered me probably because i dont know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place   the only part of my life i would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when i logged into wow  i was about    or    when i first started playing and that was the only time i ever found a place i felt like i belonged  i eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo  i very rarely spoke and never on coms  and i felt like i belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side  eventually what i would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when i became very close with someone i met in my current guild  we were both    and became very close and eventually became a couple  we were together for   years and helped each other finish high school and get into college  because of circumstances  we never ended up meeting in real life over those   years  mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective  despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years  neither of us had real life friends  but that never mattered because it was us against the world   it was      when she left me without a word or reason  she had been depressed  not eating  staying home from class  ect   for about   or   months prior and i did everything i could to try to lighten her day best i could but it seems that nothing worked  this was all very stressful for me and i am sure i might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time  but all i ever did was try to help  i was trying to plan a trip to visit her  but that wasnt easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the us  before i was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and i never heard from her ever again   the following two years were a living hell for me  i had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing  the whole reason i pursued that degree and career was so that i could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs  the plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her  however she was gone now  i was still accepted to the program  and had nothing else in my life so i just kept going with the program  flash forward to today  ive now graduated and even have a job in my field already  note new hire wage doesnt even pay enough to live on your own in this state  but i feel completely empty  the whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didnt even feel directed towards me  and all the congratulations felt wasted on me   i know i planned my entire life around someone who ive never met in person and i am fully aware how stupid that is  honestly i expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a  rd of my life up to that point  but regardless of that i know how dumb i am  my entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today  for me  was just a joke set up by another joke   this is why i have every intention of ending my life tonight  i have no family that will care enough if i am gone  no friends that will miss me  im sure my boss wont be happy that i am gone but i was only still a trainee anyways so losing me wont affect anyones schedules  and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than i do anyways   sorry for this being so long     years is hard to condense but i did my best   maybe didnt make any sense at times  and i am not sure this is even the right place to post considering ive never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed thats okay  maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why i died since i dont plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so i guess this will be it  thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that i died   edit  thank you everyone for your kindness  it really does mean a lot to me  i struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and i find it hard to reply to comments but just know that i am reading them and cant thank all of you who have shared your stories enough  im going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best i can  ,1
do you guys ever feel so horribly alone even when youre around close friends or family  i feel like nobody gets it  life feels so fake and plasticy  how does everybody do this day in day out   its been one tragedy after another for my whole life  out of    years only   months felt real and happy  i cling to that time in memory hoping i get to relive it  i took such advantage of it   the only enjoyment i get out of life is talking to my crush and my dad  i want to see them happy  theyre the only important things to me   is making others happy really all i exist for  i want to die so badly but it would hurt them  i hate it i wish they hated me so i could have an excuse  thanks for reading my idiotic rambling     you guys too  ,1
this world fucking sucks  nothing is fair  it s all luck  there are shitty people who succeed and good people who are suffering  i know i will kill myself eventually  why the fuck wouldn t i  our whole species is one giant fucking machine  the few good things are far outweighed by the bad things  i refuse to feel like this for seventy more years ,1
why does everyone think therapy is some miracle cure    cbt is literally a psychologist or psychiatrist or therapist or fucking whatever telling you things you already damn know and don t have the motivation or energy to execute   think positive    focus on breathing    exercise    find time to do things you enjoy   i could pull this shit out of my ass  i fucking hate it when people tell me to  get help   there is no fucking help  only i can help myself  and i can t    edit  the comments saying you only get what you put in  i m done  i have nothing to put in  that s kinda what depression does ,1
why do people who dont want to die die  like why the fuck is the universe giving cancer to some father of   who has an amazing life and wants to live  while i ve tried to kill myself    times in the past week  give me cancer you fucking prick  take it from someone else and give it to me i actually want  fucks sake  edit     hanging myself rn  hope i die  losing consciounes  love u  edit   sadly i survived   edit   the belt is looking kinda good again ,1
i tried to kill myself friday i took as many pills as i could and washed them down with whiskey  then i took a razor blade to my arm and cut it up until my arm and my basement was covered in blood  my parents found me and now i am at their house while they try to get me help  i survived and now i m looking ahead to the future  i must ve survived for a reason  it s going to be hard but i need to at least give this a chance  i hope all of you do as well  take care  ,1
suicide is the easy way out is that supposed to deter me   why would i want to take the hard way  im tired of taking the hard way  thats literally why im suicidal in the first place   trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isnt helpful    it just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more   i really dont get some of these arguments       edit  i dont mean to say that the actual act of dying taking your life is easy  but that suicide is giving up  and giving up is easier than continuing to live  i hope that makes sense   its like the actual suicide will be intense and scary  but afterwards ill never have to experience anything ever again and i wont ever have to be conscious again  ,1
sleeping is so peaceful  i hate waking up  when i am sleeping  nothing around me exists  no duties  no burdens  no depression nothing  i can just live  even dreamless sleeps  where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable  i can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments    i am so tired  so tired of everything  they always say  theres light at the end of the tunnel  but ive been running and running with no end in sight  no relief in sight  im just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man  ,1
does anyone else ever think to themselves  any day now i m going to kill myself  i just feel like i m constantly on some sort of pin and needle  just no way in hell i can survive anymore  each day is the same boredom and misery  prison  let me out  i just don t see where it s worth it  i m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn t there  self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up ,1
my despicable legacy today  as   th may ive decided to kill myself  not sure if its because ive finally gathered enough confidence  or if its because i finally understand things i didnt before  i do not seek help  however  attention would be nice  to be heard at least one time in my life  to finally show the world my most secret flaws  my archivements  the things ive accomplished  the bad memories  overall  to finally tell my despicable legacy    i feel invisible    ive been invisible my whole life  while never completely ignored  always felt invisible   i feel alone  even when im with the ones that are close to me  it is something ive been trying to stop for around    years  but finally give up   at first  i was born as an accident  ive never been told that  nor made feel that way  but is clear that a mother who is     and a father who is     didnt exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation   i was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family  i lived with my mother  her parents and my uncle until i was    then moved to a flat  with my mother and her new husband   from   to   life was decently good  i dont personally recall any bad experiences  but i was told recently from my grandmother that i would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers  i dont know why   my dad was poor by that time  he was still studying as a ecologist  he was present  to be fair  he was more present when i couldnt remember    from   to    i lived in the flat i mentioned early  i was there alone most of the day  now i think  what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of    well  one that clearly didnt care enough  at   i joined school  the same monotous hell i assisted for    years  i never really fitted with the average person  i wasnt an outcast  or a creep  i had friends  they werent good friends  but they were friends after all  we would normally go to each other houses and play together  watch movies  etc   i never did good in school  i barely did decent  parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of  by beating me  luckily my mother and dad broke up when i was around    so each of them went their way   my father never  ever hit me  he was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love  tho he never showed me love   nothing particulary especial happened from the age of   to     besides being bullied by some classmates  leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me  which i completely regret    at the age of    this odd feeling started in my chest  some kind of void  some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy  my happiness and somehow  my willing to live  i didnt understand it  i had no idea why it was happening  suddenly  the world was no more love painted  a great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me  to see everyone as an enemy  years later i understood that was when my depression began  my daily prison  the loneliness i feel every day  that was the starting point   at     i cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut  but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation  i enjoyed it to some degree  i never did it to a serious level  and i stopped fairly quick  it only lasted for around   months  months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body   i forgot to mention that ive been called  or been made feel ugly my whole life  untill today  so a natural doubt about myself  and my body arise  and its been here with me since so long      at this point im a bit drunk  getting everything ready for my departure  as i listen to theres no beauty left here  amazing album    sadly i never got hug any significant another  let alone kiss  i never felt the love of someone else  never got to cuddle anyone  to trust  to love  to have sex with  to share my thoughts  ive always been by my own  ive always been alone  what saddens me the most  is that ive never been heard  ive always been ignored   invisible  thats what ive been feeling like for about   years    everyone around me gets talked by others  others interact with others  but not me   it covers many aspects  not only been talked but    i dont know how to explain it  i am a somewhat smart person  but sometimes i believe im really invisible   sometimes i talk to people in real life  and they just ignore me   philosophy has been an interesting topic for me  yet i cannot answer myself  if im ignored like that  am i even there  was i part of a community    but this is about the good things i did  too   i joined the fire brigade  had a good time there  it filled myself more than any other activity  i helped men  women and children  tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness i felt    i also rescued a kitty that was pregnant  i called her mamou  she had   little kitties which i gifted to people i knew who would take good care of them    but its been   years since ive been living on my own  mamou died   weeks ago  which made me realize the futily of life  but overall  made something a bit more clear for me  it wasnt hatred what i felt for the world  but disappointment  weve come so far as a species  we have so much potential  but its been wasted  and me myself i am guilty of this  i havent done anything remarkable   i am disappointed at the selfishness  the antipathy  the greed  and the distancing of humans    for those reasons i am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body  or cremate it  i am sure my parents wont want a funeral for me  i mean  even less with whats going on with the world right now   that leads me to my next point  betrayal  backstabbing and abandon  thats what some of my friends did to me  they ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch  like a used tissue   sure  i did a mistake  i admit it  i did many mistakes  but looking at them in a objective way  is not much different of what our true nature is  in other words  i never did something worth abandoning your friend  and then getting them fired of their job   quarantine is fucked up  makes me realize that the little chances i had of meeting someone before  now are completely gone  tho it hasnt been all bad  i got fit  i lost a lot of weight  ive read hundred of classic and cult books  same for music    anyway  to the last point  the things i most regret in life  probably not being more myself  that would have probably brought more pain  but it is uncertain   i regret never meeting and loving someone  it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone  everyone but me    if you made it this far  i cannot properly explain how much i appreciate the time you dedicated reading this  this is more attention than all the one ive been given through my whole life  it felt really good to open up after so long  i am tomás renard  these are the last words i want to say before leaving this world  and venturing into the next one  if anyone is concerned  know i will leave happy that at least read this post  i will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life  a nice bottle of pipeño wine ,1
i told my abusive narcissistic sadist of a mother to  fuck off  eat the shit that comes out of your mouth   die painfully you sadistic cunt   right before cutting contact with her  my mother has been cruel  verbally  emotionally  psychologically   physically abusive ever since i can remember  for example when i was diagnosed with schizophrenia   severe depression when i was    she took a tarantula from outside  threw me in a closet  threw the spider in   locked me in there while screaming like a banshee  that   legged monstrosity bit me   times before i passed out from fear  when i woke up  there were   more bites  she always made me her scapegoat  the first out of my   suicide attempts took place when i was   years old  when she found out that i started cutting myself  she severely beat me   called me a mistake  years have passed   after starting to see a psychiatrist  i was diagnosed with severe ptsd   a severe anxiety disorder  i tend to drink to cope with my problems  if anyone were to personally ask me how i would describe myself  i d say   damaged beyond recovery   broken beyond repair   i barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares  i m    now   i ll be    this year  damn  to those who read this post  i need to know  was i wrong to tell her off like that  ,1
i just joined reddit  im    years old and suicidal  i have problems with porn  ive never had sex with a woman  at the suggestion of my therapist  he recommended i join reddit   so  im giving this a try   im    years old and suicidal   i live in new hampshire  usa   i have been thinking lately  that  it is my time to leave this world   i am also addicted to porn and have been viewing it for years   ive never had a girlfriend  nor have i ever had sex with a woman   i have only seen one escort in boston  massachusetts   i was excited  too excited  about the prospect of having sex that while the escort and i were lying in bed nude  she was caressing my chest up and down  and she put her hand over my d  ck  my rocket launched unexpectedly   yes  premature ejaculation   sometimes it happens   needless to say  we didnt have sex   i am so depressed and lonely   i have come to the realization that im unattractive to women and that there is no point in living anymore   i hate my job   i work in a call center for a major boston based insurance company   its a terrible job   i get yelled at by people and im completely exhausted every day after talking on the phone with customers   my job has nothing to do with my college degree   i majored in marine transportation while attending a maritime academy   i worked as a junior ships officer aboard oil tankers for   years  but eventually i was fired   the captain who fired me thought that i was incompetent   my porn use has escalated   i look at it almost every morning before i have to sign on to my work computer to take calls from customers   im working from home right now because of covid      also  i dont look at porn on my work computer   im not that stupid   i only look at porn on my personal computer   in       i asked out a woman at work who was older than me   she was in her early   s   a beautiful blonde who had a very sexy face and a beautiful body   anyway  i got rejected and sometimes i think she rejected me because she thought i was ugly   im currently seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the therapy just doesnt seem to work for me   i feel so hopeless like nothing will ever get better   i dont think that i will ever find a woman because i am unattractive and skinny   i was going to the gym to lift weights  but then i stopped   i did attempt suicide about a year ago   after my attempt  my family suggested that i go to the hospital   so  i went to portsmouth regional hospital in new hampshire into their behaivoral health unit   i spent   days there   after i got out of the hospital  i felt better but then later on i started looking at porn again and felt depressed and lonely   ive tried dating sites like  match com  https   match com  and  okcupid com  https   okcupid com  and havent had any success   i had a subscription for about       years and decided to unsubscribe recently because i just wasnt getting any responses from women   the only thing that keeps me going are my two nieces who are   and   years old whom i enjoy playing with like hide and go seek  ride bikes  play catch  play monopoly and swimming in a pool   i just love them so much   any advice   i plan on seeing another escort because my goal is to have sex with a woman   i just dont i have much of a life left in this world   my uncle committed suicide at    years old and ive been strongly considering the same thing   maybe sooner if not later when i reach      thank you for reading my post  ,1
likely wont commit suicide  but if someone pointed a gun at my head  id probably let them pull the trigger  does anyone else feel this way  ive been depressed for so many years  and ive been suicidal all this time  ive yet to attempt suicide  although ive come very close   i doubt ill commit suicide any time soon  partially due to the small spurts of dim hope i feel once in a blue moon  the bigger reason though  is because my sole living direct family member is having a rough patch  and i fear theyd kill themselves too   nevertheless  if someone threatened to shoot me with a gun or i was caught up in a situation that endangered my life  i probably wouldnt mind too much  it would be even better if i could sacrifice my life for someone else maybe then my life wouldnt have been in vain  i recognize the hypocrisy in that statement  after all  if i were willing to sacrifice my life for someone else  then why not sacrifice myself and live for the sake of my family members life  i suppose that makes me selfish     and yet  i cant help but feel drawn to such a death  dying at the hands of someone else would give me a chance to die without the guilt of willfully abandoning my only family    ,1
i spent   yrs writing this horror book  making a soundtrack for it  and making it viewable like a film  i put my heart into something that will go nowhere  i just want to fucking die  i ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus  i m so stressed i put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer  so many hours spent at university studying and practicing  i would honestly stay at the library until it would close at   am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at   am  i won the praises of my professors  taking honors classes  being told i will go far  all for a creative writing degree that i cant do anything with  but its been my dream since i was    and read harry potter to be a writer  im    now  that dream turned into a nightmare    ive thought a lot about form and what a book could be  i felt literature has to be updated  because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours  so i made a soundtrack for this book i wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and i made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it     and now what  post it to reddit  hope it will go viral by spamming it  all that will do is get trolls to spit on something i spent so much time and energy on  go to a publisher  so they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people  and to get a publishing deal  it would take months  and before i could a publishing deal  i would need to get a literary agent  which also would take months  and then  it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves  and then  on top of all this  to add insult to injury  i  the writer  would make very little  the profits  if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent  this is because i would just be starting out  im not a veteran established writer like murakami or rushdie  they can get better deals  me though  i would have to wait   years and see very little in return     i have it all already prepared though and available right now  i just cant reach an audience  i dont know how to  in my mid   s i had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity  precisely because i did post on reddit  a lot of people seemed to like what i was doing  but  it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because i was posting something i made  like its the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something i put a lot of work into  its not like i was making hundreds of posts  any post i would make where i would say   i made this  it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldnt even take the time to read what i wrote or listen to the poem i would read   they would hate my post  just because i posted about something i made  i mean they treated it like i was forcing my work down their throats  but am i forcing my work on people by making a post about it  you dont have to click  its just a post and i would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who i havent reached yet might like what i do  is that really so terrible  i dont understand why people treat it like its the worst thing in the world and like its so aggravating and annoying  companies can have advertisements  but me  a single person  trying to do something on my own  its not called advertisement  its called  spam  instead  it was so frustrating  i didnt become famous  im not saying this  but i did get attention eventually and i did grow in popularity  precisely because i did post to reddit and stopped saying  i made this  to  i found this   instantly got more recognition  one night while i was drunk i deleted everything i made and my entire online presence  because i was so frustrated by this        subscribers on youtube  videos with tens of thousands of views  all gone  i could try posting my things on reddit again  but oh my fucking god there is no way im doing that a second time  it was a nightmare to get that far  im not making that mistake a second time  except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and i hope peopled be a bit more tolerant and to provide context heres what i wasted   fucking years of my life on  https   www youtube com watch v pplcoexhumi   what else can i do  write like rupi fucking kaur and shit all over instagram like all these  instapoets   just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures  i could get fame for that  itd be very easy  but i wouldnt be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what i accomplished  suicide i guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless  if you dont whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure    i lost my job because of the coronavirus  i cant bring myself to get unemployment  i have never been on government assistance  i feel weird even getting this        check  i grew up in a libertarian objectivist household  i cant get something for free  i can only be ok with myself if everything i have i worked for  i always told myself i would die before being in this position  i try to have integrity and pride  this is just humiliating  and it was humiliating working at my previous job  knowing i could have capable of so much more  knowing i could have done so much more with my life  that at one point i honestly had fans   even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me  and people were praising what i was doing in college   i feel like nick drake https   www youtube com watch v jofgm mfiqw   ive never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things  theres a million other things  i have no money  i dont have money for rent next month  i dont have money for food  some of you might not understand but id rather die than take unemployment benefits  i am more suicidal than you can possibly know  i am trapped  stuck  i cant believe im    and in this position  all those dreams i had as a kid about being the next jk rowling   ive been doing a lot of research  i have a method figured out  it seems almost inevitable that i will end it  i cant do this anymore  ,1
my dad recorded a video of me walking down the street he showed it to me on his pc  showing my hands in my pockets  my head down  obviously looking quite dead faced  telling me he showed this to me to show what u look like to the rest of the world  an overweight loser who will never get anothet girlfriend stuck in his own thoughts  i feel so weird and dirty that  i was recorded the one time i wasnt putting on a front  pretending i had my shit together head held up high  maybe its his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish i could stop existing  i fucking hate myself more  my family obviously hates me  maybe if i go they will feel sad for a bit but then as time goes on theyll forget about me  i know a spot off the local trail  maybe tonight  im not yet sure   i want this pain in my head to go away  im sick of feeling stuck ,1
i just took all the remaining pills of my   prescriptions  goodbye  title says most of it  a month ago i tried to jump off the golden gate bridge and got detained and     ed  things haven t gotten better and i m just done  this life isn t for me  it s my time to go  i m really sorry to all the people who love me  i feel bad but i cant stick around anymore  i hope things get better for anybody reading this  goodbye  update  i survived  i m in the icu right now  they said i would ve died if i didn t come in  thank you everyone for your kind messages and caring  i ll try to reply to everyone but it ll take some time considering    thank you all   ,1
i made a post on this subreddit asking for someone to give me some hope and somebody downvoted it  fuck this  guess its a sign   edit  thank you all so much for the overwhelming support  it means more to me than you might think  ,1
will i ever commit suicide  probably not  do i think about doing it  every  single  day  i dont know if i could ever bring myself to do it  there has been attempts before in the past  but never too serious to the point where i needed to be hospitalized  once saw a post that said   can i have a    day free trial of being dead   never related to something so much in my damn life  let me be an accident  not to the point where i die  but maybe in a coma for a while  just to escape    im the friend that no ones wants to hang out with  i dont have anybody  i made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college  mainly just rumor based  and i never bounced back from it because of my anxiety  i dont know who i am  i dont know what love is  being suicidal is the only feeling i truly and wholeheartedly know  which is both comforting and petrifying at the same time    lord forgive me  im going to need it   ,1
i want to kill myself to avoid the future generally speaking  my life isn t terrible right now  but i know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me  so much so that i m willing to end it all to avoid it    maybe i m just overreacting  since what i m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through  but i really don t want responsibility  i hate that the more i age  the more people expect of me  i don t want to turn    and suddenly be an adult  thrown out to the world  there s so much that will have to be done in my life and i can t handle it    getting into university  getting a job  a drivers licence  hell even just the idea of having to get groceries    it all scares me  i feel like everything is happening too fast    i hate that this problem isn t something i can just fix  it will never  get better  because what troubles me is life itself  how am i supposed to fix the fact that i m too anxious to live  ,1
anyone else feels like a burden to their friends  i feel like my only friend is tired of me  honestly  i dont blame her  dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring  whenever i bring up the fact that i dont feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol i feel bad saying all this  she means a lot to me and im sure she means well but   damn i feel really lonely and alone with my problems  maybe im just whiny and selfish but sometimes i want more than  dont think about it  others have it worse   sometimes i feel like im the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she wont get uncomfortable around me  is it selfish to feel this way  i feel really alone  ,1
my name is tyler  that s my real name this is my only account  i m highly suicidal  have been since i was about     years old  i m    now and it s different now  i m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight  thanks for reading if you do     growing up  i was always a really weird kid  i distinctly remember that i had just seen the world differently  it seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most  me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were mario or pokémon because neither of our families could would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv  it was so simple back then and looking back so pure   but it felt like we were there  we didn t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things  as far as i know i was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age    we would fight  i would hurt him  not bad  typically young brother bs  but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work  my father more so was  he is still with us  a rigid  traditionally hispanic in parenting  angry  regretful person  when he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on  it was better to just stay quiet  this didn t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we d bicker to just cry out loud  our dad would come in  beat my ass and i would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop  my real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about    seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground  telling me if i wanted to fight to put my hands up and when i did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists  i was around    years old  maybe give or take a couple years  not sure  i have terrible memory of most my life  as i got older  my brother and i actually started bonding  he liked the way i started standing up to our dad no matter how bad i was beat down  he s told me i inspired him  my mom btw is was awesome  but didn t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn t bear to watch  i can t blame her  not much negativity felt towards her for i know she unconditionally loves me and that must ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well  moving forward  i m a decent student  normally averaging around low a s my brothers straight a s if not     s  not much of a big deal there  my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens  for every a we got in a semester she d give us like    dollars or something  it was dope so we did well   through out life i feel like i found connections that i would replace for my fathers love  through friendship  i grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends  i would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit  but it was a really freeing time out i remember  fast forward  around when i was     my brother    my mom bought me a bass guitar because i had been getting into random enough japanese rock from the anime i would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member  my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment  figured it would help us bond  it did  it really did and i thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life  i was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar  going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers  producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter  but at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my    year old brother in the band  i started a couple bands  the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar  this was a turning point   back to family life  my dad started to realize he was aging and i was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body  this didn t stop anything  but only extended our fights into actual fights  my dad  a correction officer  doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time  all while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and i was a mistake  nothing like this was said to my brother  unless in terms of how i ve manipulated him into becoming just like me  i became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold  two accounts stick out immeasurably to me  the first being  funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come  my brother was upstairs and screamed tyler help dad just hit me  in a blind fury  i bum rushed my dad onto the floor  commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face  chest  balls  anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of  it used to just be me  that s where you should ve left it   it was a powerful moment  my father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me    twas still a sweet victory  no fear   i ll speed up the rest  me and my bro made a band  everyone betrayed us  we made another and took full control of who was in it  wrote all the music  what we looked like  who we recorded with  and what not  with his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called fearless records  we played metal  it was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you ve read thus far    we did it in four months   i got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams  i cried and got sent home early  a record that i wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to  all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance  it was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen  at least our small town  every time he said we were garbage  we should try something else  i couldn t sing and my brother should play something nice  every time he laid a hand on us  put into songs and we did it in four months  still makes me proud to this day man    btw  this isn t a story about my father  he is not the reason i want to kill myself anymore   the label fucked us over  made us record   different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits  our deal was good n no need to recoup anything  just disband   this is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life  a foe i don t know if i can beat this time  throughout the story so far  i had a flame inside of me  the whole time a purpose to prove  a will to fight  i always told people that i wasn t sad  i was angry  and the anger forged who i was  a determined  skill ful musician  with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match  a man who did it  but when that all went away  i became a worm  but not yet   shit with my dad cooled off  he retired  i m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and i stopped holding the past against him  at this point i had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around  was he still an incredibly ill informed  ego centric prick  yeah  but i was a different person now and couldn t be bothered with it  most times shrugging off his comments  i had worth now   me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act  but it didn t last long  we did an all over the place ep that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it  drummer left  became a solo artist  he s a whole other story  i can t help but feel as tho i m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as i m     years older than both of them  i was always the dad figure to them    fuck it tho  rock n roll  we did it once we ll do it again  me and my brother move to los angeles california in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap  emo  metal  and pop genres  we moved with two of my friends from ny and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms  the other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly  shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this      sqft  it was not comfortable to say the least  however the one room mate in specific  targeted my brother  who at this point basically didn t talk to either of them   this is point one and point   is my confesssion  and then there was me  i had developed an alcohol problem  not that i drank every day or even every weekend  but when i did  i became a different person  i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well  my brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed  i refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there  amped on on about    jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying  i flipped shit on my brother  cursing him out  saying i didn t need him  i could pay someone    dollars to do what he does  etc  it was awful  and it was the last straw for him  within the next week or so he packed up  quit his job and went back home    i was heartbroken  but covered it up with anger  my other two room mates  if you can believe it  convinced me that i didn t need him and that he held me back  i thought i d be okay and he d come back  i left our room exactly how he left it for months  he didn t    this was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date  i spend every night analyzing the past  and i think i ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father  then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it  i m lost  i don t know what to do  my personality feels like it s splitting  some days i m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days i m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn t have on post mates so he doesn t have to leave the apartment  when i sit down and try to write music  i can  but i don t feel it anymore  it s the only skill i have  i didn t go to a real college because of the deal  i m not good at anything and i m not interested in anything other than music  but there s no inspiration left in me  nothing really makes me happy anymore  i had a gf  nothing  broke up with her  nothing i have a new one  i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing  i have written   new songs  nothing  i post a photo on instagram  nothing  i go to work  nothing  i watch a movie  nothing  everything just seems so pointless now  i don t see myself as the star i once did  i don t even believe myself when i sing  or have conversation with people  it s like i m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don t even care about  i just want him to die  i just want to stop wondering and working and fighting  i don t want to do it anymore  and i was the relief of death    idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic  thanks for listening  ,1
attempt failed  currently in the hospital  i tried i really did  but the second i took the pills i instantly regretted it  i called      in the ambulance is when i really noticed what i had done  and having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me  im currently in the hospital  i cant leave my room unless its to go to the bathroom  i cant even close my curtain to get privacy  they took every single cable and metal object out of the room  im in terrible pain  i didnt sleep at all last night  hospital beds are the worse  i miss my bed and my dog      despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive  the nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little  one nurse even gave me her number in case i ever need some support  ive never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers  every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live  thankfully i didnt ingest too much pills to damage my body too much  just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening    but this has made me realize a lot  life really is worth living  no matter your situation  there are plenty of people who can be there for you  every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me  and this has given me the will to live    i should be getting out by tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave  until then im in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but its good to know that theres people out there who truly care    to all the people considering suicide  please dont do it  its not worth it  i truly thought i had no one and my family wouldnt care  but seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one youre wrong  the selfish decision i made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on  were all strong enough if we really try    stay strong and reconsider your choice     edit  i didnt think my post would get so much attention  seeing as my other posts wouldnt get much  im sorry if i cant reply to all of the comments its really a lot  however  thank you to all the kind people and positive messages  im glad to see my story is helping others as well   ,1
cant talk to anyone about being suicidal because it will just lead to them calling the police on me and becoming prisoner in a hospital i dont wanna live anymore  and i certainly dont wanna be chained to a bed in a psych ward  i cant talk to my friends or family cause they just immediately call the police and say im a danger which gets me locked in a hospital for a week and      dollars in bills  i cant even act suicidal  im just forced to sit here and think  i never asked to be born  i didnt ask to be alive  i dont want to  i hate myself so much and theres no reason to live my whole life in poverty and sadness  people just want me to be alive so they dont have to deal with my death  i hate myself and i hate my life ,1
guilt tripping is not ok ive been told all my life  dont kill yourself you will hurt everyone else    its selfish   think about the people who have no choice  i fucking know that     you dont think i know that im going to make people sad and hurt  do you even care what i might be going through    dont tell people that its selfish  they have been trying so hard  they just want the pain to end    thats all i want  it hurts too much  stop telling me what i already know  i dont want to hurt anyone but i cant keep doing this shit ,1
take a second to look around   do it  just take a second to look through this sub and look at all the people struggling to find a reason to live  some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds  some people never had a chance  some are nihilistic and dont see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression  and who cares  genuinely who cares  ive come on here just to rant and id bet any amount of money you whos reading this did the exact same  everyone is self absorbed  the only people who care about you  if any  cant help  they have their own lives to live  they beg people with depression and who are suicidal to  talk  well who do we fucking talk to  i dont have the money for a fancy fucking therapist  i honestly dont just feel sorry for myself right now   i feel sorry for mankind  do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didnt see them  for whatever reason this   st century  though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history  is also some on the most uncaring  sociopathic fucked up times in history  well    maybe not  maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory    no one cares about you  no one cares about me  i wish i could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards earth  im done  i really dont know how i am going to get through christmas this year so i might as well leave a trail so my family dont blame themselves if i do something  i doubt i will  im a pussy and too scared  so ill just sit in my misery  watch another year come and wonder how i will survive this new year coming  ,1
update thank you  everyone   who pushed me to live         thank you everyone who helped         so after posting this    days ago i wrote my best friend whos out of state a suicide note and i closed my phone and social media and popped some pills and right then there was a knock at my door and it was the cops they took me to a psychiatric ward were i spent a few days a little over a week it felt like a month but i swear i meet some amazing people and my family and friends visited every day and now im on my medication and things are turning around a lot       im moving out to my best friend and taking a semester off to recoup from school i explained to my friend about the  k and she wasnt sweating it she said my life was more important but long story short everything worked out i love you strangers and thank you for helping me       xoxoxox ,1
the only reason i havent killed myself is because im scared of not knowing what death is   ,1
you ever just feel sad and want to write a huge rant but you can t come up with the energy or the words  haha yeah ,1
i take reassurance in the fact i can kill my self if things get too bad i guess i m sort of at peace with the idea now  it s strangely given me a tranquility to life and made me not worry  as if things get too bad i can just end it  ,1
found and performed cpr on dead friend looking for help i found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under   weeks ago now  i called the ambulance and untied her and gave her cpr for       minutes before anyone showed up  they ended up working on her for       minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma  i had to call her boyfriend and ex best friend and we all spent the night in the icu  i spent a week in shock  meeting her parents who flew in from interstate  her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her  for the first    days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support  i had begun grieving  although i was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books  on about day     they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time  it was a miracle  and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience  all she could do was lay and sob  i spent a few days with her like this  i would talk to her and i knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things i would say would calm her back down  it was so incredibly painful  i was convinced over these days i had ruined her life by doing what i did  she was dead when i found her and that i had brought her back to a life of hell  it was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever  i just couldn t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be  she ended up within    hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own  speaking a little and even started moving  it s all been so surreal  now that shock has worn off i m having constant flash backs and panic attacks  i have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self  it s so painful  i truly want to die  i feel so conflicted and invisible  because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost  and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her     and traumatised i am from finding her  untying her  giving her cpr while i knew she was dead  cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from  and spending   straight weeks by her side through every single state in icu  i even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her  i m so heart broken  i want to die  i feel invisible and i don t know where to put my pain  i have nobody because it s too heavy for anyone to deal with  and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which i understand but it s like they don t understand that she hung herself  i m traumatised for life  and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows she s still very brain damaged and doesn t even know what s happened to her  i have never posted before  i don t know anyone who s had any kind of similar experience  it s so layered and i have a    year history of self harm and drug use  both of which i had recovered from  years since i have self harmed and   months since i have used drugs or alcohol  but all i want to do is hurt myself in anyway i can   edit  she had hung herself on the back of her door  so by opening her bedroom door that s how she was released from hanging  i called     immediately as i untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat  all i did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead not conscious and call     and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because i was in so much shock i was just doing what they were telling me to  even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and i had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom i had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then i realised i was about to do cpr  i was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying i know  my name  but just keep helping her until help gets there  so i did ,1
anyone else surprised they survived through       i m surprised  how the fuck did i do it  i think about suicide almost every day but i did it   ,1
people tell me they would be sad and upset if i died  but they never want to talk to me or do anything with me  feels like im dead to them anyhow  ,1
it s a sad world when a    year old kid is contemplating suicide to escape his emotionally abusive parents  i m sick of being called  a fu king animal  by the people who are supposed to raise me to be a productive adult  it s years of emotional trauma brought up by their anger towards each other that they take out on me verbally  i don t get help for any of my issues and they refuse to believe that i m spiralling towards rock bottom    i thought since my friends couldn t care less  my parents called me ungrateful a hotline just told me  life will be okay soon   i ll just open up to the two strangers here on reddit  ,1
fantasising about being saved  i often daydream about trying to jump off a bridge and having someone grab me from the edge  hold me tight and tell me it will be okay    we all want what we can t have  i guess  ,1
i hate humanity i hate being a member of humanity  i hate all the terrible worst aspects of this barbaric species  i hate all the injustices that humans commit against each other  being alive on this earth is pure abject terror and i can feel fires raging beneath my skin i want to get out of here i need to get out of here  ,1
another day another    hours of laying on the couch waiting to die  ,1
i kind of want to fail a suicide attempt just to show people that im struggling i know this is fucked up  but i feel like no one cares about me  no matter what i do or say  no one ever worries about me  no one ever notices my cries for help  i just feel like the only way to make them notice how shitty im actually doing is by doing something drastic like this  but then again  would anyone even care  ,1
i called a hotline last week  now i owe thousands    m here  tried overdosing last week but i still woke up  then i called the hotline cause i needed someone to talk to  i thought it would be like free therapy  boy was i wrong  told them what happened  even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that i was a risk to myself  they got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone i was calling from and going to the address listed  since i moved out  they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there  my heart sank when my brother called me cause i pretty much swatd him just then  the popo called me and i told them my address  they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after  they told me i needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary  now for context  my mountain of debt  a car accident  and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day  when the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what  i have zero insurance   i voluntarily go with the emts  stayed in an emergency room for   hours  then was discharged    fast forward to now and i just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand    ive been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down  some nights i think about how if i havent sought help from the hotline that day i might be better off than i am today  maybe alive or dead  but probably better off either way  i feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone  i didnt leave a suicide note that day  i probably wont ever leave a note when i go  ideally  id just fade away  ,1
do you ever go to sleep early wishing you never wake up  i have been doing that every night for the past weeks  i try to sleep early thinking and wishing that will be the last time i will be awake  ,1

for once  i just want to stop being the punchline of everyones jokes   ,1
i ve started wishing that i would randomly die of a natural cause in order to avoid suicide  over the past month leading into june has been the worst its been in a while  almost anything has sent me into the thoughts of killing myself  about two years ago i used to cut to deal with this but i stopped and have been clean since  i still sometimes drag slightly sharp items across my skin but never enough to cut or leave a mark  now suicide is an every day thought in my head even on good days  im a minor and not allowed to seek treatment or medicine  i firmly believe that when i go it will be due to my own hand  whenever i get sick or feel pains that are abnormal  i no longer tell anyone in hope that it ll kill me before i do and that my family and friends will have me dead due to something medical and not suicide  i don t know what i believe in but i have even found myself praying to have a stroke or a heart attack just to end it all or praying to fall asleep and not wake up  i don t know what to do anymore  im struggling to live  ,1
i dont want to kill myself but i see no other future other than me killing myself i know it sounds weird  some people die of heart attacks  other suffer years of battle from cancer i see myself killing myself at some point  its like a vision that i have and it doesnt go away  almost like its my fate  ,1
the plan you take a nice shower  you put on your comfiest sweater and fuzzy socks  it s the middle of the night  nice and dark and quiet  ideally it s raining  you prepare your favourite meal  eat until you feel just right  pet the kitties goodbye    they were always there for you  dont cry  they will be loved by your relatives or other kind people of this world    you wrote out a note explaining everything  hand written  over and over  hell  it ll never say it all but it gets the point across  they will get a glimpse into what you were thinking  no more frantic late night texts  no more of them pretending to care  no more troubling the ones you love the most  they ll be sad at first but in time they ll remember all the good things about you and thats what they ll say    she was so sweet  her heart was too big for this world  she had so much potential  we all loved her so much    so you ll tuck into bed  knowing all that  you ll finally feel at peace  thankful  it s over  no more pain  get extra comfy  cover up  put the gun to your head and pull the trigger    then perfect  sweet  sleep and silence forever  the only true thing that lasts forever in this world  death  ,1
anyone else s suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things  i don t even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them  but   times out of    they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic ,1
i tried killing myself today  i wanted to jump off the top of a church tower  about   m up  the church was supposed to be open  but just when i got there  a man came out from the entrance and ushered me out the gates because the church was closing early today  somewhat ironically the name of the church is  our saviours church    talked with a close friend just now and im gonna seek professional help tomorrow  this time this shit has gone too far  had i arrived even half an hour earlier  i wouldnt be here right now  such a surreal feeling  ,1
i no longer plan on making it out of       i ve had enough  i m tired of crying myself to sleep  i m tired of constantly being sad and unsatisfied with my life  i m tired of seeing everyone going forward but myself  i m tired of being unattractive no matter how many times i try to alter my appearance  i m tired of losing friends  i m tired of people forgetting me  i m tired of college  i m tired of daydreaming about shit that s never gonna happen  i m tired of being alone  i m tired of not being desired  i m tired of being the ugly friend  i m tired of being the ugly sister  i m tired of being anxious around people  i m tired of isolating myself because i m so damn insecure  i ve had enough  i don t have an exact date set on when i m going to kill myself but i know i m definitely not making it out of       i m fucking tired  ,1
i am the kid that tries to join your friend group but fails  i am the kid that can t take a hint  i am the kid that no one likes  i am the weird kid  i want to die  so i have always been that weird kid who kinda tries to join a friend group and they hint they don t like you but your motivated to join anyways  i m super weird  everyone thinks i m annoying  and it goes much deeper than that  yes  there are some parts of my life such as family that i m lucky for  but i just wish i was with different people  i want to die  why was i put on this world if my only purpose was to be called names  bullied  have no friends  and be the most annoying person on planet earth  why did they do this  please help me  i m so tired of me giving in and asking to be invited to things and trying to be friends but they won t give back  i have tried with everyone  i m tired and crying  and i don t wanna die before    but i think i should  i don t know what to do and i m crying as i write this  why  why ,1
being born ugly sets you up to fail they say looks don t matter  but unfortunately that isn t true  for some of us  the amount of grooming  styling and exercising we do just can t fix bad genes  while adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive  being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effects  get made fun for appearance as a kid teen     don t have anyone to hang with     shattered confidence     staying home on weekends and not talking much during school     not developing social skills     being socially inept as an adult  most of my quirks are in my bone structure so it would take some serious plastic surgery to address them  i m so angry at myself for skipping on an opportunity to fix a very big flaw with my appearance   years ago because some yes men convinced me i was okay  i m not  ,1
i am the comedian i am the one who everybody says makes them smile  i make people laugh  i build them up  i reinforce positivity  i shine a bright light on every person i encounter  i ve been called  the happiest guy at  company name    i love giving compliments   why  because i know how it feels to need to hear those things   i am the one  who once the adrenaline of building up others dies down  is in the darkest place  i laugh  i joke  i praise  i do what i do because i want no others to feel the way i do  but if only they knew    ,1
i tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows january   th      i was driving home listening to amy winehouse and decided that this was my time  it was on a windy  empty country road  late at night  in torrential rain  accidents happened there all the time  i had just finished having dinner with my housemate at university and was on my way to my hometown to see my family  no one would suspect a thing  i closed my eyes  let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down    when i opened my eyes my vision was blurred  but i could see that my windshield had caved in  i proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat  opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass  there was no shock  no confusion  i felt a small sense of relief that i wasn t paralysed  and a bigger sense of relief that i hadn t hit anyone else  but other than that  i still felt just as dead inside as i had prior to the crash   i went through the motions  strangers came to my aid  followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents  i laughed and smiled through it  cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late  i had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in   i had aquaplaned across the road  accelerating into a hedge  before flipping my      corsa four times  knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning   m down the country lane  i had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest  i m only       if i was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in  i should have been dead    instead  i spent a week in hospital lying on my back  completely immobilised  awaiting my c  spinal surgery  post surgery  my doctor told me he d seen mri scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed  so i guess the fact that i walked out of hospital after   days with just a neck brace was a silver lining    since then i ve carried on keeping up appearances  things have changed  some for the better  some for the worse  for a while  my frustration that i had survived was outweighed by my relief that i wasn t paralysed  and in truth that is still the case  but my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off  it s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief  what s more important  should i continue to suffer silently in a world where i feel completely lost and alone  just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway  ,1
thanks reddit thanks to everyone who gave support  because of you i didnt kill myself ,1
failed suicide attempt yesterday i clean my house  packed my bag with robe and went into the woods  i arrived there at   pm and smoked a few sigartes and listened to the animal noises  i prepared my rope and let myself drop  the first minute was peacefull but then i started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away  if i didnt have my pocket knife to cut the rope i was gone  but i was to much of a coward and cut it  some people know like my father but they dont care  i really need a hug  i havent heard or seen someone familiar in the past  months  i really grave love  understanding  kidness  a hand  a shoulder  i am so lonely  i dont understand that people dont care what happened yesterday i dont  am i this bad of a person  u dont think so im just mentally unstable  anyone from belgium whom wants to be my friend  i dont  want to be pathetic but im so lonely i miss love so much  im going to stop now i dont want to cry    thanks in advance for the people reading this  ,1
nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide i often fantasize about dying  i dont want to be here anymore  its not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically  theres literally no point  the only thing holding me back from doing it is i dont want to do that to my parents   besides feeling like i just want to be dead  i also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me  i cant shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and im never going to be happy or deserve to be happy  theres this void in me and no matter what i do  nothing fills it    i tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating  i told him about my self harm and how i just want to die  about the self harm  he told me to cut the  right way  if i wanted real results  for the depression and suicidal thoughts  he said he felt the same except he had a worse life  so his depression was more justified  he said i have a lot to be happy for    it just made me want to kill myself even more  but the thing is  i dont think i want to die  i just wish everything would stop and i could start over as someone else   and honestly  when i think about killing myself  i fantasize about it not working  but working just enough to hospitalize me  its a sick fucking thought  i know  i think the main reason i want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that im not just faking it or  choosing  to be depressed  its not just for attention    which is ironic to say  considering i want to do it literally to get their attention  but i just feel like  in order for my pain to be taken seriously  i need to show it to people somehow  ,1
sleep just isnt sleep anymore  its an escape   ,1
no one really cares  theyre only trying to make themselves feel good  a while back i removed myself from the contacts of my friends  trying to isolate myself before i stepped in front of a bus  no one spoke to me  ever reached out  i had to initiate every conversation  i was the runt hanging around that no one had the balls to formally tell to fuck off  of course  the moment i do leave  everyone suddenly cares  everyone is buzzing my phone asking whats up and how im doing  they even got a hold of my parents  it escalated at some point to where the only one from that group i had any respect for is on the phone pleading that i dont die  that suicide is irrational and that i should consider meds   guess what  i said sure  i wont die  ill go back business as usual  and you know what  it is business as usual  i am never anyones first choice  i havent spoken to another human in over a month  even when i come back from an attempt its like i died anyway  really glad i got talked out of it  it would fucking suck if i missed out on being ignored and forgotten again  ,1
the only existence sadder than being suicidal is being suicidal but with the option of suicide taken away from you because if you were to kill yourself  you would kill someone else too i dont think my mom would be able to survive me dying ,1
why do they always say that  death is not a solution   and then fail to provide one  if nobody can give me a solution  then maybe i should do things my way  the alternative is you guilting me for wanting to die without providing me with another way to deal with this  ,1
games aren t fun anymore  books aren t fun anymore music doesn t sound good anymore    exploring the city isn t fun anymore   painting isn t fun anymore    i still have no friends    i really wish i was dead ,1
im quite convinced that depression will kill me someday  and im okay with that  until that day comes  however  i can only do my best  even if that means wallowing in existential dread  failing at everything  losing all meaningful connections and watching the world hustle away while i sink into the void  it is okay      everything is okay  ,1
killing yourself is selfish  that s what most people would say  but do those people know what you struggle with on a daily basis  how hard it is to get out of bed  how hard it is to look into a mirror  how much pain they have been through  it isn t fair  i give nothing but love and i get shit in return  i feel as if life isn t right for me  i know i d hurt people if i were to die  my mother would be destroyed the most but secretly does she know her child is already dying inside  that her child has no reason  none at all to keep trying  i don t want to be in pain  but the ones i love the most  hurt me the most  so why keep trying  if i love someone so much to the point where they can hurt me        times and i still continue going   why keep going  they obviously don t care about me  they love the fact that they ll never lose me  i don t want to die  i am just tired of feeling trapped in my mind  ,1
mental illness is bullshit life is shit  the world is going to hell  were slaves to our wages  theres no fucking point to anything and its got nothing to do with mental health  the world is just shit and i want nothing to do with it  im not fucking sick  im sick of people telling me im sick in a piece of shit world thats sick  if anything  i see the world better than most  theres really no point to be here  why prolong this endless suffering  if anyone says im selfish  theyre the fucking selfish ones for wanting me to be here only to help them while i fucking suffer every moment  fuck everything  ,1
i m a quiet person that not good at socializing  the world reminds me everyday that i m not wanted  i keep thinking about my life and it s experiences  i have been the quiet kid turned into an equally quiet adult  throughout my life  i have been ostracized and excluded and hated for being quiet  i almost lost a job because of it  i am constantly courteous to everyone but it s not enough  it s daunting having to engage in mindless chatter   everyday  i m reminded about how entirely useless i am and i just want it to end  socially  i m inept and i don t want to live anymore  the reminders are too much  ,1

please  at least read the last few sentences this is a lot to read  so if you dont want to read it all  then please just read the last few sentences  you can even ignore the link     x   b   i dont know why i keep writing these  there must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times  having done everything right  putting up a good fight  only to submit to that dark desire  its not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain  we expect people to  not  cry out in pain most of the time  thats just how things are normally  its the chaotic pleas that catch our attention  because  its unexpected  yet  how many people have the strength  or desire  to tend to those that are suffering  if you ignore someone in pain  you take no responsibility for them unless youre personally called on  we only actively tend to others if there is a reward  or a heightened sense of sympathy     x   b   i find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide  but few do more than that  i dont think we should be babied  but it certainly feels like we get abandoned   its common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough  tend to a broken body until they are strong enough  raise a small child until they are strong enough  or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough  but not the emotionally damaged     x   b   so why do i keep writing these  desperation  probably  i know full well that  even under the banner of  suicide watch   most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair  taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them  im sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide  but what about those who did  how many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someones last words  will this be my final message to the world   like i said  i dont think most of us commit suicide  just  to die  we die as a last resort to end our suffering  at the same time  i dont think any of us live just to live  we  want  goals  passions  a sense of belonging  self worth  feelings of accomplishment  yet were told not to die because its  better  to live  even if that means living in misery     x   b   its at this point that i realize im only writing for myself  id  like  it if someone heard my cry for help  but im just another drop in the ocean  arent i   i dunno     x   b   i opened this with the intent on explaining why i feel suicidal   my   reason  https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments dyj z  ive been battling depression for nineteen years    but ive been repeating myself as it is online and offline     x   b   if someone  is  reading this  then thank you for at least hearing me out   if someone is reading this  im scared  im scared that i wont be able to hold this off anymore  so ill just imagine that im not alone  that maybe this message connects us   ill just pretend that someone is reading this  so  just in case i cant hold on  i wont be alone in the end   thank you  ,1
i told my mum  and she said exactly what i thought she would i told my mum i was suicidal  and she just keeps on bringing up the fact that there are people with worse situations than me  and that everyone would be sad about it  at least she says that well go to a therapist nvm  she doesnt want me going to a therapist   i hate this     edit  she told my dad and  he  says im judt being lazy edit    she doesnt think what im going through is a problem  then got mad at me  and said everyone goes through this  and then kept on saying i was too young  and that a child like me couldnt have depression  yeah  im still doing it on sunday  nvm  ,1
well guys  i m alive i stayed up the whole night last night going back and forth with my bottle of pills  i guess i won  ,1
imagine how pleasant it would be to sleep forever i dont want to die per say  but i also dont want to be alive  its too hard and im not cut out for it    the only place where i feel relief is when im asleep  when im asleep nothing bothers me  nothing can hurt me  i just wish it could be like that forever  ,1

i just wanna go to sleep  never wake up  and forever live in my fantasy world  ,1
i tried to hang myself  the belt broke  i stood on that chair for what felt like forever  some part of me was waiting for someone to come stop me  tell me how stupid i was and that my life was worth living  nobody stopped me  nobody cared  so i stepped off the chair  and felt the belt squeeze around my neck  i blacked out within a couple seconds  and what they say about  how everyone s final thoughts are that they wish they didn t do it  it s bullshit  my last thoughts were of relief  anyway  i woke up on the floor feeling woozy  and i didn t even remember i had just tried to kill myself  this is the closest i ve come to ending my own life  i just can t exist anymore  ,1
going to fight corona soon in a few hours my alarm will sound to wake me up for work  work in a hospital  diagnosing and treating corona patients  i wish i could sleep  i could really use some rest before the shift   but i am writing my suicide note and it is getting so long  i am writing about how i have been harassed and bullied by people i dont know  who attacked me and yelled at me on the street when i was only trying to go home  i want someone to know  and sympathize with me  but i have never told anyone except reddit  i must really be repulsive when i offend people whom i dont even know   noone would read my suicide note  i dont have a single friend  at    years of age i have never been in a relationship  i have no family  who would read this    ive written a suicide note every week for    years  but i just cant seem to end myself  i wish i could absorb the illnesses of my patients  like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die  maybe i would be remembered as a hero   i wish someone would read my note  but noone will  i have another meeting with corona in a few hours   edit  i am a transgender person  thats why people harass me  i suppose they think i am ugly and repulsive  i dont mind if you call me guy  they call me worse things but i wish i wasnt one  anyway thank you for the sympathetic replies  sorry  i dont know how to respond because it feels like noone can understand what it is like to feel like everyone hates you  i wish there were more of you out there instead of all these people who will hate you even though youre not hurting anyone  thank you for saying something nice to a stranger  ,1
my parents asked me to kill myself i have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out  so i reached out to my parents after a meltdown  its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues  i dont share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them  anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about  my own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y dont i do it if i really am depressed  great solution actually  now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally  maybe i wont be a liar anymore   maybe i can finally find peace ,1
i think my depression is passing im not sad all the time anymore  my suicidal thoughts have gone  no more urges to cut  my psychosis is kind to me  homocidal ideation is gone  i feel great  happy im making it through one of the hardest times of my life  ,1
i jumped off a  small  bridge surprise  i lived  the water was quite a bit deeper than i thought  and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface  i went headfirst  so any debri would have likely killed me outright  or knocked me out and caused me to drawn    i still got a concussion just from the water  fyi  concussions suck  do not recommend   and after i somehow managed to not drown anyway  i swam to shore  holy crap was it a long  cold walk home    believe it or not  i didn t think it was that big a deal  it didn t really feel like a true suicide attempt  more like it blurred the lines between  self harm  and  suicide   before the jump i had figured a      chance i d live if the water was deep  i was gambling a lot on that  if      when i got home i told my family  thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin  maybe take the next day off  nope  not a chance  we went  straight  to the er  then i was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit    the psych ward  i was pretty terrified  i didn t think i was worthy of such care  my issues were mild  weren t they  it was just  extreme  self harm    i spent five days in the hospital  and frankly they were some of the most incredible days i ve ever experienced in my life  i dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria  at several points  i  was  the hysterical  crying  inconsolable woman who you d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket    but they didn t do that to me  they talked to me  and they helped me  they gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself  somehow  they got me to admit that i  wanted  to live  even though i desperately believed i didn t deserve to  i m trying to remember  every minute of every day  that i  do  deserve to live    anyway    that s kinda my little story    tl dr  jumped off a bridge  landed in a psych ward  got legit help   edit  wow thanks for the support everyone  i ll try to answer your questions in more detail when i get a chance   edit    this got a bit more attention than i thought  but i m glad  if this enourages even one person to consider asking for help  or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program  i ll be overjoyed  ,1
waking up is   oh please not again  then waiting till it s dark again  repeat   ,1
my post here had not a single like or comment  i feel so alone  i guess i really am the only one out there dealing with this never ending crap  people always say youre never alone  but they dont know what its like to be me  ,1
why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isnt that great for some people  some people just get completely  utterly screwed  traumatized and limited by life  to the point that living just isnt enjoyable anymore  to the point that any wild eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no   sometimes even if there was a will  theres wasnt much of any way  and even if there still is  its not worth finding   ive seen people say they cant even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed  on the flip side  its hard for me to imagine what itd be like to not feel depression as thats been most of my life  with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off  those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere  i dont care  because they dont even look like ways out anymore  im at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldnt make me happy   but guess what the worst thing of all is  you have a  survival instinct   living another day feels awful  but dying is still terrifying  and beyond that its drummed into your head that youll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all  you dont even want to die  just for your reality to be fundamentally different  but thats obviously not how this all works   so  youre stuck in this hell thats been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building  and theres no grand purpose to it   theres no big meaning or reward for suffering through it   you just had really bad luck  you just happened to be the organism born to become self aware within an absolutely shitty situation  to the point many people  objectively admit you were  and now youve got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible  but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends   the thing is  too  i bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal  or god forbid  happy  to experience this feeling for a day  theyd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful theyve never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide   so  fuck it  ,1
i just called the hotline and got hung up on  talk about feeling alone he answered and said his name  i said hello kevin  how are you  he asked how i was i said  okay  i m very sad  and i got the dial tone  thank you very much  kevin  ,1
why does living with depression just feel like a series of necessary distractions  every single damn day i have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that i want to die    i dont want to hurt   i dont want to suffer  i dont want to take anyone with me in the process   i dont want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury    i dont want to hurt the ones who care about me  either   like my parents  i love them     but i am just so damn tired of living   it would be so nice if i could just fall asleep and not wake up     how nice it must be to not have depression  to not want to die   i cant imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self    ,1
does anyone else feel destined to die by suicide  it sounds emo and cringy as hell  but ive felt this way for   years  meh ,1
i tried to kill myself  not today  not yesterday    years ago  no one knows  no one noticed  i took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around  adderal  percocet  sleeping pills  and allergy meds were among them  i don t know what else  there were more than four bottles  it was just whatever i could find  i swallowed some of each  chasing them with a wine cooler  let a few dissolve on my tongue because i liked the sickening feeling they induced  i thought that would be enough  after a few minutes of nothing happening  i swallowed more  got dizzy  struggled to make it to the couch  passed out  i was passed out in the living room and my family didn t notice  they walked by me and didn t notice  i still remember it all vividly and think of it often  i had no regrets  i wanted to die  waking up  realizing i was still alive  that was the worst feeling i ve ever felt  it put me in a daze  i ve felt on pause ever since  i often regret not dying  i feel like i should be dead  i feel like a large part of me did die that day  the only reason i didn t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying  i knew i couldn t go through that again and didn t have other resources i felt were adequate  i dropped out of school shortly after  i stopped leaving my house  i see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it  i don t have that  life hasn t gotten better  i just wanted to tell someone  ,1
i almost died yesterday i almost did it yesterday  i skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and i planned to end my life  i tied the noose and i jumped from a tree  miraculously my neck didn t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down  in that second that i was hanging from the tree all i could think about was how much of a mistake it was  i spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and i realized that life has its ups and downs but that s what life is  you gotta live through the pain because it s all experiences  not good or bad experiences  just experiences  thank you  mike  if you are reading this   ,1
killing myself on jan  st      my parents found out i have depression  now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach  my mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself  she wouldnt care she said  so i was deeply hurt  i recently purchased a rope   hours ago online  im planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex boyfriend who i always loved  my friend who i drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me  my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better  which vainly failed  and of course  my dad  i love my dad very much  i already wrote a will   months ago  i told my classmates about my plan  and they all tried their best to make me feel better  i love them so much  but if i have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom    i just cant       x   b   honestly  fuck          x   b   edit              thank you for the people who showed concern  it made me rethink if i want to go through it or not  i just feel this way because everyday feels like hell and why even bother going on if everyone around you  including your old friends are happy  ,1
sick of hearing  it gets better  i don t care     i m not only suicidal for my  temporary  problems  i find life in general as simply meaningless and pointless  even if things got better i wouldn t want to live on this shitty planet  we all die in the end anyway  and my chronic pain isn t gonna get better ever  i don t want to change the world and i don t care if people have it worse  so stop trying to guilt me  ,1
im still here      was filled with   suicide attempts and   hospitalizations  im pretty sure i spent almost all of my year wishing i was dead  despite this  im getting better  im finally on meds  ive reconnected with old friends  and became much more social  there are some days where i feel like giving up  but i know im stronger than my thoughts  im managing  i hope you are too  please stay safe  ,1
i dont eat or sleep anymore and i hope itll kill me  as of writing this i have not slept for aprox    to    hours  have consumed no nutrition or water besides miniscule amounts that my primal instincts demanded of me  but i resist and have not eaten for    hours i believe   and while as the pathetic worthless low value man i am  i can not even commit the simple heroic act of removing my inferior genes from the genepool through efficent means  to blow your brains out  jump in front of a train  burn yourself  i couldve chosen so many ways     x   b   but here i am now hoping to perish  eventually my body has to determine it has to shut down hopefully completely  i dont feel any pain from it anymore  in fact i feel nothing slowly becoming a husk   i can still think clearly  in fact that is what i wish i couldnt  i can think so clearly that im hoping to die even more   while i write this feel all the futility of existence wrap around me  hugging me lovingly  more than a lover ever could  not that ive ever known what a lover will ever feel like ever in my life  or a hug in general that is  not even from a mother     x   b   not eating have saved a great deal of money  i used it on material goods that makes me forget the agony my body tries to remind me of  though slowly the dopamine will stop producing in my brain  it has already happened somewhat  my passions of creativity has no meaning anymore  theyre all just a symbolism of emposing death on myself in a vague form     x   b   leaving a legacy is the kind of thing a lot of people tend to think about when theyre decide to throw the match of chess with the reaper on purpose  it has been on mind all my life really  but not just a material or symbolic legacy but an actual physical one  a family to go on   but that is not to be  ive reached the point where its not possible  there is no hope now  and as i view even my material goods and symbols obscure into the black holes just like everyone elses i realize how little purpose there is in anything at all  i dont wanna be here anymore     x   b   and meanwhile as you skim over these useless words and symbols  it could be that i mightve finally went to sleep     x   b   hopefully to never wake up ever again     x   b   another decimal on a graph  ,1
i just want to die in my sleep   ,1
do you ever realize how easily you can exit someones life  its so strange  in under a year ive come to realize how easy it is to slip out of someones life no matter how much you cared for each other before  its comforting to think that these people will be  are   okay without me  so nothing will be  selfish  about my suicide   edit  thank you stranger for silver    to everyone else who understands this  every  you matter  and  you dont realize how much they care actually  is very kindhearted of you to say but untrue in my circumstance unfortunately  ,1
im lucky enough to have a few people in my life who care so much for me that sometimes it actually hurts  i dont want them to wake up one day to find me dead  even if right now i cant live for myself  i will try for them   ,1
life is a complete fucking joke  i dont understand why people think life matters  because it doesnt matter   ,1
ive become so accustomed to the fact that im going to kill myself that other peoples struggles with suicide dont register to me much because i think about it so much i just see them as another person like me  it also makes me feel like everyone is like me  so if i went to kill myself and people were around nobody would care  ,1
should i commit suicide  im a   yo male  my dad pressures me to get staight a s and if i don t he threatens me to beat the crap out of me  because of the pandemic my dad stays home all day and constantly watch me doing homework and hit me and yell at me  i would usually avoid him at school  now that my safe haven is closed i can t handle this anymore im considering ending it  also please leave tips for painless ways of suicide    sorry if my grammar is bad  english is my second language  ,1
i dont believe in god  but ive already came to the point where id pray to him every night that id get hit by a car and die or something  ,1
i wish i could give someone else my life some people are fighting to live   they are fighting death every day   it amaze me   wish i can appreciate being able to live but instead i wish to die as soon as possible ,1
i hate that you can t even mention suicidal thoughts because everyone will freak out even if you have them and know you won t act on them  i get in phases where every time something upsets me i have very graphic images of all the ways i could kill my self  my ocd urges it on  and my irrational side tries to tell me it s the best option  i have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option  though  even if i have doubts that i ll ever be  happy    but i can t say this to anyone because they ll freak out  they ll think they should call a hospital  or tell someone in my family  or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes  and all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside   edit  this is my first time posting here and i am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here  i hope to hear from more people  please pm me or  u  me in a comment if you re interested in talking about something in particular  like someone mentioned ocd and intrusive thoughts   ,1
if i could exchange my life with someone who needs it more  i would  i m failing  i m a huge disappointment  for all these years  i acted like i don t give a shit about everything  my parents are extremely carefree  living almost like teenagers the day they got an annulment when i was    i didn t grew up with any of them for my whole grade school and they ve staggered back into my life when i reach mid high school  i hate them  they made me feel like a burden  like an excess baggage  like i was holding them back to go on with whatever the fuck they wanted to do  i m sorry if you made a souvenir from you fucked up marriage  trust me i didn t want to be born either  i m sorry if you always see your ex spouse in my face and all of my mistakes  i m sorry that i looked like a splitting image between the two of you  i m sorry if i m not the daughter you hoped for  i m not academically smart  i failed my year  i couldn t tell you  i don t want to hear your judgement anymore  i already know how much of a waste i am    i ve made my decision since april  i gave myself a small deadline but it kept on extending because luckily schools still have a hard time reopening and i feel pretty shitty leaving the two most important people in my life  my best friends i don t want to die  i just don t want to exist anymore  so they don t have to grieve and feel like they could ve done something to save me but i really am just so tired  i can t tell anyone how i m feeling  whenever i opened up i ll get set aside  told to be strong or they say that they re for me when they re really not  i dunno why i decided to spill my emotional baggage to a bunch of strangers in the internet but it sucks when i m more comfortable opening up here than with my friends    it didn t help either that i m stuck      inside the house like most people are during quarantine but there had been riots outside and the government being a huge douchebag to it s citizens  i know i m being selfish when there are more important matters in the world right now  racism and discrimination  world hunger  poverty  abuse  people who have incurable diseases  i wonder why the world is such a harsh place  i know that life isn t fair but what the hell   if i could exchange my life with someone who needs it more  i would    i want people to know that i tried  i tried to ask for help  with my family  friends and even try seeking a counselor secretly because apparently  having a mental health problem is considered crazy  an attention seeker or being overly dramatic  my family told me to suck it up  i ll survive  life isn t fair  my friends told me they re there for me but my trust issues says no  suffer on your own  you don t want to burden them or overshare your sob story  my pride tells me to keep them in the dark with my troubles too because i ve been perceived as a fighter in our group  i m always the one who d they run to when they have a problem  in need of an advice or if there s a fight amongst us i m always in the neutral  i don t want them to see me so vulnerable like this  i reached out to my adviser and then a guidance counselor  i ve immediately been told that everything between us with be kept confidential unless they see certain signs and they d immediately tell it to the proper authorities  yeah  i ghosted him after that message    i wonder if those painkillers would really take effect if i swallowed it all  would it really kill my pain     june   th is my deadline  it sucks coz i m actually looking a bit forward to my   th birthday in july  th but i have to do it  i can t take anymore humiliation  suffering and disappointment  i m still a failure    lmao  sorry  i know i m being dramatic  i really am just tired and angry  i want to sleep  apologies for the terrible grammar too  english is not really my first language and i m sorry if this is too long and i wasted your time  ,1
im    years old  i will kill myself next week  i need help  i need to feel that somebody understands me  hi  for the people worrying  i have made a post with an update  i am so thankful for your support i love you all  https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments e  l a update im    years old i will kill myself next  utm medium android app utm source share  please trust me  i am trying to describe my feelings in this post for almost   hours now  i need to post this  i will edit this tomorrow and do a whole story i just need somebody to know this  i dont want to die  ,1
i don t want to get  help  no i don t want to get better  in fact i want to get worse  i want to get so bad that i have no choice but to kill myself  why would i want to get better if i want to die  getting  better  will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where i still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and i m sorry but that s the opposite of what i want  i don t want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that i should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades  death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life  medication and therapy might minimize it but it ll never truly go away  the longer i m alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do  ,1
my daughter    f  tried to kill herself last night to put it simply  i am so lost  this is the second time she has done something suicidal and i have tried my hardest to be there for her every step of the way  there are so many factors that go into this that i could type  on mobile  until my thumbs hurt  i am hurt  i don t know how to trust her  it sucks so bad i just want to be there for her and twice now i have been informed by second parties that this has happened  i found her in the garage last night after taking a handful of pills  she was scared said she thought she was a freak  i told her i loved her no matter what  i consoled sisters and called grandmas so i could meet her and her mom at the hospital   i told her i loved her  and now everything today is like normal  i am hurt  i am so hurt and i don t want to put that on her  but i am tiered of emotional pep talks  and it hurt to know everything i ve ever said to her didn t help  i m sorry for this thread  i m honestly overall just sorry  ,1
does anyone else think about suicide every few seconds  its constantly on my mind  it doesnt matter what im doing  if im at work  or home or outside  the thoughts are always there  im talking about literally every       seconds i think about killing myself  ,1
i wished a truck could hit me unexpectedly  seriously wishing for this every day or some other accident would be fine as long as i end up dead   ,1
im afraid one day ill just snap and kill myself to be honest every time im angry or sad my mind goes to suicide  even the smallest things  an argument  missing the bus  anything  and im just scared one day ill get so mad or sad ill kill myself  its been like this for a year or two  but it keeps getting worse  im just so scared  i feel bad because other people have it worse then i do  but im just whining and afraid  a friend told me  other peoples worse problems dont mean youre problems arent bad  but im just so scared ,1
i died yesterday i died yesterday and now for some reason my body is moving but i m dead inside  yesterday was it  i m dead  i have nothing on the inside  no joy  no sorrow  no up  no down  no conversation  nothing  i am a body that s waiting for death whenever that may be because i m already dead  ,1
i ll never find my person and watching everyone around me find theirs is painful i want a best friend who can t wait to tell me good news  a so who can t wait to come home and spend time with me  it ll never happen  not everyone has a person and i m one of those people  i wish it wasn t so heartbreaking to see everyone around me enjoy life or at least not hate it to the point of suicidal ideation  a decade is a long time to be depressed and at this point it won t change  it s really shitty to spend my one life being me ,1
i fucking hate my birthday you dont give a shit about me the rest of the year why do you pretend to care about me now    every year its the same and every year its just a reminder that i havent killed myself yet ,1

i don t want to live without him it s been   years since my fiancé was murdered in a robbery gone bad and i wish i could say i m better but i m not  i ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left  i hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid  i was born to a family that doesn t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now i have to live the rest of my miserable life without him  i ve prayed for the courage to end it all  i ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse  the worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but i don t want anyone else  the thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick  i m not over my fiancé and i never will be  i think i was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress  i don t want to live with this pain anymore  i m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again  i will never marry or have a family  i will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren  my life is a waste and means nothing  i wish someone would shoot me in the head too   ,1
so let me get this straight   i have to do this for another     years  so let me get this straight  i never asked to be born  but i was    i was born in a shit city and grew up in shit neighborhoods  still here  still causing mental issues   i was born with serious mental issues that caused me to harm people when i was younger     never felt human at all or at least not for too long  could never ground myself and always fantasized about leaving for another world    ah  also unintelligent  going through school with poor grades  school fucked me up and causes my dreams to be themed around it nearly  every night   yet  people think i can make it through college    for some reason almost always irritable around family and tired of being constantly asked to do things  just want to be left alone    people have this romanticized view of me and contradict the truth that im evil and mean hearted and deserve death  no matter how determined i am and how much i build myself up  i cant escape it    pathetic  unless  unreliable  and a child in their mid twenties    pandemic has taught me how crazy it can drive you to be the house with people all the time  but i realize this just proves even more how mean i am    considering who and what i am  my family would be lying if they say they wouldnt be better off  who wouldnt reasonably trade not having to deal with that anymore  or even for something better    humanity cant seem to accept that some people really are not meant for this and a self inflicted death would be a positive  but theyd rather shame  guilt  belittle  patronize  and spite you into living   because that is the reasonable way to do it    ,1
please read this if you have the time  im really hoping somebody sees this  even if that seems selfish   maybe this isnt the right place for this  im new to this whole reddit thing  so i was pretty shocked when i found this subreddit  the world is pretty crazy these days  i guess  i have no clue how many people will see this  or if anyone will see it  but i just need a place to vent  so  heres a not so short summary of my entire life story   i was born at a very young age in korea to a woman and a man  who already had another child  my sister  in a crippling amount of debt  i moved to canada after a couple of years of living in korea  my fathers irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe   i was four when my mother hit me for the first time  i dont remember the particular instance  but it was then for sure  to me  it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose  any opportunity at all  she would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow  or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for  there have been far too many instances in my life so far  where i  an innocent child  has cowered at the hands of her mother  thinking it was the end  she has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts   i was in the third grade when i called my mom a bitch for the first and last time  i just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me  and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister  i muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day  she called the school i was attending at the time and told them i was  sick   she kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand  aiming for my head  my throat  and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow  this went on until my barely present father came home from work  i was sent to school the next day  being given a kiss before i left as if the day before had never happened   my school performance was never awful  in fact  it was more the opposite  i was considered somewhat of a child prodigy  school was the one place i felt i could truly thrive  if ever  i did have what i would consider seriously awful behaviour in school  as i would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother  this was not brought to anybodys attention  so for a very long time  which means it was not corrected until much later in my life   the  abusive   cycle kept going the way it was  with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline  and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day  with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face  i remember being in the fourth grade  sick of being  disciplined   i picked up our landline and looked her in the eye    im going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me   and she said  go ahead  nobody is going to help you   i felt completely defeated  there was no help for me  there was no escape  even at the tender age of    i started to feel as if there was no escape but death  i felt as if i couldnt talk to anyone about this  mom would probably hit me again  dad is never home   i know she wouldnt get it  i knew that if i talked about it at school  that legal troubles were sure to ensue  so i kept my mouth shut for a long time   another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade  when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere  we were at the pool  she seemed to be completely fine just moments before  but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall  telling me to get her help over and over again  and i didnt  call me a heathen  i stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone  she didnt  some days i still wish that she did   fast forward just a little more  there i was  a tender     resentful and bitter at the world  i didnt give a shit about anything  i just wanted it to be over  my school performance started to slip  i just couldnt understand like i could before  anything and everything was insanely distracting  and i took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world  somehow  my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark  and i was still considered a prodigy  despite my near fail scores  i couldnt do math to save my life  but because of the way i was treated  i would chant to myself at least im smart to make me feel better about it all  i was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high  which only further inflated my ego   when i got to my brand new school  i realized a couple of things     years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable     i had extreme trust issues     i was fucking stupid compared to my peers  i so badly wanted junior high to be my break  my way out  i wanted so badly for everything to get better  but i couldnt make any new friends  probably because i was terrifying  were talking descriptive death threats left and right  and my academics were not improving at all  focusing was near impossible  i couldnt ever shut my mouth  everyone hated me  i was at an all time low  and i still didnt have a single soul to tell this to  i couldnt trust those kids at school  theyd hand me over to the police like i was nothing  i never wanted that  i desperately wanted to put my past behind me  my mom had stopped beating me  only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than i was  but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment  i was living on edge at home and school  i managed to raise myself a little  teaching myself to trust little by little  teaching myself what was morally acceptable  anything to make me even one friend   eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze  i had friends  and people seemed to no longer think i was terrifying  but of course  in a cruel world such as this  nothing can ever be completely good  my grades were slipping hard  i procrastinated to the end of my life  and every assignment i handed in was complete shit  things didnt really improve family wise either  my mom would be pissed at me if i was sick and bedridden  since thats an inconvenience to her  my dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother  definitely not ideal  but i would fight my way through it  look at what i had already overcome   ninth grade  shit  i realized that people didnt actually like me  to everyone  i was just a background character  nothing more than a forgettable nobody  i felt invisible  like i was talking and people just didnt even care that i was there  this is also the year i was diagnosed with adhd  family didnt take it well  or rather they just didnt take it  none of them have really bothered to look into adhd at all  nobody asked the doctor any questions  none  zip  nada  my parents dont give a damn  theyve made no means to learn about it  they just pump me full of whats essentially meth as medication and hope i shut the fuck up  they dont reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance  nothing  its awful knowing that because of this  ill never be normal  nevertheless  i kept working towards self improvement  i was making good progress  i really thought i had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past   nope  quarantine  im stuck at home with my family  my mom has definitely calmed down  but i know that deep down she resents me  now  my sister is my biggest enemy  she truly is my second mother  she belittles me constantly  insulting me and disregarding me  worst of all  she pretends shes a fucking saint  just like my mother  when i confront her about the things she does  all i get is a   no i dont  i dont have any idea what youre talking about   and then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like were best friends  as if she didnt call me a defective retard the other day   and here i am now  washed up at     unable to recover from my past  broken forever  defective  stupid  unmotivated  invisible to the world  i want to end it all  i have nothing to lose  i am nothing  i purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because i didnt want people to think i was a  sad girl  or just a typical teenager  the more i read this though  the more im starting to think i am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded  my feelings are invalid  i hate myself   if anyone is really out here  and im not completely invisible  please say something  i dont want to be alone anymore  i dont think i can do this anymore  i dont want to be alone anymore  please  ,1
i killed my girlfriend  and now i want to kill myself      before you read my true story  i want you to know that im not very good at english  as its my second language so bare with me if i have made grammatical mistakes or anything  and honestly i really havent opened up about this incident in my life  until today   anyway   this one random late night in march       i decided to download the tinder app  probably the worst decisions in my life    but im genuinely a introvert person  so its hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people  most people hop on tinder to troll  some to get laid but i was on it to find  true love   fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or i was to boring to form a conversation  this one random day i got super liked by this girl named laura  we both started to talk  we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally   miles away from my place  it had been   weeks  we both still havent meet but our conversations started to get more personal  and i felt a real connection between us two  we both replied long  it used to take me a good   mins to an hour to reply  it was just how it was  it was however odd for me that she was really beautiful  and i was a ugly mf  she came from a small town family  where as me  i was a city kid  from a wealthy family  although she didnt know that for along time    after the   weeks of talking  we both decided to meet up for lunch  like when i say she was simple  she had no idea about brands or anything  i dressed up with some yeezy    s  she didnt even know them  and some part of me liked that she was like that  because most of the times  i only wore to show off  to feel rich  to feel accepted  one thing about being rich is that  the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say  like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house  a nice car  nice gadgets and all but its different being born wealthy  like i had everything that anyone would aspire of having  its different when you have everything  anyway that just made me like laura more because she was a simple person  a bit mysterious and i was always curious to know more about her   we ended up dating for   months  and i knew she was the one for me  she was beautiful  she loved me for who i was  i didnt have to pretend to be this cool dude like i did with my friends  she loved the sensitive little bitch i was  everything was going well  till  jan       she called and cried  her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage  the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months  laura was going through some tough times  but i was always with her  trying to make her strong  she would tell me stories about her dad  like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands  and how he would work    hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had  tbh that got me so depressed  like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all  but no matter what had happened over the next few months  years or the next decade or so  i said to myself that i would always be with laura  and i wanted to marry her   we got back to our casual routines  she was getting better and better  and on her birthday   th of march  i proposed to her  i honestly didnt know if it was the right time or not  but i felt like i needed to tell her that im gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her  laura said yes  cried and hugged so hard that i thought she would break my bones  but i knew that this meant a lot to her   april   th        this part is going to be hard for me  as i am typing my fingers are twitching  im really scared  because to say it out is something i havent done    anyway  on this very day  i picked up laura  we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad  we went on the highway  till this high speeding car  prolly doing    kmph  tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car  but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back  causing me to smash into the car  after this moment  i dont remember a thing  it felt like i died  i could hear my surroundings but i couldnt see anything  idk how long or anything i woke up and the first thing i asked was  what happened to laura   and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me  i kept asking  and no one replied  then it hit me  it hit me that shes not alive  and i couldnt understand  it all happened in a flash of a second   the love of my life was gone  and i could do nothing about it  i didnt know how to take it in  it fucked me up  i only had minor injuries  but i was mentally dead   fast forward to a month  i still was in shock  infact i still am   i went to visit her family  to apologies  but couldnt even let out a word  just cried out loud  but somehow they understood my pain  lauras dad seemed to be weaker  her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad  she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse  a week later  i found out that lauras dad had passed away  i wasnt ready for the funeral  i didnt go to lauras too because i couldnt accept it but my mum told me that i had to go to comfort her mum  but lauras mum had completely changed  she didnt want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and i honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her   fast forward it to now  there hasnt been a day i felt that i could have done better  i could have reacted better  and if i had turned the other way  maybe i could have died instead of laura  maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time  maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer  maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around  i know its not my fault  ive heard people say that constantly  its not fault bro  but i could have done better  to prevent it  and that is stuck in my mind  and always will  i honestly have no hope for life  i just want to die  i cant get over these thoughts  i just hope i die real soon     its not that i want sympathy but i just cant deal with it  it hurts  ,1
the amount of people suffering here is insane do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general  the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature    which we pretend to care about and try to  help  them if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering they know how hug your scars are but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering people understemate how severe your depression actually is people say go get therapy  take anti depressiants but its not a      cure it never cured everyone  i myself took pills but it never worked   actually depression and other disorders never had a magical cure like we have on flu   yet we dont take it seriously  and the result  suicide  i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine but no    its like a curse   once you get it its gonna never stop hurting you only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it    maybe its like a snake    eats you from the inside out first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things  and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body    it will make you wish for death and later on plan it this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events and deep scars left unhealed   and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care   love and good treatment not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit   i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder    if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care we wouldnt ever get to this point that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more   everything bad happens to us is what we deserve  we all cold and greedy we all just take take and take we never give we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant we all deserve to die  no one is good if there is good left in us its only minor god if you even exist please end us already please end me   i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever the hell is in me and in the world i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world the best i could do is just die  edit   one day and this many upvotes  well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me   wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck  thanks for you all     you all are my shining hope in this darkness    im lost here and trying to find my way out of here    well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world ,1

it sucks so bad when you have a bunch of great days in a row  and you feel like you re making a ton of progression on your mental health and outlook and life in general  then   bad thing happens and you re back to feeling worthless  ,1

 but you are so attractive you have no reason to have social anxiety and depression   i know its not the correct sub but why the hell do so many fuckheads say that shit     yes i have a mirror   yes i care about my hygiene and looks because i learned it that way and its hard to dislearn something like eating with a fork and knife   yes i hit the gym every other day   but why the fuck does that have something to do with my mental health   im a male and its already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure  at least in germany  but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on     x   b   has anyone ever encountered shit like that  ,1

i want to kill myself  i want to die  nsfw   trigger warning   talk of sexual and physical abuse there is no tl dr  i need to vent  ive never told anyone the entirety of my life  i never wrote down how i felt  i want to see if it helps       x   b   i was physically abused by my father  i remember one time he slammed pushed the kitchen table into my chest while i was eating dinner  it pressed my chair up against the wall  then pushed all the air out of my chest  i remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp  as the table was pulled away   when i tried to get up  while on hands and knees  i was kicked in my stomach by him  i dont remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my   brothers  i was    this is one story     x   b   my great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity  until i was in my   s i was reminded daily about how worthless i was over something i had no control over  he basically stepped in as the father figure  i would spend my summers in southern california helping him super his apartments until i was about        x   b   i have never told anyone this  i was also sexual abused     x   b   i have never told anyone this  i was raped     x   b   to me  those are two separate things  when the abuse started  i physically enjoyed it  had no idea  then i was brutally sodomized  then i grew up just a little and thats when i started to hate distrust and not like anyone  i built a fake smile  i built an auto pilot response for everyday things  i dont think  when i can  i do what i can to stop     x   b   from the ages of    to about    i was fucking raped weekly by a boy   years older well call the fat ugly rapist fmc   i felt like shit because at the start i liked it  i didnt know what was happening to me  i just felt  by the time i was     i started to feel disgusted  by     i fucking hated everyone  i dont care to discuss the last time he abused me but i will say i dont think he ever put himself in the position he was in  he left me alone at that point   by the time i was     i was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people i went to school with  gang related and they didnt want to get in trouble  and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if i get caught  i was a minor   they all deserved   this is just how i felt at the time   it and it was my only outlet  it was shit like  kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school  or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend  shit like like that  the last time i did something like this for example   some kid who was a senior   over    at the time  had his stereo stolen  he gave me     to beat the shit out of the kid who did it     yo    he reminded me of the boy who raped me  when i punched that kid  all i could see was that fat piece of shit fmc  when he was on the ground  in the fencing position  i drug and slammed him around by is hair  into the side walk  i picked him off the ground  while he was dead weight  and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence  i was expelled and arrested for assault  i tested out of high school  i have never ever been violent with anyone since then  all the way till now and im      during my time in school  seventh through high school  i hated everyone  fuck em  i had only   real friend and i had one crush on a girl  one  it lasted no less than   weeks of fantasizing before fmc learned about it  he didnt like it  he told david my best friend at the time  he had no idea fmc was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family  that i had made out with her  he knew david liked her  david  pissed from hearing this  asked christian  of course she denied it  it never happened  it wasnt true  i was now known as a liar  she went to church and school with me  i was    at the time  so from grade school right on through to high school  if i went to church with you or school  i was a liar  so the one girl ive ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar  my best friend  no longer  because now im a liar  this was what happened the first time i ever told another person i had feelings twards someone else  one little bitty crush  now   no social life  destroyed  home life also  behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell  i liked girls  was being raped by a    lb  fat fucking boy  i hated fmc  after my last altercation with him i was close to or at     about a year goes by  no girls look at me  small town  i dont like them  because they hate me  i lie about making out with em  i wanted to have sex though  to be clear  i wanted to fuck  i had been fucked  i wanted to have joy    just once    so i had a plan  when i was around     doing the summer super job for my grandfather  i paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because i wanted to know what sex was like with a woman  when i got back to northern california after the summer job at gramps  i told my older brother and he called me a liar  i never told him anything personal up until recently because of that  now my family thinks im a liar  and hates me to     x   b   so at this point i am    and i fucking hate everyone  my dad also starts developing a mental disorder  he slowly is becoming mentally disabled  i figured  fuck him  some karma     x   b   i decide to move out  my cousin  she moves in with me  i was growing weed at the time  played video games  didnt think   she and i connected  she was the first person i ever felt any affection for  she didnt want to use me  she didnt want hurt me  she wanted to know why i was hurt  my head at this point of my life is just so fucked i think confuse that with her romantically liking me  i did my best to sleep with her  she out of guilt  w e let me  she knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together   i knew her from the age of      then met her again when she was     i  out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the only person i actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w e my cousin into an incestuous relationship  i wanted to kill myself  i kicked her out of the apt  she moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about   years  i felt i was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that     x   b   i was going to kill myself     x   b   my grandmother  the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis  she was a chef  so i learned to cook and take care of her  i learned that i enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking  this was the first time i felt any joy from someone else  people  my grandmother died when i was around     she killed her self  the pain was to much  i hate saying this but  i didnt really care  i love her    but i didnt care  at least she wasnt in pain        x   b   i felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time  no love  no hate     x   b   so until about the age of     i got hit on multiple times  i am not unattractive i guess  i was in   physical relationships in my twenties    i sorta developed feelings for  i never asked any of them out  i never once told them i loved them  i never lied to them or cheated  they asked me out  they persude me   sex was a chore  i love sex in my head  i love to  masturbate   watch a healthy amount of porn  but actually having sex      ugh  i would rather  masturbate  tbh  everything sex reminded me of two things  the only person i care for and still love like a sister now  my cousin  which makes me sick to my stomach because i felt i manipulated her into doing something horrible  and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit   with porn at least i can choose any nice loving thing that i want  i like scenes where you can tell there really into each other     and i dont have to think       at    i was in love for the first time   met her at work     x   b   she started everything  i mean everything  she broke up with her boyfriend at work  asked me out in front of him the next week  for   months she was in a relationship with me  for   months i thought we were together  for   months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than   years at this point  used me to further his cuckold fantasy  when i found him literally in the closet one night in my fucking apartment that she snuck him into that day at what time i dont fucking know  jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who i thought was with me  i flipped out  my life is insane  wtf is this shit  melony thought i was going to kill them  i mightve  she left  both naked  with my blanket  peeling out of the parking lot  i quit that job the next day     x   b   i want to kill myself  have it planned     x   b   my father develops a bad health issue  compounded with his now mental age of around    his health his slipping  fast     x   b   i move in with him  the state pays for me to take care of him  i do nothing but play video games and smoke weed  im waiting  i tell myself   when he dies  i go to      x   b   at     i leave the house maybe once a month  my older brother decides he wants to reach out cause im a  little  closed off  at the age of    he includes me in his hobby  at     i turned it into what might now be a carrier  i still take care of my father  i am not so sad anymore     x   b   im     im doing well at the job i can make into a career  i met someone  another co worker  and for the first time  no confusion  i have a full blown crush as an adult  shes nothing special to look at  not ugly in any way  but my god the personality  her choice in music  so many things in common  thinking about her makes me smile  she initiated the flirting  we chatted for hours and hours for weeks  this did not happen over night  she has been there for   months at this point  and about   attached at my hip when she had free time  also the subjects she would bring up  she was very much flirting  so of course i tell her  no way can i have any regrets     x   b   so today i come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door  witch is not normal  i ask her if i can talk to her about something later at lunch  we get ice cream some times together so i figured that would be the time  she just avoided and left me standing there after i asked if we could talk later  didnt answer  so i asked her at the end of the day  told her how i felt  and the last thing that i wanted was for her to feel weird at work   then she told me she has some one  and its  complicated   i am almost positive  she likes another coworker  i see them text each other all the time  didnt think anything of it till today  the thing is  yesterday i mentioned i might ask her out the next day joking around when i seen the other co worker in the parking lot  the one i think she likes  he doesnt work in the building with us  hadnt seen or talked to him at all today  he laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out  pretty sure he told her the day before  it made so much sense after i thought about it  the way she avoided me     x   b   she wants nothing to do with me  went from conversations  her staring at me when she thought i wasnt looking  to her actively avoiding me at work  in just one day  i went from feeling again  i went from finally feeling like i can open up to someone  i even entertained being normal once  i felt again for someone else once more  this time it wasnt misplaced i told myself  i should have listened to myself when i told me not to even think like that  because it wont happen  it wont  never in my life will i ever find someone that wants me for me  not to use me  never in my life will i want the person that does  i will not be happy   all i want for my coworker is to be happy  i dont think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious  i think its just terrible timing  or this is hell     x   b   i think im done  thinking about headed to sleep   i will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything    all i know is  i got to feel for once  and what i felt was what people do normally  i couldnt even once in my life have one thing one fucking thing normal  i cant be happy i guess  fuck this world   update  i made it home from work  while i was at work i felt comfortable enough to talk a little to a co   worker  gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than i thought it would be  he helped just by listening  that being said  she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness  didnt have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didnt have to leave together  i just want her to feel comfortable at work  its not her fault at all  also everyone at work knows  everyone including both my bosses thought the same as i did about my co workers interest in me  one even asked the girl i liked i guess   how long do you think it will take before you two hook up    so i guess my mind wasnt playing tricks on me  just wish she didnt play games  all i know is i cant choose how i feel and i bet shes no different  so i am just going to be myself for right now  do what i do  dont think  just do  but fuck  im still so fucking tired of being nothing  feeling nothing  at least today i felt like shit    i mean  that at least is something        another thing i will add is my older brother and i have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his   ,1
nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world if you start getting depressed or lash out  first thing theyll think of you is you are dangerous  theyll look for a solution in mental institutions  medicine  restraining   anything to keep you from doing harm    theyll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts  to them  you should suffer in silence and never exist   the stories in the movies  books  etc  are all wrong  humans are selfish  first and foremost  jesus does not exist in real life  and no  he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments  nobody will  thats why its just a myth   to them  youre just an animal  a human turned into a zombie  that needs to be taken out  your emotions arent valid responses to your environment  to them  you are broken  ,1

i quit  i quit    i can t do this anymore  the world has gone to shit  my life is a mess  i can t keep going anymore    i have no career prospects  no skills  no savings  no real home  no hobbies  no friends  there s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life  nothing to plan or to hope for  i m not going anywhere and i m sick of pretending that one day  somehow my hard work will pay off  because it never does and it never will  fuck it all    my partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive  and swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed  no in between  she completely sabotages everything i try to do for myself because she s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order i try to make for myself    i hate my shitty life  i hate the cunts i have to sit on the phone and  play nice with  selling shit they don t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage  i am rejected from every  good  job filtered and processed by ai i and pretend i want just so i can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid  save  i looked at my cv the other day and i might as well have said   fuck me up the arse for money  and i would have had better offers  at least then i wouldn t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally  physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas  at least i wouldn t be so fucking surprised   everyday of my life is just one big joke  i put one foot forward and it s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit  constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next  pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes   i m ugly  i m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all  everything i love fucks up in the end and i hate where it s gotten me  the vapid swirling vortex of fuck all  the purgatory of wearing this fucking mask  pushing boulders  breaking my back  tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful  grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn t even know i m alive    then there s the fucking world going to fuckkery    honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if i carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass  why bother  pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit  even if that should somehow be solved within the next     months  the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return  waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them  the ice caps to melt  the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or  at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned  picking our way through the mess for scraps   fuck me  even if the world doesn t fuck us up  the socio economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight  police and totalitarianism on the horizon  double speak  riots  food shortages  poverty  fake news  social unrest  the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees   i don t even feel good about having kids anymore    what s the point  their lives will probably be worse off than my own  maybe they too will bemoan and rue my  millennial  generation for their selfish  narsasstic  self titled  irony   maybe they ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word  selfie  and social media that harvests their data for shady governments  maybe they can overlook the fact that i cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because i simply can t make enough    what will i tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me  what did you do to stop all of this      what will i say   oh yes darling i know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world  isn t that great    and then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly   so what s the point    honestly  can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point  i know it doesn t get better or easier  i know that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another  i know that none of this can get any better for me  i m ready to quit    i have some beta blockers and a beer  i don t want to sit around and wait anymore    i can t do this  i can t hold on  i can t make it better  it just doesn t go that way for me and i hate it  i don t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore  i can t  everyday i am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds i have  who knows i ll probably fuck that up in the end too    edit update    hello dear gentle people who heard me and gave me such kindness when i was so low and lost    i am alive and yesterday morning i woke up  quit my shitty job and with the day finally to myself  i did something that i didn t actually ever consider i would do being dyslexic and generally very pessimistic    i wrote a short story    now it s probably just all purple prose and rambling and dog shit but i was so moved and inspired by all of your sweet remarks of my rants that for once in my miserable little life i believed in me  i finished something  i saw fit to try for once    my partner is still an absolute cunt and so completely far up her own arse she might be wearing herself as a hat  i believe now this is probably because of her addictions or her god awful personality that metronomes quickly from toxic  incompetent and dumb to victim mindset mired in lack  of the cursed sickness  melodram pathetism  and not ever changing    for the moment i m still with her  she s still emotionally distant and completely unself aware  i will see where this goes but i don t have a huge amount of hope for her  i have a separate bank account so might indeed save up to get my own place away from everyone including her  even as a temporary measure  i am acutely aware of how little time i have really had all to myself and how little control i have in my life and it has become very clear  almost painfully so  that if she doesn t care for me then i think she shall not fight for me    until that point  i want to write  i feel like i need to live for something and that my writing can help  if anyone has and tips or pointers for assistance for where and how i can share my work i would be eternally grateful    thank you all for helping me  and to all of those who reached out to me and found themselves in the same curled  gnarled words i put up here  i am only too sorry that there should be others that have to feel in that same way  which is probably much more saddening than my rant in itself really  that so many more like me feel that way  i m sorry you have also felt like this  i wish you all the very best and thank you again for your warmth and love    take care  ,1
i would give everything to be straight id give my soul to the devil to be straight  i wish i was straight more than anything  i want to die  i want to fucking kill myself and never breathe again    no one understands what its like to be gay  how shit  unfortunate and depression it really is  youre dating pool is nearly non existent so you most likely will never find someone  even if you do find someone you cannot ever create a real  traditional  biological family with them  before any of this  you have to deal with homophobia  realizing youre a worthless dissapointment to your parents  that you betrayed them    this is how i feel every single day of my worthless life  every single day  im sick of it  i want to kill myself  ,1
people say this feeling is temporary and it will pass  but i have never experienced sustained happiness  i have always been depressed   my entire life  it frustrates me that people think they have the right to morally press me into staying away from suicidal thought and faking enjoyment for life   i will not kill myself  because of the natural human fear of death  that doesn t mean i m happy to be here or that i ever have been     years of being depressed angry and fucked up and no it isn t ever going to get any better i fucking know it won t  i don t even want to live a happy lie   i fucking hate my selfish pathetic parents for putting me on this earth  i did not ask to participate in life  i did not consent to be effectively forced into wage slavery and then eventually the terrifying experience of death   off to get drunk now to blunt the sharpness of these feelings  edit  getting drunk was        the right decision i actually feel vaguely happy wtf is this magic ,1
i tried to hang myself and i m not handling it well yesterday i tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when i jumped i instantly regretted it  i fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail  but the belt was chocking me  i tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me  eventually my arms gave out and i started to dangle and suffocate  i saw people in my life that had died and i saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes  right as i was about to  go out  my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge  it was my last strength  i pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that i was parallel with the bridge  this gave me room to breath again  i swung my arm up and around the rail so that i could attempt to take the belt off and i knew i only had one shot at this  i was successful  but my body gave out after the belt was free and i dropped into the water  the next day  or today  i have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other ptsd symptoms and i m not sure how i can deal with it  anyone have anything that could help  ,1
can you be suicidal but not want to die  i m depressed and i self harm  but i don t want to die  i m scared to die and i have been happy in the past and i believe that one day  hopefully soon  i m going to feel better again    but at the same time  lately i ve caught myself thinking tricking myself into believing that i want to die   today i saw my grandmother and haven t hugged her for a while because of covid but i did today because i thought  well  soon i ll be gone so i should hug her one last time   i was sitting talking to some friends and felt really sad suddenly today because i  realised  that i ll  probably never see them again   holding my friend s baby      he ll never know me    and i ve been having intrusive thoughts whenever i m near anything that could be a suicide strategy   steep cliff  long rope  medications  sharp objects  train  fast traffic   you should        you could       why don t you       i know that i don t want to die  but i m scared of the thoughts i m having and i m scared i ll lose control and do something   i also don t want to hurt myself  but i do anyway because i can t control myself  cutting    recently started again after not doing it for     years    i m seeking help but everything takes time and i m scared that things are getting worse  ,1
high school  more specifically the people at it  makes me suicidal as f ck  whoever said high school is the best   years of your life is so full of shit  i have never met more fake  toxic  useless  worthless people than at my school  some of these people make it their life mission to make everyone around them as miserable as possible  just for a quick laugh out of their friend group  i legitimately fantasize about murdering some of these people almost daily  i know i would never follow through with these thoughts  but its still scary i even have them  fuck i really just want to off myself  but i cant do that to the people around me  could i just get hit by a car or get terminal cancer or something   why the hell am i even forced to go to school      i dont mean to sound like an intellectual or anything  but i have learned loads more useful stuff from just googling shit im curious about  than memorizing bullshit in a classroom  quarantine has been a dream come true  really  i never want this summer to end  every school year just gets worse and worse  itll be a miracle if i make it through the next   years  ,1

i almost killed myself but i didn t    yay  i guess   i almost drove off the cliff  i was so close to doing it  but i sat in my car and i screamed     just go home  just go home  just go home  just go home    until i made it home  and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed   when i went inside  i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath   the next day  my best friend took me out to eat  i told her i almost did it  and she said  i could tell a few days before that you were off  and i didn t say anything  i m sorry  i should have  i didn t want you to feel like i was smothering you     but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it    i have a great support system  but i m just living with this mental illness  it hurts  my life is so good  but i m just sick  ,1

depression ruined my personality and my mind edit  if you see this please switch to the  new  filter on the sw homepage and refresh  and comment on those latest posts  you might just be the help they need  thank you everyone for reaching out and making me feel less alone  i m overwhelmed by all the positive responses  i guess not all people are malicious after all  keep spreading the love     depression made me dumb  uninteresting  made me stop reading books  made me stop learning  caused me to spend days like a zombie  caused me amnesia  literally caused my brain to shrink  but the worst was the effect it had after    years of fucking my brain  now i lost my mind  now i lost that quirky weird fun personality  now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be  i had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd  for being weird  for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and tv   then i grew up and i lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally  i wanted to be in the art community  going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings  contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy  i was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy  i was that guy  i was born to be that guy   but depression fucked me  and for the past   years i had set the goal to become that person again  the real me  but i have not only failed but i have rotten even further  depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on  otherwise theres no point in living like a half vegetable  high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night   i lost   women i truly loved due to my depression  due to them thinking that i was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker  only to find out i had nothing to talk about  i wasnt able to form arguments  wasnt able to debate on topics  hadnt read many books  didnt know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them  its my worst nightmare come true  people ditching and telling me im uninteresting  this was not supposed to be my life  i deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience  years of pain and sorrow  i persevered  i dont accept this anymore  i tried to change but it doesnt work  i cant read anymore  my brain is fucked and ive literally lost so many iq points that i dont understand what people tell me  my brain is too slow  and while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so i cant connect them and comprehend the story  i live in the moment  i can only hold   seconds of life in my mind  i lost my creativity  my ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed   oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other  she is my female version  i am her  and she is exactly the person i wanted to be  maybe thats why i love her so much  and as mad and hurt as i am for the way she treated me  i really cant blame her for not wanting me  i wouldnt want this  me  either  but it hurts so much because i know how i used to be  i know how my life would have turned out without the depression  its so fucking painful  a family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful  it was shocking but this daily constant pain  this living through my nightmares is unbearable     x   b   i have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die  i deserve my peace  this is not me  you can have my life  i dont want it anymore  i am in hell and i want this to end  ,1
have you ever been stuck in a cycle of  i want to live and give a big fuck you to people who kicked me when i was down   to  i want to kill myself to prove a point  to  nobody gives a shit about me enough for either of those things to happen   i am leaning far more towards the last two   ,1
depression has killed my brain literally   i cant learn or understand new things  i dont even understand basic and simple shit  its so fucking frustrating  especially when people call me out for the retarded shit that i do and i cant even understand that  i cant do anything anymore  my life is completely devoid of meaning   im thinking about dying  but i just dont know yet  ,1
im addicted to the idea of not existing anymore it makes me feel calm  it makes me remember that  eventually  it will all end  see  ive been thinking about suicide since i was        im    and this is part of me  im bipolar  i have so many demons inside my head  even with meds and therapy  sometimes its unbearable and then i start a travel inside my mind  where i think about the idea of not existing  i wont be here  the pain  the traumas  ill become just a memory   but i also have to leave the good things behind  like my favorite music  movie  my cats   it hurts  its like im running out of air for years  suicide is there  it is an option  the final one   at the end of the day i just want to quiet my mind  thats all i need     x   b   sorry  just needed to write about this   and i think this is a safe place   edit  im glad some people can relate to this  well be okay  eventually  one day this will all end and we wont need to use suicide as an exit  always remember that  ,1

best friend killed himself  i want to join him my best friend killed himself at the end of september  and i still cant handle it  im    f  and he was    m   he was the most amazing person i had ever known  and he told me once last june about his plans to commit suicide  i tried to support him  but he killed himself months afterwards  i know that  as i was at the time  i couldnt be the reason he would want to live  but it hurts so much that he left me  he was the only one who would or could help   i called him crying very late one night  when he had a test the next day at   a m   and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep  and aced it because he was a genius  how am i ever going to find a guy like him again  i loved him  but i never told him  and he died all alone  feeling like he was unloved   ive cried every night since he died  wishing i could join him in death  i cant feel anything for anyone else  he made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way i never thought was possible  now hes gone   forever  im such a failure  i failed him  i never made him feel like he made me feel  he used to put his hand on my cheek  and tell me that i was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him  now  i pretend my pillow is his hand as i cry myself to sleep   i failed him  i was insecure and had intimacy issues  and i never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world  he was everything  he had led such a hard and tragic life  but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for  including me  when i told him my father had sexually abused me  i expected him to run for the door  instead  he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what  and that i was still beautiful to him  im sobbing  remembering the unconditional love he gave me   i cant exist without him  i reach my arms out into the air sometimes when im trying to fall asleep  hoping i can feel his arms around me again  why didnt i tell him that i loved him  why did i assume i would see him again  i feel so guilty  i just want to feel his love again  and to smell him as he hugs me  he gave the best hugs in the world   i just want to die and be with him again  i want to tell him that i love him   shane   i love you  im so sorry you died alone  and that i wasnt there  im sorry you died feeling like no one loved you  because i do  if only i had shown you what was in my heart  maybe you would have stayed  im sorry  i love you with all of my heart  i know you wanted me to live  but i cant without you  you were the only one for me  but i was too stupid to let you in  ill see you soon  my love  which is the first time ive called you that     cassie ,1

why does every inconvenience trigger suicidal thoughts  yesterday  it was a bad surf session triggered by comparing my performance with others  today  it was because the waves were too big for me to ride  i told myself i was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf  it eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective  but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle  i want a technique to make it not start in the first place  i dont want to die right now  but i cant stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up  i hate myself when i feel sorry for myself  which results in this crazy internal struggle  which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up  any help will be appreciated  thanks  ,1
if i test positive  i m going to kill myself  i m getting tested on saturday  it s been a rough life  i cant finish highschool  my anxiety for testing for hiv is sky rocket  and i feel like a failure  nothing in my life is going my way and i m only     i havent been taking my meds  stupid i know  so i constantly worry about everything  and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof    i was sexually assaulted in june  he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone i trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me   i m more suicidal than ever  my anxiety is off the roof and i m scared to have sex again because i m afraid that my rapist gave me hiv  i will never live with myself and i can t tell my friends or the boy i m talking to  i have nobody  no support and i m afraid to go get tested on saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done   if the test results come out positive  it s the end for me bc nobody will love me and i m just a dirty worthless piece of shit  i wish i never existed  and i m in so much agony and pain and stress  my  then clear  face is breaking out and making me feel even worse   i don t know what to do and i m scared and i feel hopeless  i feel like death is my only way out   update         so today i found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant  and he already has a kid  so he has two kids now  my anxiety is a little calm now because i m sure if he had hiv they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother  she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is  but it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences  i could ve been that pregnant girl  i hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable std  but that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now i don t love it anymore  i m still disgusted by my body now and i feel dirty ashamed   i wish this would all end  i think i might kill myself soon  i can t focus on life rn when all of this is happening  ,1
never opening my mouth ever again any time i talk about myself or how i feel to people or reach out for help i always end up messing up and ruining their day or making them annoyed or angry or just disappointed    no more  i ll finally accept the approach where i pretend everything is perfectly great and nothing is wrong because keeping to myself is strides better than ruining someone else s mood  they don t deserve to deal with my bullshit and i don t deserve anyone s help and kindness ,1
i should have killed myself in high school i was a fool to think that things would change and that i would actually feel better when i reach college  i was so fucking wrong it s not even funny   life only gets worse from here  i don t want to be alive to see how it gets worse   if i had known i would still feel this way by the time i got to college i would have hung myself freshman year of high school ,1
who else feels like theyre only still living to spare the feelings of their family members  theres nothing in my life worth living for anymore  everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone  im disabled  in poor health  i suffer abuse on a daily basis and i feel totally alone in this world  it would be a relief to be able to just stop existing  the only thing preventing me is the fact that i have   or   family members who i feel would be deeply affected if i were to check out on them  so i suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings  anyone else in a similar situation  ,1
suicide is like a security blanket the thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever i feel like everything is going wrong  i could easily get rid of myself and i would no longer have to participate in this shit existence  i can t imagine actually growing old  i don t understand how others can magically plan out their lives while actually having real goals for themselves and not once think about harming or killing themselves  it s so foreign to me  ,1
alone we hug goodbye at the airport  you make your way to your boyfriend  waiting for you upstairs and i get into my cab  youre going home where youll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend    ill stumble into my house  lay my bags to one side so i dont trip over them then fall on to my bed  ill pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind  pretend its a hug  i wont think about tomorrow  how ill need to get up and clean the house somehow  i wont wonder if ill have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch    while your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip  ill turn on the tv because the silence kills me    its not that i resent that you have people  i just wish i wasnt so alone  i wish i didnt go back to an empty house all the time  i wish there was someone to say  welcome home   i wish that it isnt just google for me to talk to at home    when im sick  i become so vulnerable  broken body  broken spirit  the loneliness eats up at me even more and i wish i could smash everything around me  pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open  let it out  let out every thing inside of me  all my pains  watch as the pain flows out of my veins   i want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail  feel myself sway in the wind till i find the courage to let go  to fall to freedom  feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as i become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul  the wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain    i want to breathe it in  any gas that slowly seeps away my life  to feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me  well never wake again  the demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me  no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions    if i have to be alone tonight  i wish it could be for the last time   edit  thank you for the gold  kind stranger    and thank you everyone for your kind words  im glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too  ,1

anyone also getting suicidal thoughts when seeing happy stuff  kind of a question rather than a suicide post but i just needed to get this off my mind   so  whenever my friends send me cute stuff of their friends to them  or just happy cute things  i immediately think about killing myself  and im honestly not sure why  anyone else has them too  ,1

suicide is becoming a more and more attractive option each passing day  i don t know what to say except that  i m so fucking done  i m not going to do it and i don t plan to  but  even when i tell myself tomorrow is going to be a better day  it just isn t and killing myself seems more and more an actual option  ,1
fuck google it pisses me off that when i go searching for information on how to kill myself effectively and without pain all i get are half assed dont kill yourself pages  the internet used to be a source of knowledge and now its just a bunch of fucking brands and shameless self promoting content creators and seeing it makes me want to kill myself even more   my fucking mother called the cops on me for saying i had suicidal thoughts once  so no  obviously im not going to talk to you about literally anything  fuck you for making me exist without my consent   i miss my dead pet  i cant stop picturing her dead  and covered in her own shit   my fucking wife cheated on me  i read her emails  she was logged in on my pc  he straight up calls her a cunt and a fucking whore  thats who i got left for  im a fucking joke  ive been cheated on by everyone ive ever had a relationship with  she took out a credit card in my name and now im harassed every single day by people trying to get money from me  im in debt and i have no way out  she fucked this dude and now shes producer on his film  cant wait for that to come out  i feel like everyone is laughing at me  the manlet cuck who got btfo   i have intrusive thoughts about my genitals being mutilated all the time that cause me to physical wince  that is when im not literally spasming  probably from parkinsons which runs in my family  i say shit out loud unconsciously like   fucking kill myself  and  he killed himself   i jerk myself awake at least once every night   i cannot see anything getting better from here  it hurts every day and im filled with impotent rage  ive worked hard for so many years and i have nothing to show for it  and every day is worse than the last  my brain yearns for lead but this bullshit country wont even allow me the decency of a firearm to end this fucking charade  will probably use charcoal  ,1
going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day i feel so lonely because ive never found anyone else who feels the same way  i have depression and ever since the really really bad times ive never quite related to any other depressed person  for example fake smiling  never had to do that unless i was on the brink of tears at school  i genuinely felt happy but i was still depressed   most of the times i think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me  like when a friend unconsciously leave me out i think of suicide and i start tearing because of suicidal thoughts  just minor things  i can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and im emotionally unstable  or one day i can be sure i just want to die and the next i can feel like im on top of the world  i also mainly get depressed when im on my own and not with friends   anyone else feel like that  or is it just me   edit  didnt expect this to blow up  thanks for all the comments  i truly appreciate all of them  really  ,1
is being passively suicidal a thing  i m a    year old genderfluid person  and i feel what i think i can best describe as passively suicidal  i have no intention of directly killing myself  but i just don t have any will to go on  it s hard to articulate  but i feel kind of like if  for example  a car hit me and i was  say  bleeding out  i wouldn t call     and try to save myself  is this a thing  what should i do  ,1
anyone else badly want a relationship but know it s a terrible idea how could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable  some getting their thoughts out  some contemplating ending it  some already having decided and making their last remarks   i don t think life has a meaning but i do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me  the only times in the last   years i see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises  the feelings are different to those of friends of family for me  selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for    hours some days  don t respond to meds and are very unstable  one day having made plans to end your life  the nest cancelling them  being paralysed in bed another day  all those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us   so unfair and angering  everyone deserves love  especially those who are suffering and suicidal  i feel we deserve it the most but we can t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don t deserve it  i ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses  will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery  heartbreaking ,1
its a vicious cycle when you feel like your wasting your   s away but you dont have the will power to change it  when youd rather die than see yourself waste away your young life   ,1

do you guys fantasize about your suicide  i think about it a lot  like i imagine how itll play out    who would find me  the mess it would make  how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened  the process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through  my co workers finding out  how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming    do you guys go through the same thing  ,1
i want to die i want to die  i want to stop thinking  i want to stop hurting  i want to die   i just had to tell someone  anyone  because i can t tell anyone else    edit  i didn t expect this post to be so huge but appreciate everyone s response  help and stories  i kinda made it through the night and talked to my therapist  the thoughts are still there loudly as ever but i don t think i will commit suicide within the next days  thank you everyone for reaching out to me  i hope you guys find hope and something to make your day better  really  thank you a lot  reading all the comments and talking to some of you people helped me immense in distracting myself  i wish you the best   i m still here for anyone who wants to talk and wants to suffer together tho  please continue to help others in need ,1
does anyone else feel empty  all the time  i cant find anything that i enjoy doing anymore  everything just feels empty  i almost dont even feel human anymore  ,1
too cowardly to kill myself but too depressed to keep living this is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write  to establish things immediately  no i am not considering s    cide or am i in immediate danger  i would never do that to my mom  the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me   with that said  i think im just done with life  its been building for awhile and it just keeps building  it doesnt have much to do with the coronavirus or the riots but those have been the final straws  the coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends  try new activities or even do things i enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis  luckily workouts have resumed in my state so i can do that  the riots have taken away my love for sports and history  it seems like everything i love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces   even the activities i enjoy i dont enjoy as much as i used to  i feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that i now feel constantly   the coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become  god is definitely not in my life and i am angry at him for various things  that ill get into here in a minute   i am single and i have no kids or even pets to keep my company  while others at least had family to keep them company ive had no one  this coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me  most of my family live in another state and i would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick  plus my nieces wouldnt see me anyway  theyve bought into all the fear   i have failed so often at dating its become comical  i decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up  i went on a date on tuesday that i thought was going well  we played mini golf but then  according to her  her perfume started messing with her allergies  we didnt have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home  i contact her thursday where she tells me that shes been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes  needless to say i sent a nice little message to her  nothing rude but telling her i thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing i had no chance  like so many other times in my dating life i just felt used   besides being single with no kids or no pets i dont have a lot of friends  the few i do have know i struggle with depression at times and really do try to help  they all think im a very good guy whos just had bad luck and they truly believe im a good guy who deserves love and happiness  i just dont know if its in my cards at this point   besides that my body failed on me pretty early  im    but my body started failing on me around     always had high blood pressure that was hereditary  now im slightly overweight  have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma  i was on a flight to nashville back in         hour flight  where my throat really dried out  i started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up  no medical emergency but it was a horrible flight  now my doctor has me take a xanax     mg tablet before the flight to relax and a prednisone   mg tablet to control the asthma  its worked but whereas i used to love flying i now dread it  i feel like its destroyed my ability to travel  i dont want to fly for longer than a few hours  but theres so many places ive wanted to see  ive asked my doctor about it and ive asked a pulmonologist about it but they dont seem to take it seriously  i think they think its all mental for me at this point  ever since i became afraid to fly its destroyed me a piece at a time   so besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well  i know ive suffered from some anxiety like i mentioned but even my therapist wont officially diagnose me with depression  my mind is always half empty and i think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate   all in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation  that we get multiple chances at this life and that ill just get another chance  i know christian religions dont believe in reincarnation but its one of the few things that gives me hope  i will say this  i think god made a mistake having me be born during this time  i believe i was born in the wrong time   i have a job thats a good job but its ultimately a dead end job  ive never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion  ive always been adrift in terms of what i want to do  yes i have a bachelors degree with a double major in management and marketing  i also have my shrm certification as a certified hr professional  but if im honest i dont have a passion for any of it   so my personal life is a mess  my physical health s  cks  my mental health s  cks  i dont have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure  i feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one  the coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends  the riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence  they hate me just for being a white conservative male   i am a walking contradiction  i dont want to die and dont have to guts to but ive lost most of my will to live  ive wasted my youth  my best days are behind me and not in front of me and i no longer have any zest for life  deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore  sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but ive lost the ability to feel happy  ive lost the ability to connect with people  ive lost any ability to have empathy or compassion  i just feel like i dont care anymore   i dont know what im asking for out of this  i just had to finally get it out  i really dont know what to do at this point  if i could i really wish there was a  do over  button that we could press and start again  i wouldnt make all the mistakes ive made in my life  i would try to not be so da  n introverted when i was younger which made it hard to make friends  i wouldve traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition  i wouldve tried more activities to maybe find a passion   i dont anymore guys  it just all feels so hopeless  if i had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment i think thats the one i would use  hopeless   feel free to reply with what you want  im alone again on a saturday night anyway  ive got nowhere else to be and nothing better to do  ,1
i am not afraid of committing suicide i am not afraid of killing myself  but i think sam afraid to disappoint people who believed in my nd thought i am doing okay   but that wouldnt be the first time i disappoint people  ,1
my secret suicidal thoughts are getting worse  its getting harder to disobey  and i dont want to tell anyone im one of those super annoying people pleaser types  im constantly doing favors  listening to other peoples problems  and forever smiling and trying to keep the positive vibes going   im worse than just all that though  because im an airhead and i dont have good social skills  im always saying or doing something stupid  and it makes me more awkward  i act like its all good and im happy and it doesnt phase me  but that is so far from the truth    every single day im plagued by thoughts of how weak i am and how im annoying and how im a bitch and  i need to die  over and over and over  which turns into  i wanna kill myself  over and over  its getting worse every day  i dont expect help  i just needed a place to vent  ,1
its not depression  my life objectively sucks im     schizophrenic  probably autistic  cant get a diagnosis in ukraine   live with parents  still a virgin  we are poor  our apartment is falling apart  i used to make music  but not anymore because it gives me insomnia  a weird side effect of schizophrenia medication   my psychiatrist is uncooperative and nasty    i have to avoid anything exciting  like music   so i sleep    hours a day if i can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time  cant focus on tv or books  feel restless because of the pills  a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing   i cant live like this  ,1

suicide is a solution to a permanent problem i ll always be alone no matter what i try to do  rejection hurts far too much and i d rather be dead then have to experience it hundreds of times over and over again  i d rather die than have to live life forever alone  i don t give a shit if i m young  i d rather live a short life than live a long life of pain  misery and loneliness that only ends when i die of old age  i regret choosing not to kill myself in high school  the pain only persists and gets worse ,1
i wish my problems were normal teenager problems i want to be normal more than anything  i want to be grounded for sneaking out with friends instead of my parents desperately trying to make me get involved with other peers my age  i want to be tired because i stayed up late on my phone  not because i couldn t sleep due to trauma  i want to cry alone in my room because i m going through a bad breakup  not because i m planning my suicide  etc  i never feel like i can relate to other kids my age because our problems are completely different  it sounds bad but i d give anything to be like everyone else ,1
anyone else stuck with a permanent blank face with the only emotion being sadness and resentment   ,1
i hate this world so fucking much  everyone helps only those who least need it  the poor grow poorer and the rich get richer  fuck this   ,1
i just really wish i wouldnt wake up tomorrow morning  or any morning for that matter i just want to say to you all  thank you  i turned my phone off for the day and went outside for a long walk today to help clear myself  it didnt help  but  it was better than the other thoughts that come across my mind throughout the day  i read all of your replies and just want to say thanks  and thanks to the ones that sent me direct messages too  this community is great to have people that are not selfish and care about others  ,1
no offense but i rather kill myself while i am in my   s than wasting my entire life working for the success of someone else barely surviving in this cruel world    ,1
if only dying were as simple as pressing  shut down  like on a computer so many years of pain i wouldn t have to have lived through  so many more years i won t have to be put through   jesus christ someone please just stop it all for me  ,1
the fear isn t in dying  my fear is failing to commit suicide and the pain that i ll feel as i try  if i had a gun it would be easier  but my only options  all require pain  i just have to get past the pain part and i ll be good to go   edit  i really don t care for what comes after i die   i just know that it s better than dealing with what s here for me  trust me  i ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world  but it s all been pointless  i have no fear of being dead  i just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing avoiding pain  if there s one thing in this life that i m sure of  it s that i want to die and it s not a fleeting thought  i think about it the majority of every day   the fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking  some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living  some of us have been beat down by life one too many times  i wish that was not the case  but unfortunately it is  it s really saddening to see  but i sympathize because i feel the same  ,1

i was born a hermaphrodite and i want to die because of it  i dont even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here  ive been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and i have no idea if talking about it will even help  all of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition i was born with and how ive been treated because of it   based on what i know  when i was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically  corrected  into a female  my parents have denied knowing anything about it  but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though im an adult  the only reasons i have information about it are because of scars  genital pain  and hormone  internal ultrasound testing from my gyno   nothing about my body is sexually correct  i have breasts  but i have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair  i have what should be a vagina  but its actually just a small hole so narrow that i cant even use a tampon  much less have sex with it  i was born with a phallus  but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris  it hurts a lot now  even as an adult  its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that its brought me to tears before  i cant even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly    ive always known that something was wrong about my body  even as a kid i knew that certain things werent right and that i didnt feel the way that other girls did  my parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me   my parents were very rigid about gender roles when i was growing up and they punished me whenever i didnt behave like my forcibly assigned sex  most of my earliest memories are of me crying because i was forced to wear dresses  makeup  and necklaces  i vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick   when i got older  it just got worse  my parents wouldnt let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought  werent for my gender   they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet  they refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were  girl colors   if i did anything that deviated from what they wanted  they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke  even now as an adult living in their house they do this  and theyve said physically threatening things like  youre not too old for us to spank you     when i turned    i started having serious medical problems  i ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries i was forced to have as a baby  i nearly died from it that winter  but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history    i didnt get diagnosed until i was     when my pain was getting so horrific that i had to quit school and my job  i went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that i was abnormal  i felt like a complete idiot when she told me  my parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school  and i was raised in such a strict religious environment that i sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like   and i felt so broken and stupid then    i was so scared of what would happen that i didnt tell my parents anything that my doctor told me  i had been dating my boyfriend for years already and i was so scared to tell him that i waited months before i said anything to him either    i just feel like such a failure  i was never even remotely happy as a woman  but i know that my family  my boyfriend  and everyone else could never accept me as a man either  and ive never felt like a man in the first place  ive always felt like i was something between that  even as far back as i can remember  but i know that people could never understand that  even someone as loving  patient  and kind as my boyfriend cant fully understand how deeply this hurts me   i feel so completely alone in the world  i feel mutilated  i feel like a disappointment to my family because i can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally  i cant take the pain anymore either  im constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back  ive been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood  and years of therapy havent helped me    i just want it to end  no more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin  no more feeling like im a horrible mistake  and no more feeling like its going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me    i wish there were a way to fix this  i wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where i could have been myself  but now i feel so lost and alone that i dont even know who or what i am  ,1
letter to myself  fuck you fuck you fuck you  you will never see clearly you delusional fucking idiot  you battle all day in your head and cant handle actual reality  you did this to yourself you fucking sloth  i fucking hate you  you will get whats coming to you ,1
casually suicidal  i would love for things to stop  time to hold still and so slowly fade  suicide will never be that peaceful  i think abt death often  i dont necessarily have plans for life  im just patiently waiting for death  like at a bus stop  i might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful i cant help but to want to go there   im constantly afraid  of everything  feeling silence would be amazing  point of this  idk i never told anyone this cus they would worry but i feel like i need to  dont worry tho  most likely i wont be taking an active role  ive desired death even stronger than now and ive been too afraid  so   edit   thanks for the comments  its nice knowing im not alone  if anyone would like advice since im just  waiting at my bus stop  doing what i can enjoy has been a great way to spend time  im in love with art  but hey if geeky stuff or insects is ur calling yo for it without shame  its probably gonna be the thing keeping u alive ,1
im jumping off a building in a few hours to end my pain  i never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes  since last month  ive been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself  i had no one to rely on  my bestfriend gets mad whenever i speak about my anxieties  saying that shes afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable  i cant speak to my parents about how i feel because they just tell me that  everybody has problems  and force me to keep going on with the routines i should be doing  i just want to shut down  i have no self esteem left and i have never felt this way before  this is probably going to be my last reddit post  i left home earlier today ready to do this  ive been told that id go to hell when i die  perhaps its time to go and check it out  ,1
do you ever just want to talk to someone about your suicidal feelings but then anxiety grabs you by the throat and chokes you until you have a breakdown  i m autistic so i m very prone to the classic  autistic meltdowns   i feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal  instead i m viewed as very weird and obsessive   people in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays  i know if i were normal  i d be happy and successful  no one will accept that my condition has made me a failure   yet i can t talk about it to anyone about this  i just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds  nowhere near enough to kill me  but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard    i dunno  i m a mess tbh     ,1
i plan my suicide     times per day if i get an urge to end my life while im at work  out running errands  with friends  etc   i usually zone out without realizing and think through exactly how i can kill myself after i leave that function  e g   i can go to this store for a rope but they close at    so ill have to leave early  then i can go here  so on and so forth     does anyone else have this issue   ill usually zone out for    seconds or so and people are wondering why i look all spaced out ,1
the love of my life killed himself three weeks ago ive decided to go too  nothing makes sense in this world without him it feels like i cant breathe    i really just needed to tell someone before i do it    thank you all   ,1

throwaway because i deserve to die  i a    year old male was raped by an attractive woman in my university my sophomore year    edit  it keeps getting buried in comments i have no insurance or no employment i have     dollars to my name   have inquired about planned parenthood and urgent care testing it ll be around           to get tested without insurance and i simply can t afford that right now  plus planned parenthood in my area is not testing until july    after it happened i dropped out of school and couldn t explain to my parents why i came home why i was so unmotivated    the people i told my story to couldn t believe a black guy in the military could be taken advantage of by a petite white woman   today while getting out the shower i noticed a single red bump in my genital area i had shaved the area a few days ago so i figured it could ve been a razor bump   i ve been disgusted with my body since the assault happened so i ve avoided sex since   i ve gone from weighing     pounds to weighing       lbs and ordering takeout nearly every night eating the pain away   after a drunk night and letting my anxiety get the best of me i decided to become a webmd doctor and self diagnose myself and the bump on my penis looks like it could be herpes   i m so afraid to get myself checked because if it s herpes my life will be ruined i ll never have a normal life again no man or woman will want me   i ll be forced to be alone   i m already a college dropout on the way to    years old unemployed   at this point i m a failure in life and when i get the balls to get checked out if it turns out he herpes or something incurable i believe the best course of action is to immediately remove myself from the gene pool and get rid of this disease the only way i know possible and kill myself   no one deserves to live like this   no one deserves to get this  ,1
its amazing how people act so attention seekingly on social media when people die  its one of the reasons i wont kill myself  the subject speaks for itself really  i just cant get over how so many f      ing worthless maggots would try to make my suicide a big  deal for them  even in the face of the fact that none of them have have even cared the slightest bit about me or my wellbeing   f       those people ,1

if anyone reads this thank you i cant take it anymore  its all so overwhelming   no one is listening  ive been practically alone my entire life  i dropped out of school in  th grade because my anxiety was so severe i just couldnt couldnt go   no one cared enough to make me go  which means im an actual idiot  like incredibly stupid  honestly i cant even remember how to multiply or divide  its humiliating  at that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online   hours away   around this time i got really depressed   cried everyday for like   months  i barely ate   stayed inside my room all day with only a tv connected to a cable box to keep me company  i didnt see her much for a year after that  that is until she came back   took me along with her to this small town that im in now  i think ive spent all my time on the internet the last   years because ive been mentally incapable of anything else  which means i cant drive  i dont have any friends  family or let alone a job  these are all things ive dreamt of practically all my life   theyre so far away  its becoming unbearable at this point  my mother   i arent on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me   i called the cops on him  i dont have any money right now  absolutely no family  no friends   i live in a small town without any real opportunitys available  im living off my mother   the minute she decides i have to go im going to be homeless  recently ive been begging her to take me to just get an id   help me apply for jobs  she keeps ignoring me   i know this is my problem but i dont have any money   i dont know what or how im supposed to do it  all im asking for is just a job so maybe i can figure things out but i cant even have that  i fucked up   now its too late for me  my only option is suicide which is inevitable but im scared   i want to live  ,1
therapy was the worst thing that happened to me a few years ago when i was suicidal i was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change  at the time  it made sense  but looking back i feel like such an idiot    as i got to the hospital i was honest about how i felt suicidal  but made no plans to commit suicide  and had no method  the doctor told me that soon he d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me  the second they got me a wheelchair i knew my mistake  i shouldn t have been honest at all  they all lied to me  there was no discussion  no prescription change  they locked me up in the hospital and for three days i didn t even know how long i d be there    when i finally got to meet with the doctors there  they wouldn t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child  they were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn t listen to my diagnosis i told them i already had  episodic depression or major depressive  i forget because it s been a few years and we ve talked about other things  what i do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one i already said i have  like it was new     like they diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college     one of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend  who is a guy  i m a woman  and i had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it  it was so fucking weird  like they asked me who my support system was and i said   my friends  like this girl  that girl  and guy  and they re like who is guy            like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though i already said he s a friend of mine    i had made some friends while i was in there  some i still keep in contact with  but worst was just that im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience    i had nightmares for weeks  the anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me  having no privacy  no real clothes  being constantly treated like a child  it was all so terrible    it sucked  it wasn t worth it  i ve learned to never tell a therapist you re suicidal  ,1
i sleep a lot so i dont have to deal with being awake im tired  im tired of being tired  today i found out i am royally fucked  my graduate project is faced with ballooning expenses and department politics just cost me   department grants i desperately needed  one of them was straight up given to a guy who doesnt even know what his project is  when the fucking grant requires a detailed research plan  i worked weeks on these fucking grants because i knew they were important  i got a paltry sum from some consolation prize  its nowhere near enough    my advisor wrote both my rec letter and the other guys  i dont think he has any faith in me if this is the outcome  im fucked and so is my career  i feel completely betrayed    ive had enough of this shit  im tired of throwing out all my energy and effort into a system that doesnt care  i want to go to bed  but i have to keep working    this program took my love of science through a meat grinder and i have another year to go  unless i withdraw and lose everything  ,1
anyone else feel like they just aren t meant for life  i ve been trying so hard for my loved ones sake  but i just can t  i can t fit the mold of living in a way that s respectful to myself and others  i m so full of self hate and doubt i hate the person i ve become  but it s who i am now  it s not a sickness anymore  it s me  i don t know any other way of life besides what i am now  i just don t fit the mold of life  i can t be happy i can t be sad i m just here  i ve always romanticized suicide but the more i think about it the more of a viable and inevitable option it becomes  is it so wrong of me to want to rid the world of myself  so i can stop fighting  stop feeling hollow  is it selfish to do that  i don t see how such a inter personal action could be considered selfish  idk anymore ,1
does anyone else have visual thoughts of their suicide  i have suicidal thoughts daily and visualizations of killing myself for the past     years  i am     theyre not really intentional just a reaction to the deep pain and stress i go through every single day of my life  its a shitty learned hopelessness coping mechanism ive created to cope everytime something bad happens i can just see it ,1
in twenty six days  i am throwing a moving away party  i dont have the heart to tell my friends i am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move  its strange to me how happy i feel now that ive picked the date  i feel at peace with the idea  but i havent made any specific plans yet on the method      the reasons why im suicidal and why im moving are really similar  i feel so broken and tired  ive battled mental illness for    of the    years ive been alive  its really drained me and robbed me of my full potential  whenever i seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms  things come crashing down    im a high functioning depressed person  i have an active social life  i have a good job  i have some good hobbies  i try to see a therapist and take medication  but deep down  theres a lot of darkness i carry  nobody knows at work that i constantly question how i should take my life everyday  or if life is worth living  its the first thought through my head when i wake up  when ive tried to open up to people  they treat me like im a burden or a liability  i feel so trapped in a persona that ive built for myself   i put up a facade of a happy and energetic person  i decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life  but the big secret i carry is i dont want to start over   ive really struggled  ive taken countless meds  ive seen a therapist for over three years  ive learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how ive been feeling  im really tired  i tried to kill myself when i was    and got hospitalized  i thought that was a low point i would rebuild from  six years later  when i was     my girlfriend hung herself  this year  i got diagnosed with bipolar ii  im sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs  i dont want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life   so in    days  my friends will all get together for one last party  theyll say their goodbyes  and theyll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time  i think this is the time im going to do this  i could move     miles away  but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again  i dont want to live anymore  i love the people in my life so much  but i cant carry this anymore  i want to die so badly      i know this will break some people close to me  that tears me up so bad  but in the end  this is something i need to do for myself  ,1
i cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore for most of my life  i have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much   like a safety net    but the opposite   in my mind i would play out different scenarios    some quick and practical  others more extravagant and poetic   i would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto   it was a huge help   recently  i have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving  and tonight i realized that if i was to end my life  it would completely break her   so now  with great sadness  i have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector   the future seems so much harder now   thanks for listening  ,1
does anyone else just wish someone would come up behind them and just shoot them in the head  i want to die so beyond badly  but i dont have the courage to do it myself  im afraid of failing  becoming brain dead  becoming paralyzed  getting committed and losing my job  my boyfriend    i just wish someone would do it quick for me this way i wouldnt be scared or nervous about it  itd just finally be over  im such a coward    ,1
how can they say that suicidal people arent doing something about their problems  we literally want to kill ourselves  thats not easy  you know  yeah  you wouldnt know  and not because we want to die  but because we dont fucking want to be alive and who the fuck gives you the right to judge my life and actions anyway  go fuck yourself  ,1
how do people work everyday in jobs they hate without wanting to kill themselves  i mean seriously  i just graduated college  got a job and now im realizing i may have to keep this shit up for       years  at this rate i might not even survive my first year  how do people do this  why would you want to work the rest of your life  doing something you dont like for what in the end  ,1
ever feel like you werent meant to be in this world  i feel like i belong nowhere  a lot of the time  when i try doing something i always wanted to do  i ask myself after  is that really it    i feel like i should be in another world or something ,1
it s my   th birthday   ive never wanted to die more in my life  edit  i had never been on this sub before  i typed suicide into the search bar after an intense breakdown  i wrote out my post and hit send  force closed the app  i went for a walk with my son who s under one  i forgot i had even posted this till right now while i m sitting on the toilet a day later  i m currently bawling my eyes out in relief  i am curious about the future  today feels lighter than the societal pressures of yesterday  i am for lack of a better word overwhelmed by what an amazing community this sub is and i m thankful for all of your support  please keep pushing one day at a time if you felt anything like i did yesterday  for those of you asking  yes i have been through a tremendous amount of difficult lessons as i m sure many of you have  i m currently watching my mother battle her bipolar disorder while trying to raise a child hoping this won t be his future watching me  but being rational enough to know mental illness is a constant battle    thank you all again  i love myself  but i am exhausted  i feel as if i m army crawling through life with bloody fingers   but i ll keep on keepin on  ,1
anxiety mistaken for rudeness and disregard for respect  depression mistaken for laziness and not willing to put effort forward  im     im gonna kill myself this year sometime this year  sometime soon  i didnt have a childhood yet im being thrown into adulthood as if i can handle it  i was never stable never since a child never since age   or    never fucking stable  im sorry im this way i didnt want to be  but fuck you for making this all about you  fuck you for putting it all on me as if im not affected by suicide attempt  by my mother practically abandoning me  by being left alone for years as a kid  as being bullied by my own family  by years of isolation of just wanting to straight up murder myself because thats so stupid  fuck everyone  fuck you  fuck family  fuck  friends   fuck my boyfriend  go die and fuck yourself  edit  i thought this would go washed under new  maybe a few upvotes and a comment  but not this  thank you for making me feel heard for once  ,1
fuck this pointless world who the fuck decided we needed     years of school then you need to work a miserable job until you die   same fucking routine every day  vacations once a year if youre lucky  how can people not be depressed  youre fucking brainwashed if you think that this is how life is supposed to be   ,1
does anyone get horrible  horrible heartache that literally is so physically painful  when im sad  like really  really  sad  i get these sharp pains in my heart that are continuous and jerk tears  it hurts so much at times that it spreads throughout my body and i flinch and curl up in pain while my tears uncontrollably drop down my cheeks  my stomach hurts  and my whole body begins to ache  my head starts to pound and thats when i find comfort in the idea of ending it all   that theres a way out  thinking about it gives me comfort  writing letters to everyone gives me comfort  until it feels real and it all comes back and i miss people that i love  i miss the way things were and i miss when i didnt fuck everything up  i miss when i was loved unconditionally  ,1
my friends having a good time is driving me to suicide i know how stupid it sounds  but their lives are getting better and better and mine is slipping from my hands  i was feeling fine until a couple of days ago  then i saw them after a long time and theyre just having fun  being social  meeting new people and being awesome all around  meanwhile i get panic attacks in public at the thought of having to speak to someone    after seeing them socialize i just lost all hope  all my efforts dont matter if im too awkward to do anything with the results the thought of having to see functional people like them again is making me crave death more and more     and nobody is gonna read this cause its a a wall of text from a socially inept wreck  if youre on this subreddit i suppose its cause youre going trough something aswell  i hope everything gets better for you ,1

i just want to sleep and never wake up again  anyone else feel the same  im     years old  on the outside i lead a perfectly normal life  i have a  decent salary  friends i speak to regularly  i get along with everybody  at work  i do have goals  ambitions and hobbies   if  you ever met me  you would not have the slightest clue that ive been  diagnosed as clinically depressed  ive had multiple suicide attempts   one which was truly close where if i didnt have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time frame i would not be here  ive been with  psychiatric teams  and a few therapists  its all a temporary measure in  the end   i am a high performer in my  workplace  and i have many who rely on me for support  i always smile   and i try my best to make others happy whenever i can  but at the end of  every day  i feel empty  most times i have suicidal thoughts  there are  people i am able to speak to and open up about how i feel  however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them   in more  recent times  my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent  i have a  strong feeling i may be edging towards attempting suicide once again   ive taken a few days off work hoping it may help  however i believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly   there is a  brief moment of what i can only describe as insanity that grips me  and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance  whether its  my belt around my neck  a blade against my wrist  or pills in my palm  i  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks  however it is likely i may soon lose   i  am not here for advice or sympathy  the purpose for this post is to  just say depression does not discriminate  you do not have to have been  through a traumatic event  or to have certain physical attributes you  hate  feeling alone etc  to be depressed  sometimes you just are  and it  could be for no particular reason at all  we are all human in the end   and were all on the same spectrum  best wishes to you all  ,1

i want to commit suicide on xmas eve just like my sibling my brother killed himself on xmas eve  when i was extremely young  i still have very vivid memories of it  and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didnt really bother them  no one talks about it or mentions him  they have practically erased him from our familys history  maybe its because they were ashamed he was gay  or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide    maybe both   either way  i want to join him   now that ive grown up  i understand why he did what he did  i understand that he wasnt wrong  and i dont feel like id be in the wrong for doing the same    id be doing the world a favor   i feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since i was a child  its been nothing but chaos  i was preconditioned not to ever trust  i was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdads friends  my mother stayed with a known pedophile while i was relegated to foster care and group homes    i feel like i wasnt ever even just given a fair chance  yet  i went on to get married once a upon a time  i had two kids  i got a divorce  i started a business  i got my bachelors degree  i bought a house       and then i became addicted to alcohol    i made so many stupid choices leading up to now  and because of that  i now have nothing  my children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents  and the courts were correct  im a fuck up  theres no telling where wed end up if they were here  but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box  ive been sober for almost this entire past yea  minus maybe four or five total slip ups   i thought that might fix a lot of my issues  but it hasnt fixed a thing    i destroyed my last relationship  i hurt my partner in countless ways  after we broke up for a month  he begged me to come back  and i swore id do better or try to be better  i tried as hard as i could   but ive had to accept that being a shitty person is just who i am  i cant change that about myself  its embedded in my personality  i broke him into tiny shards of glass  and all he could do when i tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back  i turned a good person into a horrible  conniving man     i cant get the job i want  all of my stuff is in storage and i cant pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever   even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me  their ultrasounds  their footprints from their first day alive    my car is gone now  too   i cant drive to get to work  i cant drive to an interview  i cant drive to a doctor or a mental hospital  i live in the middle of nowhere  and i have no resources  i cant take on new clients and make money  ive fallen as far down the hole as i can  and theres no way back up   ive had my friends tell me that i should be proud   that i should just stick things out  because things will get better  but things will never improve  and i havent felt like i could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable     there is literally no way to return to the life that i worked so hard to build  or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being  i dont have the money  i dont have the resources  and i am too afraid to ask my friends or  family  for help    i feel like theyd be far less inconvenienced if i just didnt exist  i feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life  i feel like all of the work i put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing  i feel like i am a waste of oxygen and space  i feel like all i do is destroy people  and hurt their feelings    i have no one  my mother and i are estranged  my remaining siblings and i hardly ever talk  im incapable of nurturing a relationship  im incapable of being a mother just like my mother was   i have nothing left  and i have no more motivation to continue on   i just want to disappear  i want it to appear that i just left without saying a word  no one would notice  because i have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone  i am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into  and i dont want to face anyone or burden them with my problems  i dont want to keep trying to fix something that isnt fixable    im a fucked up person in a fucked up world  people keep trying to tell me that i have so much to live for   that i have so much talent and potential  people keep telling me to keep trying  but they arent the ones who have to try so its easy for them  they dont have to live with me  i do  i hate who i am and who ive become    i know that im sorry  i cannot even begin to describe the remorse that i feel for all of my selfish behaviors  and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down  i wish i had treated everyone better  my kids  my kids dad and his wife  my friends and my remaining family     im everything that i never wanted to be   practically homeless  with absolutely nothing  i have no personality  i have nothing positive to add to the world  ive become so jaded to the thought of dying   like its going to happen someday  so why do i  and others  keep trying to delay the inevitable    im sorry if this seemed rambley  i had considered writing letters to a couple of people  but i figure putting it here   anonymously   would be better  i dont want my kids to know i killed myself    so im going to disappear to a place where i will never be found  i dont want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind  im afraid theyll think im just begging for attention  or maybe they will think i dont mean what i say    but i really do want to die   thanks  reddit  ,1
funny when they say  suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem  when all your existing is the problem in the first place  when  life is just one big pain in the ass  to me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time    this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enough its so cold and boring and so so tiring its really dreadful    some people do have temporary problems    but the others have problems that wont be fixed  like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone     some people cant really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can  heal  magically   and like depression too    some people tried everthing to overcome depression but they failed   so please stop saying that really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do   no hate in the comments thats only my opinion    edit   holy shit omg thanks for all of you commenting on this post   it got attention really fast lol i gusse im not the only one feeling this way huh    ,1
born to die  has anyone else had the thought if suicide for as long as they can remember  like it comes and goes  but ya get the feeling that it is your  destiny  kind of   as if its inevitable at some point that its gonna happen regardless of what you do or dont do    or is it just me  ,1
i always wonder how it feels to live a happy life i ve been depressed for so long i can t even remember how it feels to be consistently happy and okay with life  i want to know the feeling of enjoying my life and it s crazy to think that most people around me have a mostly happy life and here i am thinking about suicide every few hours of the day  it s also crazy how you don t even know if someone might be feeling the same as you  i hope everyone reading this has a great day  edit  i didn t really think this many people would see this and comment  but it s nice to know i m not alone  i hope everyone finds what they are looking for and gets through the struggles in your lives  ,1

my    year old brother hung himself and all i want to do is die too    i just feel so hopeless  so fucking hopeless  everyday i wake up and think about him and how the possibility of me moving out at    caused him to despise me and hate me  i had become increasingly distant weeks before he passed because i was so busy with work  getting a new apartment  etc  and i hate being so mad at myself for not being able to be there  i wish i would have been the one to die instead  i am a bitter and angry person all the time and no matter what i do i just can t seem to get rid of all this anger and aggression i feel  my boyfriend doesn t help  just gets mad at me for being mad  i just want to give up  i haven t cut for over a year but lately it s been the only thing to help anything  i just want my brother back  i ve never thought suicide was so selfish until i lost my best friend and all i want is to see him again  it hurts  a piece of my heart is gone  i just wish i could have been the one to die instead   i just wish i would have died instead  ,1
i want to die but dont want to kill myself therapist says im being too extreme but honestly  im just too average at everything to be happy with myself  im too dumb to get any of the jobs i want to actually have and im too smart to be able to settle for something menial and be fufilled  im not depressed enough to need serious intervention but im not stable enough to be truly without it  im average at everything or worse  i can never achieve what i want to because i am simply not intelligent enough  i dont even have the will power to end everything  im just pathetic and weak  ,1
the foo fighters saved my life this sunday night  i was about to end my life  i took a few painkillers  sleeping pills and drank some beers  i was just about to slit my wrist  when the radio played my absolute favorite song  my hero   this song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling  a big improvement after days of pure numbness  just enough to get me to call an ambulance   i m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away  i hope  it stays this way    thank you so much for reading this and please stay strong  ,1
i would rather kill myself than grow as a person im fucking done with life man  life fucking sucks in every which way  i do not want to be honest about who i am  i do not want yo grow  i do not want to accept anything  i do not want responsible  i dont want to work hard or be a part of anyones life  i dont want to make a difference or contribute to society  having a career of any kind is too much fucking work  the truth is im perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out  the  ill logically be on the streets and at that point i will kill myself  but why let it go that far  why shouldnt i buy a gun asap and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me  when i want nothing to do with that  im a loser and im okay with that  not being a loser is seriously too much work  giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work  i just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that i dont give a shit about my life or other people and im not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word  ,1
i really just wish someone gave a fuck about me this is my throwaway account that s why it has jake paul as the name it s a joke    i remember when i was a kid and i thought i d have a wife or girlfriend when i grew up  what a fucking joke  instead here i am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me  i ve started texting this girl that i asked out and she of course rejected me because i m a lowlife piece of shit  she always hits me up first and she s the only reason basically i have any hope at all except deep down i know she doesn t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me  because of the fucking pandemic i don t even have soccer  the only thing that kept me going every week  the only time when i feel myself and can express myself and don t want to fucking kill myself  my best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and i m completely alone  the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn t because of the quarantine    i m not gonna make it through   more weeks of this i just wish i had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it s gonna be ok and i wish i could say this stuff to my friends but i m a man and i can t show emotion or i look like a pussy  i just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy i m such a loser idk i just want to be happy again it s been so long     big update  asked her out she said she liked me too but we under quarantine lmao ,1
this world is messed up  i love this subreddit but it s really concerning to see so much pain and hurt in one place  to know how many people are suffering quietly without others knowing sucks  especially on just one part of the internet  to all the guys and girls out there i hope you find happiness  ,1
i m so tired of not having a social life  i m tired of being mentally ill  i just want to die  ,1
ever feel like you want to just go to sleep and never wake up instead of actually dying   ,1
 you only get to live once  shut up  shut the fuck up  please stop trying to be a therapist to boost your own ego  im sick and tired of hearing  but have you tried doing   blank    or  i know how it feels   if you really did know how it feels  you would shut the fuck up and let me die  oh and  you will hurt your loved ones   will i really  maybe you have people that care for you and like you  but i just dont  no one cares about me  its one of the reasons i want to die  i am in pain  let me just end it  just be honest that you  the people here on this sub that try to stop others  are just doing it to feel better about yourselves  to feel like you changed someones life for the better but in reality  your empty words dont help  all of you commenting shit like  itll get better  or  you have so much to live for  dont give a single shit for the people posting here  you are just here because you think  well  if i comment something nice  and they dont kill themselves  i did something good   ,1
the  reasons to live  askreddif thread only made me feel worse there are people out there who can be content with the smell of freshly fallen rain and warm garlic bread meanwhile i could have everything and still be miserable   that entire thread was just a reminder that im too broken to relate to other people and ill never be happy  ,1
i don t want attention  i don t want anyone to notice me  i just want to leave i hate how people act like suicidal people all want attention  if i could be erased from the memory of everyone around me and vanish right now i would  i ve never wanted attention  i m just tired ,1
i feel so low it physically hurts my heart hurts from the pain  i wish i could just disappear  my parents have gone through so much because of me  they do so much to make me happy  even my siblings are jealous  i feel so guilty they have to deal with me  see their child try to kill themselves everyday  crying from depression  i just want them to know i love them so much  i can t even describe how much i love them  and i m so sorry for what i m doing  what i am feeling  what i am going to do in the future  i would love to change  but i can t   i just wish there is something i can do to feel happy again  ,1
does anyone here talk to literally no one  like no friends  i m rotting anyone else rotting away and dying in this shithole prison cell known as life  i m not exaggerating either when i say i talk to no one   i can t think  i can t talk i m a degenerate peace  of shit  ,1
i want to die but afraid of dying    death  death  death  that is all i can think of right now  however  i am scared of dying  the thought of the hereafter scares me to death  what will happen to me after committing suicide  i keep asking myself this question whenever i think of suicide  i also ask myself these questions  how will my loved ones react to my death  what if in the final moments i regret my choice  will it be painful  and finally  what awaits me after death   as a religious person  it is not fun at all  suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair  i just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity  but i am sure the fire will be my punishment if i were to commit suicide  but at the same time  i am suffering in this world  so really it all comes down to what is worse  i choose suffering here   but at the same time not  i want to end it all  the shame  the struggle  the pain  everything in this world i hate  there is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire  not even my loved ones  and i do not even feel selfish writing this  i am being honest   someday i am sure suicide will be my only option  then the fear of hellfire will be gone  even if it is not gone  i will be so lost and sad  losing my faith  and then i will commit suicide  i cannot wait for that day to come  i will then slice my throat open and  finally  put an end to all my suffering  or  on the other hand  start a journey full of great suffering  as you can tell  i am contradicting myself all the time  that is because i am lost  and very sad  i want to die  ,1
i told my mom im suicidal  she forgot  a few weeks ago i was doing a few chores with her when i broke down and told her that i hated life and that all i ever did when i woke is wishing something would kill that day because im not brave enough to do it myself  she called me ungrateful and i snapped and slapped her  it was wrong and i did apologize after it  she cried and thats where it ended  today i broke down again and told her i needed help  she told me that i can talk to her whenever i want to wich i answered  dont you remember what happened the last time we talked   she said that she did remember  that she remember how i slapped her  when i asked her if she remembers why i did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked  what were we talking about   im crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again  if my mom doesnt even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesnt care enough and if she doesnt  who does  im just a waste anyways  ,1
can someone just hug me while i cry  its all too much  i lost all my motivation  ,1
i have no friends  nobody ever contacts me first and im okay with it  im a failed professional who is miles behind academically and professionally my friends  so i dont care about seeing them  they never contact me first and i havent bothered my ass to contact them in months  im at a point now where i say fuck it do i live a life without friends or just end it all now and find peace  forgot to mention i have zero self esteem ,1
okay so  im     i have type   diabetes  cervical cancer  and a brain tumor  im putting serious financial strain on my family with all these medical bills  i just dont see the point in putting them through this  and myself through all the awful treatment  just to like     die anyway  its hard to stay positive and find the will to live  any advice  ,1
does anyone else feel like they dont want to kill themselves but they wish to die everyday  its hard to kill yourself here  and the person i trusted the most to talk to betrayed me  i just wish everyday maybe a car will hit me  or some mugger will shoot me in the head   ,1
im    my parents make me want to kill myself the only thing stopping me is my dog i need help ,1

young doctor    yo  with suicide thoughts first  thank you for opening the post  im sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me  please share your thoughts or advise in life  summary is that i spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy usa healthcare system  but to this day after    years of formal education and experience  i continue to be unemployed and financially useless  now struggling with covid   lockdown  depression and suicide ideas    young male physician here     yrs  from latin america  yes  we also use reddit  ive been having suicide thoughts  but not currently depressed  i feel like a fucking failure in life   since school i aced exams  test  scores  got honors on my graduation  was extremely dedicated  learned guitar  learned english  i was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations  went to the university at age    and i stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor  let me explain  medicine is a tough career  very difficult  it is academically  mentally and economically demanding  the amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive  and drains you mentally  socially isolates you from family  friends  parties  relationships  etc   a dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors  pretty much everywhere  medical residency is like that and i seriously suffered that bs during my   year medical internship  at that time they evaluated me  so i had no word to defend myself  but i graduated after   years of traning  in my country    escaping common crime violence in my country  i went to usa to become a doctor there  by passing the usmle exams  the most difficult exams ever in my life  i spent   more years studying for those expensive exams  and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections  life in the us as immigrant if tough man  nobody wants to employ you due to visa  you cannot earn any money  i did cleaning  mopping floors  dog walking and other odd jobs to support me  which is illegal as foreigner   when i had all the requirements  guess what  you have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the usa each year  so i spent       only in applications and flying tickets  i received few interviews in hopes to get a job  but did not get anything  and lost        i tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost  i felt fucking scammed  and to this day im still angry at my experience in the usa   i spent like         of my third world hard earned dollars in the whole process  paying rents  bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing  nobody will employ you in healthcare if you dont do a residency first  which i failed to secure twice  and nobody will employ you at any job in the us if you are not citizen    stupid years wasted     years of home training   i came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job  i faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here  there are just too many doctors today  i lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available  but then covid    happened  my country is in lockdown  im quarantined  unemployed  with no money  no financial power  living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime  paralized temporarily due pandemic   living off the charity of others  unable to move  unable to sleep due suicide thoughts  and writing this  most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries  i feel like im in the starting line  im now almost    years old  indebted  single and poor  im ashamed of what i experienced  im ashamed to say im unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job  and still hunting for one  im a miserable unemployed doctor    you want to make it worse  law in my country requires me to serve in the covid emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse  totally unpaid or i could be charged a fine or brief jail time      failure is the word to describe what i am  i hate myself  i constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and i blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of god despite me being religious  education was in vain in my life  the only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents  but after i bury them  i think i might take the shot    im sorry you had to read the long post  sometimes i feel i did nothing wrong  i studied  i graduated  i behaved  i followed the rules  and also the usa rules  did not became an asshole  murderer or alcoholic or anything  but still life kicks me in the balls  then why cant i be offered a fucking job  i no longer care about medicine  i no longer care about myself  but i might care in what you have to say  please react to my life story  i will read you thoroughtly ,1
i dont want people to remember me  i only want my close friends and family members to remember me    not people i havent talked to in a year or so    its offensive to me  you could have talked to me and you could have cared  but untill i take my own life  you suddenly care and miss me    i dont mean to offend anyone on this post    ,1
i fucking hate my brain its such a goddamn stupid piece of shit and i wish i could blow it out  ,1
cant even have the smallest fucking things  im just so angry with life and fucking done  nothing will ever change for the better its all a fucking joke  ,1
suicide is on my mind      but i know all that i really want is to feel like i m loved  hi everyone  my name is everett  i m turning    soon and i ve grown up in an abusive religious family  i switched schools last year because i had to take care of my grandparents because they can t support themselves anymore  my last school i got bullied a lot and people didn t take me seriously when i talked  i don t get bullied at my new school but it s because of other reasons  people started making rumors of me at my new school that i was gonna kill everyone and  shoot up  the school i don t know who my real friends are and which ones just don t want to be the  target  for  when i shoot up the school  because i have asperger syndrome  i ve been rejected my whole life to the point where i have no self confidence  my longest relationship ever was   month  i want something that s longer but i feel like no one trusts me  my mother hates me because i constantly fuck up  and i turned out to be a male at birth instead of female  she wanted a girl  my real dad is a drunk bastard and i disconnected ties with him   years ago  my step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks i have to follow his religious rules but he doesn t  he constantly emotionally abuses me when i do things  not holy   i ve wanted to run away since i can remember up till about  th grade when i realized with my state s laws that i can t and it would be easier to end myself  so i ve attempted suicide   times since then and i m such a failure i can t even kill myself properly  again  you might say that  i don t need a girlfriend at my age  but i feel as if that is the only thing i want anymore  i recently got a job and i bought a few things that i thought might help but of course it didn t  i just want to feel as if i m loved and i want to turn my sadness into love for them  but of course i can t have it  i m doubting what i believe in right now  the only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats  i also think i m a psychopath  ive pointed a loaded     at my step dad before and if anything i should ve pulled the fucking trigger  but of course  i m such a fucking pussy i couldnt even do that properly   people keep telling me it ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse  parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted  i constantly build everything up because i don t want to hurt anyone and i don t know when it ll come out  everyone that i think i might have a chance with pushes me away after i express my feelings to them it just has gotten to the point i can remember the last time i ve smiled  i have to wear a mask in front of my parents  emotional mask  because if they found out i wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems  i have to wear a mask everywhere i go because someone could report it and my parents would find out  it doesn t help either that every adult i know doesn t take me seriously because i m not an adult  anyways if you ve read up to this point  thank you   no formatting because i m on my phone rn  ,1

you ever wish someone would kill you so you wouldn t have to do it  purposefully running around late at night through shady places  not paying attention when nearing roads  almost  accidentally  getting hit by a car ,1
im a waste tonight i was going to do it  in my parents home  i was going to lay on my bed and bleed out from my wrists and die    my mom walked in when i was just lightly scraping my skin to mark where id cut later tonight  she said  i just wanted to see you   i had to hide my body under the covers so that i could keep her from seeing what i had done to my arm and my body at that point  she came in and laid down on my bed and rest her head on my lap   its comfortable   she said  i tried my best to hold back tears    she eventually left and now im here  staring at my razorblade  wondering why im left here as a sympathetic  pitiful loser  all i can imagine is my mom opening the door to my childhood bedroom and seeing my blood stained mattress with a lifeless sack of organs on top  i can imagine her crying    i feel like a waste of money and time  the thousands of dollars that have been pumped into me for the promise of a successful future is too much  the time that people have invested in me for relationships and friendships is too much time that wouldve been better spent anywhere else  the only time i enjoy is time wasted on videogames and music  i am less than mediocre at both    my whole life has been infested with lies and attention whoring  ive lied about my age online so that guys wouldnt be afraid to talk to me  ive created a whole new person that interacts with me and my friend group online just so i can make my other friends jealous  i lie to my friends to manipulate them into doing what i want them to do  as for the attention whoring  ive done enough of it in my early teens  at     i was telling men online that i was     id send them pictures of myself so that i could get validation  i craved the romantic attention that i never got at that age   its now   am and im still here  scoring my thighs and spitting on the wounds  ive taken breaks while typing this and i feel like im ready  i just need some validation that im not the only one that knows that their life is completely fucked from decisions made by themselves    so  speaking of decisions that i made that fucked up my life  im living with     scoliosis that gives me severe backpain that  shocker  i have given to myself  i  as the attention whore i was in elementary school  longed for something that would make me different from the other kids at school  i sat in weird postures and slept in strange positions until my spine decided to follow through with my plan  the next scoliosis check that i had  i was told to get checked for scoliosis  lo and behold  now im at a     curve that requires a long and painful surgery to fix   i also fucked with my eyesight as a child so that i could get glasses  now im stuck with  mm thick lenses in my glasses that signify that im legally blind to anyone that even sees my glasses   i again fucked up my life when i decided to go along with my parents narrative and pretend to be christian  now ive been working at my church for   years  ive also been attending and tithing every week  im in the worship band and am currently planning a summer retreat  after    years of church  i still dont know what the fuck is going on   im tired of being the second child that is happy and creative and spontaneous and yay      im tired of asking for help and never getting any  im tired of lying to people  im tired of being a waste of time and money  im tired of being completely mediocre  im so tired   it is now  am and im going to do it in   hours    time to write an unorganized essay for a suicide note   would it be funny if i wrote it like how highschoolers write their essays  idk  thanks for reading my rambling and my unorganized baby babble  edit  haha im still here  im still here  im still here   i spent all night last night trying to write a suicide note  trying to justify myself  trying to excuse myself from living  i wrote a crude one and posted it here before i started the one i meant for my parents and friends  i got three pages in and i fell asleep from exhausting myself mentally and physically  a dark  dreamless sleep that has left me contemplating this morning  i look down at my thighs and my wrists and wonder if dying is really what i want  i read the beginning of my note and pity the author  my sheets are bloody from my thighs and i know my mom can already only handle the smallest bit of blood before going queasy    am i going insane  i cant follow through on anything  and now i cant follow through on my own suicide attempt  i had it all planned out and scheduled so that i could finally have something that i scheduled correctly  now im   hours late to my own death   i read the comments in this post and ive spent the past   minutes trying to figure out a way to tell you im still here  i cant tell if what you all have said is something i should be grateful for or if i should despise you  i guess my answer will come in time    in the meantime  im still here and i still feel like shit  i felt like this kind of update is needed to this type of situation  ,1
it s  am  i have my first class of the semester in   hours and i can t sleep i wasted my whole fucking summer looking for jobs and getting nothing  i can t do internships because my grades suck  my whole family thinks i m a lazy sack of shit for  not doing anything  and instead of relaxing for two months i was just stressing to make sure i could make      a month  i m stressed because literally nobody around me fucking needs me  ,1
i wish i could give my life to someone who wants to live sometimes  i wish i could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can  i do not have any enthusiasm for life  and it seems like a waste  i feel like i am going through the motions  just waiting to die    and its going to be a long wait  i have been in therapy for    years  and its constantly like this  i wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing   see  there is nothing in this world that brings me joy  i do not have any hobbies  and i do not have a job  i am going to be evicted if i do not find something before may  and while i have been applying  i also dont see the point  i have this black and white image in my head   like a flipbook   of me going through the motions until i am older enough to retire  i think i would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts  there mornings where i wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again  thats really what i am doing    i am waiting to die   it kind of feels good to type this out  i have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks  its almost like ive forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like  my boyfriend recently moved away  and we hardly talk anymore  my therapist dumped me  its a long story   it was kinda my fault  so dont blame her   so i am without support  or structure   i do not have any friends  my family thinks i am being a drama queen and wont  play  this game with me anymore  if i were to kill myself tonight  i wonder how long it would take the world to notice  i imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains   i have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs  but i am not      certain that an overdose would be successful  im     sure since i have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol   i dont drink  so i image i dont have a lot of tolerance   it almost feels like i can pull it off  my biggest fear is failing  i am afraid i will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt  god  i dont want to spend more time in a psych ward   ,1
i wish boys were allowed to be feminine without being judged  i m a feminine guy and i just want to express it when i m at school  the judgement that i get is too much to bear and the only thing that i can get away with is a flower in my hair  and even then i get a few insults hurled at me  i would do much more if i wasn t judged  i can t express who i am to the world and have to bottle it up   i fucking hate this  this is just a minor point in the many reasons i just want to kill myself  ,1
every single night i think about killing myself before sleeping   ,1
my father is tired of me  hurting  my mother  he is offering to find me an apartment so i can live alone and away from her  i will use this opportunity to kill myself  as i mentioned in previous posts  my mother is emotionally and physically abusive to me  she has the gal to blame me for enraging her to do these things  my father is getting tired of her constant tantrums  and is offering to give me an apartment he will pay for so she can be free of me   i will use this to my advantage to finally end my own life  once i am alone in my apartment  with no one to stop me or witness me  i will overdose on all my medication pills at the same time  then  i will die and finally know peace  maybe then my parents will know peace too  ,1
i have been struggling the past three months  my mom died and my boyfriend of   years left  nobody understands the pain  and nobody understands the situation  my mom wouldve  my mom wouldve told me all the right things instead of all the shit im hearing right now  i want to go to my mom  so i have a bottle of pills in my hand  and im waiting for my dad and my brother to fall asleep  so i can sleep  so i can see her again  ,1
enough i am    years old  another failed relationship  no kids     brothers and sisters only one speaks to me  i was convicted of manslaughter at    years old and spent   years in prison  prior to that was raised in system in southern california  dad was murdered when i was   and mom is a junky  i know all the things people want to say  sadly  im just tired of chasing a dream  i have seriously  given this a really good shot  the only positive thing i did in my life was quit drinking four years ago  dont know why im posting here  just interested i guess to see what if anything will come of it  take care ,1
currently in hospital jumped of my house s roof and ended up with a broken hip  arm and leg and a broken skull and needed surgery  dont do it is not worth it  i m very homesick right and i m going inpatient to the psych ward soon  life is shit but we all gotta keep fighting  edit  my house is not two story but three  ,1
id kill myself today if it wasnt for my family  id ruin their lives i hate myself but i know if i commit suicide  ill destroy my family  ill ruin their lives and theyll be so sad    ,1
is there really a good reason to be alive  seriously  all i see on here is people saying the same things   it will get better     what about your family or friends     suicide is a permanent solution is a temporary problem   saying the same things over and over again that don t mean anything  is there a reason suicidal people should stay alive besides living for other people  so other people won t feel bad about it    all i keep seeing are these the same cringy quotes and it s just making me even more suicidal  i swear if i hear more of that dumb shit i m going to just end it already  ,1
passive suicidal thoughts whenever im at a crosswalk and a car is stopped for me  i think of getting them to step on it  whenever im at the top of a staircase  i think of letting myself fall down it  whenever im at a ledge  i think of stepping over it and hitting the ground below  even though these things probably wouldnt kill me and would just leave me with some horrible injuries  i still cant help but think of them every single day  theres always that ever so slight push in the back of my mind trying to guide me into giving up and giving in to these thoughts  ,1
who else is waiting until they feel theyre allowed to kill themselves  personally my mom couldnt bear with it so im waiting until she passes away  once this happens i can finally end this misery  ,1
this will get lost in a sea of suicide notes i m using this to say exactly how i feel cause i know no one will see this    the last time i was genuinely happy was when i was     then my grandfather died  i was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren t the same  fast forward to  th grade my father whom i was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and i alone  then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn t trust anyone    which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause i never feel good enough and i can never fully trust them  anyways i was always socially awkward  shy and didn t have a lot of friends but i have   childhood best friends i can at least say i have but as we ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives i feel stuck    my life began to really fall apart in the fall of        my second year of college  when i began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition i have that i didn t even know about until the year before but the doctors said i shouldn t worry to much about it  due to the loss of my vision in that eye i had   eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn t work which shocked the doctors  i took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school  then in february of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away  i had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to   heal     i eventually got a job   which i hate with a passion  and became stuck    then i got into a car accident and totaled my car so now i m carless  i want to go back to school and get a new car but i feel like what s the point if i won t be able to see in a few months  everyday when i wake up before i open my eyes i think   am i going to be able to even see   it sucks because surgery won t work  i ve tried the holistic approach too and i m still just slowly losing my sight  i really took things like that for granted   my parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture i m like what s really the point     i ll have   days of me feeling like myself and happy  then it ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping i ll die  i told my mother i want to kill myself before i go completely blind because i couldn t live like that   respect to those that are blind and live cause y all are strong   even though y all can t see this  so i said i m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause i m not going into      like this  but it s like when i try to get my shit together nothing goes right  i had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job  the supervisors liked you  the employees recommended you  etc    no call back   i was supposed to get one yesterday if i got the job  that was my breaking point    that job really was a push for me to keep going but now that i didn t get it i feel stuck again  i feel like i sound stupid and dramatic and i know this is worded horribly but i guess i m just writing my jumbled thoughts out  i ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but i ve seen that there are none    if i had a gun i d just shoot myself  i looked up oding on pills but it s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up  i thought about hanging myself but i m black and i d feel weird idk lol  i think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping i ll die but i don t want to total my dads car cause that s his property  i thought about cutting myself but i ve read that that s a slow death    it s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick  or die  etc  i guess i sound like a bitch cause i want to die but i don t want to feel any pain but i guess i ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they ll be no more pain  there s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though i already said a lot  all in all i m just so tired  tired of crying myself to sleep  crying to work  crying at work  crying alone at home  and crying myself to sleep  i ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it s like i still crave human interaction that s why i feel like a fraud cause i want to be alone but i don t to feel alone    this whole thing probably doesn t even make any sense but i m just writing out my thoughts  no one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways  at first i was giving myself till the end of the year but now i m just trying to find the best method to end it  ,1
hi i went from      certain i want to kill myself to not knowing what to do    i guess its an improvement  thanks ya all that helped i would be dead by now if it wasnt for you all    im looking forward to seeing what the future will bring    cheers on ya all     ,1
humanity is the worst race to be a part of we are like enslaved cows  we are born forced to go to school to  get education  so that we can be  successful   then we must word   hours a day to be able to live peacefully and those who are out of that format are either lucky or homeless  i am too a part of that format  recently found someone that cares about me a girlfriend  but i just can find the place in my heart to like her  she is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me  im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth  adult life does not look good  at all  i dont have the guts to do it to my family thought  i just wish the world would end ,1
i want to kill myself  and people know  but they don t care  i hate myself so much  i just don t want to live anymore   ,1
im suffering constantly i just want it to end edit  id like to thank people for all the support on this post i didnt think it would get that much attention  lots of you are going through a similar thing and its nice that people understand and tell me to have hope  i of course still feel terrible but knowing there are people out there who are willing to support those going through this is great  id also like to tell anyone with negative comments on here that you really arent helpful and shouldnt be on this subreddit ,1
i m losing everything due to severe depression  i lost my job and have absolutely no money  i have bills to pay and no way to pay them  my lease is up in less than two weeks and i have no money for a new place and i haven t even started packing yet  i ve filled out countless applications and haven t heard anything  i m so scared and i don t know what to do    ,1

college is stupid and it makes me want to die even more i don t know what the fuck is wrong with my school in particular  they never even showed me how to schedule an advisor meeting  i started out with   classes and had to drop two of them because i was failing  both grades below      and these profs couldn t teach if you put a gun to their heads    now i have this whole english research paper to write on some bullshit topic i chose and we have to  collaborate  and  brainstorm  in class with people who are writing completely different papers  it s fucking stupid  they re not sharing my grade why should i have to ask for their help   i keep skipping class cause i don t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers   i think i d be happier dropping out  living with my parents  and just working two jobs so i can focus on my side hustle  it s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me i m wasting the opportunity they gave me    i don t know  i just know i can t take this shit anymore  ,1
i don t want to die  but i no longer want to exist  there is no point to this  society has made it almost impossible to not live in a damn cycle of work come home  get   hours to yourself  go to sleep  and then you get to do it again   if that s all there is  why even continue on  i m never getting married or having kids  for personal reasons  so i don t have a responsibility to continue on either  but i know i could never kill myself  which makes it even harder  i know there will be no relief for the pain i feel every god damn day  i m jealous of everyone who is content living like a damn robot slaved to society doing the exact same thing everyday  i wish i could be happy doing that  but i just feel like i m wasting my damn life away  ,1
i just tried to strangle myself with a rope because i have nowhere to hang myself at the moment so i just tied it around my neck and pulled it and i could still breathe so it didn t work   i want to kill myself right now but i even fail at that   what is wrong with me     ,1
i just told my parents im suicidal now im going to get some professional help  wish me luck please ,1
i am ending my life tonight tonight  i m finally ending it all after    years of living   i was neglected by my mother when i was an infant  her neglect and inattentiveness led to me being sexually abused by my caretaker  this has led to many psychological problems such as ptsd  depression  anxiety  ocd and borderline personality disorder  i have wanted to die since i was   years old  i see no hope in living anymore    i ruin all my relationships  the love of my life broke up with me a month ago  in a state of despair  i hooked up with random men to fill the void  my ex said he would never get back together with me if i slept with other people  i see no point in living  i m an abusive pile of shit who isn t capable of being loved because i hurt the people i love most  i have been in therapy for years and i continue to be a fucking monster    i ordered refills for medication i have been hoarding  tonight  i m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and i  i am going to end it all tonight  there s no point in living if my brain will never be fixed  there s no point in being alive if i m a terrible human being who never even had a chance  this is my last goodbye  ,1
its       and im gonna kill myself at midnight  not here to be talked out of it  just wanted to say something anonymously i guess  i just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways  sure not as shitty as some others have it  but its all shitty  i was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that  i was always meant to die alone  i tried to avoid it but by    it became clear the path i was going down   more importantly  i just never was happy with myself or life in general  losing loved ones  losing touch with friends and never making new ones  being bored with the work i chose but having no interest in going back to school  life is just not worth it to me  lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside  i said if i wasnt feeling better by    id end it  and here i am  ill miss my family but im done  being strong for others   time to take care of myself   i chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick  yeah i know  you might screw up  but oh well  thats a risk ill take  oh and im sure someone will show up to tell me ill go to hell like they always do to people here  and yeah  im shaking in my boots    lol   holy shit     minutes now as i write this  im scared obviously but also excited  itll finally be done   good luck everyone no matter your situation  if you choose to keep going i hope you end up better than i did  bye  ,1

does anyone else feel like they have to commit suicide to get revenge on the people that hurt me  to tell the world i am not gonna put up with its crap  and to that i have to do it to ask the world to solve the problems i am facing for others  i have been suicidal ever since my grandparents passed away several years ago  i dont have much family  i feel like i need to kill myself to escape that pain because it cant be solved because you cant bring dead people back from the dead  and i feel like if i kill myself i can leave a note to tell the world to solve this problem for others  i am estranged from the family i do have and i feel like i need to kill myself to let them know they have hurt me  i hate how i dont have a big family  lots of friends  dont have a good job or are rich  and dont get to go on vacations  people disrespect me  i feel like if i kill myself i can tell the world that i am not gonna put up with its unfairness    would me commuting suicide and writing a detailed note change the world    i hate how people think of mental health issues when they think of suicide when they dont think of lonliness or lack of family casting it    i know some peopme say that family doesnt have to be blood but someone will always tell me when i say that  blood is thicker than water   maybe this will tell the people that say that i wont put up with that bullcrap  ,1
hey santa  all i want for christmas is to fall asleep and never wake up   ,1
no one will ever love me no friends  no girlfriend and i doubt ill get any  i get so little attention in my life that i seek some orange arrows and empty comments from strangers on the internet  i have nothing to live for  i just waste my life more and more everyday  i will never achieve anything  no one will miss me and i have no one to miss  i dont even like my family    my savings is my timer  i have been jobless for   months now  and once my savings are dried up im  going to kill myself  ive already tried killing myself before  but i will make sure to finish the job next time  i would rather be dead and continue living in this worthless life  i look forward to using the rest of my money  i find peace knowing i wont he here for much longer  im too tired to continue trying    so to the few of you that actually read this  good luck  youll need it in this fucked up world  i hope you find a reason to live  ,1
not even really depressed   simply realized that the way reality is constructed just doesn t suit me i would probably kill myself if it wasn t unfair to the people that love me  i don t have any specific problems  successful with all the things that i do but i just don t like doing all the things you have to do to live  i don t like living and it s pointless  one the one hand i cannot destroy the lives of my parents and affect my friends in such a tragic way on the other hand i hate existing  what should i do  ,1
sleeping and dreaming is the only enjoyment i get daily  anymore each day i wake up as i near closer to     i feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week    it s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where i am now  to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself  i have no direction  i have no college education  my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless  giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded  at times to perform adequately   i have a relationship  i suppose i am better for it  but each day i wake up  i feel as though every moment i try to engage with my partner  i bring him down in my depression  it seems only too much  the burden of my love  i feel i m just too heavy a weight on those around me    i have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries  simple things like helping around the house    perhaps my issue is my mental illness i have yet to be diagnosed with  but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort    the crushing debt of sadness i get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness i can achieve is simply that  a dream   it is selfish  but i lose my will to live more and more  i care little about actually dying  it seems the only person i am afraid to hurt is my beloved  but i fear i can t stay suffering like this much longer  worrying about money  my worth  the pain of simply living  it has been months coming that i have been wasting away    exercise only distracts my heart when i have someone with me  and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins  so much so before we finish the outing   calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards  but i try my best to hang on  if only out of love for my fiancé   i feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now  i am still young  but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind  i can t enlighten myself to give much more  i feel   i feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand  as i can t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back    i don t know when i will do it  but i try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year  but i sense as though i may not make it to the end of this month  ,1
 it will get better  being the biggest lie ive been told  i desire suicide  i currently suffer from borderline personality disorder  clinical depression and general anxiety  and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants  which i believe wouldnt help my already too far gone mindset   im crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks  getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long ive slept  struggling to shower and get myself clean  suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days  or even just sitting up in my bed   i lay there for hours upon waking up  lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until i feel sick  staring blankly at my tv which is almost never turned off   i never leave my room  i store bottles of water and food by my bed so i can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of xbox and minor interaction with the outside world  i hardly have the stomach to face my housemates  ignore every phone call  mute every messaging service i use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before i would be able to push them away with made up situations i create with them in fear of abandonment  i fear rejection  i push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so i can say i wasnt the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones i love out for no proper reason is the very definition of  fucked up   what surprises people the most is the fact that i am well aware that i have friends  i am well aware that i have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life  i am well aware that i need help   i am not in denial   but im made to believe im a selfish wreck for wanting to die  im made to believe im a dumbass for not getting help  all the offers of support and ignoring them so i look fucking stupid despite telling people i just  cant  i dont have the energy anymore  like  i just cant  i had goals in life  i dreamt of a sober  healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship  not being unemployed and relying on benefits because im simply too damaged to work a proper job  just being happy  unfortunately  a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell  knowing youll have these illnesses for the rest of your life  risking your relationships with your friends and family  your significant other  and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction  i couldnt tell you whats worse  so far  i found someone i wanted a long lasting relationship with  we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and bpd making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much  he faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing  the validation seeking  the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up  we had a   month break and things returned to the way they were  but once again i destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations i made up in my head  im deeply in love with this person and i struggle to see it work out anymore unless i fix myself but im beyond help and dont know how i would even fix myself at this point   i have given up   i am tired   i wanted to fix myself to prove to him that i could be the best person i could possibly be  love him the way he deserves to be loved  and prove to him just how sorry i am for the drama and hurt i caused him  the verbal abuse  the drunken abuse  i look back at the things i did and i just struggle to live a day to day life knowing i caused so much hurt to the person ive loved so deeply since i met him  the person i would give so much for  to bend over backwards just to see him smile  all i think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that ill probably never experience these things with him again because im so broken  friendship with this person is hard  and im deeply saddened that i cant tell him just how i feel  it has driven me to believing id be better off dead so i cant hurt him anymore  i also wanted to fix myself for my family  my friends   for myself  things could be so good right now if i wasnt such a horrible person  so far all ive ever done is created problems for everyone that ive ever loved everyone thats ever loved me and i cant stand this life anymore  im so fucking sad and im sick of hurting everyone i love   i am unlovable and dont deserve friends   this may be it for me  reddit  this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles   i have a strong desire for suicide right now  and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems   i dont think anything could save me now    mum would be devastated  and who knows if anyone in my circle of friends would care  and i love my mother but i am in pain  ,1
  m can i tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts without him telling my parents  i don t want to go to a mental hospital  edit  i talked to my therapist and he told me he is going to tell my parents  i appreciate everyone trying to help me  but i just don t see things getting better  ,1
anyone else ever feel like suicide gives them hope  i feel like its the only way ill ever be able to escape the hell im slowly creating for myself  ,1

it honestly feels like people hate me on first sight doesn t matter if it s in person or online where i m nothing but a username  i m actually feeling like i m insane and that i ve done some heinous cat against society that i ve just forgotten and that s why people don t like me  even if it s a first impression  before i ve said literally anything  i am instantly disliked   to be honest though  i would fucking hate myself too for no reason  if they got to know me they would only hate me    x more ,1

does anyone else feel like they are  meant  to kill themselves  i have this weird feeling that i have to kill myself  as i was always going to kill myself  it feels sort of prophetic  like thats what this life had in store for me  i dont know its strange  anyone else feel this way  ,1
it just costs too much to live i can t handle poverty any more  everything is too expensive  i m afraid to use my heat this winter because the electric bill would be too much  i have a radiator and a pile of blankets  but if i don t run the heat the pipes will freeze and i can t pay to fix that if they burst    i don t wanna live because all i do is pay bills  there s no enjoyment in my life  just constant stress and worry and fear that i ll end up homeless    everything is a struggle  i have to strategically be late on certain bills so the service doesn t get shut off but i can pay one thing while i neglect another  interest on my loans and credit cards makes it so i don t seem to make progress paying anything back    i just can t take it anymore  ,1
im surprised with how comfortable the thought of suicide has gotten with me and it scares me  the thought of taking my own life has become surprisingly more comfortable normal   it scares me  i have thought of it before but it was always   im never going to actually do that   but now its been cnsuming my thoughts more and more  i feel i have nothing   no one  no purpose  im useless  i have no where to turn  the silence is deafening and the thought of taking my life just creeps up more and more and it doesnt feel so crazy anymore  this is what scares ne to se ehow my thinking has changed and maybe in a month itll be the only thing i think of  it seems im going that direction i dont know what to really do   i tell nyself im being selfish and i have family that cares for me and theyll be sad but its not convincing me anymore  i just hate how lonely i feel  i look around and think what am i doing  im fooling myself  i try to be happy and joke around with others  tell myself its all in my head but i feel im losing control   im scared   edit  sorry lots of grammar and spelling errors  im on an old phone thats a little hard to fix ,1

my boyfriend comes from   generations of suicide  he took his life in november       i am really fucking depressed  we have a   year old daughter  i feel ill every moment of every day  he was my best friend  i have constant nightmares  we struggled so much after his death   i got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town  i battled with her school because she got called to the principle s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at christmas because she missed her daddy  that student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter   she has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms  the rumor went around that her dad died from a drug overdose  he hung himself  and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us    i worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best i could  i found every resource possible for her  but i didn t take any time for myself i guess  my family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death   my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her dad s funeral   it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter  my mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings  she also doesn t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her dad s side of her family  she got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her dad s family over her  which is ridiculous  after her dad s death  i brought my daughter to her dad s family  across country  my mom flipped out and called child protective services on me  she can t handle not having control over my daughter   so i ve been battling with child protective  my mom filed for custody of my daughter  there have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on dhs and they aren t fucking around with anything  so even though i m an amazing mother  have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief   i ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me  if you thought those upity moms judged us then  you should see how they judge us now   i m done with it all  my daughter is now a stranger to me  it s been   months without her and i really have no purpose in life anymore  i mean  i know my worth but being involved with the state and system rips your entire soul up    i have no fucking purpose to live  i understand why her dad left  i want to leave also   ,1
have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someones suicide  now i did not personally know this guy  i left my towns school in  th grade  and he moved to my town about a year or two after so i never went to school with him but i knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town  anyway  i am    now  a few days ago  i started seeing people posting  rip  statuses on social media  and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not  apparently  he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough  at first i felt bad  and i still do  but then i started to feel really jealous  because since i was    i have been clinically depressed and have tried so  so many times in the past decade to kill myself  but it was never successful at it  and not a day has gone by that i havent wanted to be dead  and apart of me is thinking  its not fair that he got to die and im still here   has anyone else ever felt like this  ,1
im this fucking close to ending it     m  really really really long  sorry  might be graphic  might get offended  discretion advised  idk  first of all  i dont know if i need or even want help  maybe i just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me  i honestly dont know what im doing right now other than venting  my  life story  might come out as very very long but its the only way i can express and explain what im going through right now  i cant just do a tl dr for this   just to make things clear  my father is an abusive  manipulative  psychopathic  wife beater  piece of shit  i was am not abused with the sack of shit  but my mother has been physically  mentally  emotionally  and financially abused   here we go  some parts obscured    i was born to international parents  as in they are both different nationalities  upper middle class to lower upper class  not  rich  because my father doesnt understand how credit cards  loans  mortgages or saving money works  ive moved plenty of times more than i count on my two hands  living in   different countries including birth country  i will refer to them as country             in order of moving   i lived in my birth country    for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where i genuinely could smile and have fun  i would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital fairly small town   we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school  we would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena  we were in the same drama theater class  yeah i know   we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts  we went to the same schools  same sports clubs  same nearly everything  it was the only time where i would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day  and sleep at night without worrying about anything  i didnt notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when i would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while i tired to sleep at night  now that i think about it  the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her  even if i try to remember the fun times i had with forgotten names and faces  it all gets overwritten by the horrors i witnessed   my father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country   which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother  despite the sudden transfer  my mother and i agreed to go because my grandparents were there  and just a couple of hours away  my father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas  my mother and i were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland  but that excitement faded when we got to the airport  my asshole of a father didnt even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a   year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language  we managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldnt get in because we didnt have the security key  the clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment   th floor   that alone just shows the attitude my father had back then  since i could somewhat speak and understand the local language  my mother wanted me to go to a local school so i could hone on my language skills  but the school choice was unlucky  the majority of the students there were nice  but the teachers and administration were utter shit  they were plenty of  fights  everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldnt give a shit to actually punish the students enough  i have to admit that i was in some of them as well  nothing too serious  but enough to get me in  trouble  as well  a bunch of parents couldnt take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there  it was a real shame because i actually quite liked my classmates there  excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me  but still  after that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but i got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff  i made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports  and since the student population was so small i was friendly with mostly everyone  however  i was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point  gets important later   it was at this time when i had actual thoughts of suicide  my friends and i started to get into rooftopping climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building  taking pictures etc  and unlike the others  i liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below  the thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if i walked of the ledge  i wouldnt have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain i would feel was when i hit the ground hard  unbeknownst to my friends  i would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not  but i never could because i couldnt leave my mother to that scumbag   oh did i tell you what my father was doing during this time  after the first couple of weeks of being in country    my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed  for   years  he would occasionally  emphasis on occasionally  leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which i guess was  living expenses  because my mother didnt work  and my father doesnt understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses  i never knew about any mental conditions legit depression  my mother has had until recently but my mother and i would sometimes go to a therapist  where all i did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed  i had no clue at the time  but i always regret not knowing sooner   after a few years in country    my father got transferred to country   which i wasnt as excited about because then i would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the      fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it  we got there about when i was around     i dont remember completely but by then i was completely shut in and didnt let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood  i was the new kid with a funny cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time i opened my mouth and had to explain i was born in country   and so on  this added to my already shy demeanor because i didnt want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father  i never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room  never hung out with the wrong crowd  never did alcohol or drugs  never got into fights  hell i barely even talked  answered questions when only needed  didnt show any emotions unless absolutely necessary  and that changed me  i started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do correct me if im wrong im not a doctor   i would lie to people to get them to do what i want  i e  snitch on each other  get people to fight  get out of trouble myself  get better grades in some classes  i even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers  i couldnt care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks  i eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff i had wasnt really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning  i also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where i was at  during my   or   years of being in country    my father would beat my mother so many times i started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and i would barely get any sleep from fear  my heart rate would go up and i would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because i got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother  my fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever i was around because ive put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him i cant use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady  fat absorbs punches   no offense to overweight people   and im not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face id rather break a bat on a skull    now onto recent events  my father transferred again to country   where we currently reside in  he actually got here about a year ago  whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before covid    got big  the reason why my mother and i got here a year late because there were  problems with immigration  most likely my father just delaying us coming here because hes a dick  we had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about   years of schooling i left half way through in country   and different curriculum different term semester dates messed things up    i was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to country    i started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and i am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before       i started to become a neet the japan definition i e  shut in   all i would do is watch netflix and youtube  play some games on steam im not a big gamer guy   sleep and eat during the day  and then sneak out at midnight and drink  smoke cigarettes   hang out with some sketchy guys  ride motorbikes till sunrise  and repeat  i regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group i was with  i didnt do it because i didnt want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes  i cut ties with them after i got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again  i know what they and i did were lawfully and morally  wrong  but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself  either way  i found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump  one time a social worker volunteer was  patrolling  the rooftop i was on  apparently it was  popular   and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot  what she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as  help   my death would just be another number in a news story  what about your loved ones  what other paths could you take  that sort of thing  after that encounter i stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how i feel  but it didnt really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself  i dont want to die painfully  before i could do anything though  my mother and i were finally able to move to country     that brings us here less than   months before me writing this post  as usual all i did was do a bit of online courses  watch some netflix and youtube  play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven  eat when i feel like it  sleep when i feel like it  cry a ton  contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment  then deciding not to because i dont want to die in this country  then rinse and repeat  since i was home all day  i only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too  tired  from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is  since he knows i can beat his ass easily  he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where i quickly put him down with some elbows to the head i had watched some ufc illegal moves compilation   everything was  fine  up until covid    started to hit hard and became a global pandemic  my father is a manager of sorts  so he is now working from home      and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all time high  today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where i just couldnt stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating  i nearly fully snapped but i started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but i had hesitated because i didnt want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country  i know im smart arrogant but somewhat true  so i laid off and am now writing this post   as you could probably tell  the reason why i havent killed myself or the wife beating piece of shit yet is because of my mother  i love her to death and wouldnt want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father  or have to deal with a murdering son whos wanted by the cops  i also know that despite the piece of shit being a piece of shit  hes willing to pay the                 usd  of schooling for   years of ib which i will be attending in august if the economy doesnt die and the world doesnt end by then  i know that if i work hard during those   years of ib  i could get into colleges and universitys i would have never even thought of attending  the logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then ill be free to do what i want  but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything  im a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way i have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother  but its just getting too much for me to handle  im so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but im equally as close to just ending it all   like i said  i dont know if im here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going  or just someone to talk to  i dont know  just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post  i just dont know   edit  thanks to all who read and responded  i just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton  im feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments   to those who might be a bit confused  ive begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times  my mother just brushes me off and says shes in this for me  despite who he really is  he is making bank  and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college university he didnt go  military and   s   the reason why i havent gone to any sort of authority help yet is because i dont want to waste my mothers time enduring the past    or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful  believe me  i have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future  she wants me to get a good education  get a well paying job  have a family  and treat them differently than the way my mother and i have been treated  and ultimately be happy  the way i see it  she has sacrificed her life and i dont want to make that sacrifice go in vain  this is the only reason why i havent gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet  sometimes i beat myself up with shame because the reason logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me  ,1
i don t want to kill myself  but i still want to die  i just give up  there s no light at the end of the tunnel  it won t get better  i can t just get through this bit    that s what people always say  they ve been telling me things will get better for years  well they haven t yet and they never will  because i don t fucking try to improve my own life  because i don t care  because i deserve to suffer   the voices came back strong  i m starting to agree with them more and more  they re right  he doesn t care  no one does  there is no way to get better  no one wants to help  no one will    you can t make it better  so why try  i m not even good enough to kill myself  i can t do anything  i just want it to take me  i give up on even trying  i m just going to walk awayand let it take me  ,1

i have never had affection in my life  respect or trust  and i was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over    years  suddenly  my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option  some backstory is needed here   im a girl  in my   s  who never had friends  and never had affection basic respect from the whole family and people or a normal life  taken for granted and bullied in school   i was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesnt like my gender   nearly killed by her and from the day i started noticing the gaslighting i also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers  with people justifying my mothers insaneness even when it happened in front of them        telling me it was my fault and  you are the one who drove her to kill you  you made her miserable    literally the only people i can speak to is my psychologist and web friends  either because i am      alone and because i cant even start talking  the only times i hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family   my only way out is a job  my short term memory is mostly gone so i cant study  i tried  failed  had to leave uni  and i have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isnt survival   so here i am  familyless  friendless  without an identity  without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life  without a future that i look forward to   in all of this  my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an objective solution  as the only one  i am scared of this unconsciius thought  if your situation was like mine and you got out of it  im listening   thank you in advance     p s  i see many of you contacted me privately  but thats a lot of you  so dont be upset if i cant answer  i appreciate  ,1

am i faking being depressed for attention  i at this point have started to doubt if im just doing everything for attention  i do things like venting to close friends when im feeling way too deep down  i sometimes just want to see if they care because a lot of my  thoughts  surround the fact that nobody actually cares about me  that everybody hates me  sometimes ive gotten  mad  at people for acting like they dont care  because everyone says they care but never shows it  i get mad about the fact that they pretend they care cause if they dont  they should just tell me that  cause deep inside its what i want  so i can prove to myself that im the failure i believe i am  so i can finally kill myself without the guilt  im very confused  am i faking it   ,1
i m killing myself by the end of this week i wanted to do it tonight but as i type this  i m realizing again it s my older brothers birthday  i don t want his birthday to be a never ending memory of his    year old sister killing herself on the same day   i m scared  i know that there s never an easy way to kill yourself  not unless your assisted but even then it s not easy especially when it s illegal  i think i might overdose  i m just scared of throwing up  maybe that makes me stupid  a coward and stupidly suicidal   i m really done  i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit  i mean  i ve been diagnosed with severe depression  different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years  and didn t think much of it  until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was far from normal so i tried to get help  why wait   months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping  if i can just kill myself in those three months  there s no point to anything anymore  i have no reason to live  besides  i ve tried to kill myself twice already   though  they obviously didn t work    third times a charm  right   edit  i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down  im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted  i m tired of being abused  i m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family  i don t want pity  i really am just tired  i m scared of myself and the future ,1

it feels weird when i remember that suicide is such a scary thing for most people to discuss  i keep forgetting that most people arent suicidal  and that even the slightest mention of it can make them panic  at this point ive been suicidal for so long that its just part of my life  it feels like you have your job  your hobbies  etc  and your suicidal thoughts  apparently not for most people though   anytime anyone ever finds out that im suicidal  im actually pretty surprised by how much of a reaction it inspires in them  ,1

i drove to the gun store   parked   and drove back home was having such a hard time with depression  i made the decision i was going to go to the gun store and kill myself the next day  last night   woke up   took a shower   got dressed and built up the courage to go    i got in the car and put the nearest gun shop in my gps  not playing any music whatsoever on my ride there  total silence for the    minute drive  mind racing    mph  i parked next to the store and was trembling with fear   there it was the gun store  i tried to unlock my seatbelt and my hand was shaking  i was able to unlock my seatbelt   but that was it  i didn t have the strength to get out the car and go inside  i ended up crying and calling my cousin asking if i could spend a few days at his house because i m at a low point and i live all by myself  he said of course and so i turned the car back on drove back home packed a bag and headed to his house   i m here at his house now and we just got dinner with his kids  i still feel like utter shit and want to die but something in me wouldn t let me pull the trigger   no pun intended   a small voice in my head is proud of me       but i m still fighting this war of suicidal ideation and depression constantly and i feel like i m losing   just had to share with someone  ,1
telling me to exercise and pick up a hobby does not make me less suicidal than i already am  don t feed me cliche bullshit  i get it  there is nothing else that anybody can say to fix your past traumas that leak into the present or your ongoing troubles  i m just sick of being told generic bullshit   fall back on old hobbies    what are your interests    does it ever occur to you that when i m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation  it s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore  i no longer have a  hobbies anymore or  b  no energy to carry out those hobbies  telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when i m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if i do  i m afraid of what i m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts  why am i afraid  i don t fear death in itself but i fear dying  the pain involved in dying  the agony  the fear of it not working  telling me to  oh eat your favourite food   doesn t fucking help  i have no appetite and i unintentionally starve myself  when i try to eat the smallest amount  i can t help but almost vomit  time doesn t heal all and i hate being told that it does  shit has gotten worse over time and i m sick of people saying you have to have patience  says fucking who  i don t have to do shit and even then i did for the sake of other people  not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact  we aren t always going to get closure  some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that s how it just fucking is  whether you admit it or not  not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that s the harsh truth of reality  don t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature  looking at a bunch of leaves won t magically make me not want to kill myself and won t cure fucking anything  i need proper help but there s nothing out there aside from  discover your interests   who the fuck cares  that s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it  not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it  irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything  cliche as fuck  i hate this life  i wish i was dead  nobody gives a shit until then anyway  nobody takes anyone seriously until you re dead and even then  they forget about you within a while anyway and don t tell me that isn t true  they do  because it s human nature to be able to grieve and move on  it s within our innate tendencies to do so  fuck this  life   living and exisiting are two very different things  living means to feel alive and i m purely existing   alive  in the sense that i m breathing but i m dead inside  please let me fucking go  ,1

getting bullied for painful crippling disease  going to gun stores regularly when i was in the   th grade i started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs  i immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal  every few months i would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past   years i have been getting worse every few months   my disease has become so severe that i cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment  i can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight i can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath  i cannot leave the house in the summer the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain  and controlling symptoms   several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable   so for the past few weeks i have been visiting gun shops while i lie to my parents and tell them i am going to the gym   everyone treats me like crap especially my parents   my body has reached its physical limits  i cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible  so i am going to buy guns and kill myself  ,1
the first day after is really weird  tw  suicide attempt  so last night i tried to kill myself  i had every intention on doing so  i was sitting in my car with my gun to my chin and i pulled the trigger but nothing happened  i usually keep a round in the chamber when i carry  so didnt think to rack the slide  instead i just cocked the hammer back  for whatever reason  maybe it was because i wasnt thinking straight  i never racked it after loading the magazine  so when i pulled the trigger  no bullet came out  and it was the loudest click i have ever heard in my life  o drove home and gave my roommate  who is also my best friend  my gun and i told him what happened  i cried  he cried  and he asked me to sleep in his bed with him so he would know i was there  i dont know how but i managed to sleep  but now  everything just feels off  i cant look people in the face  its hard to concentrate at work  i dont know what to say to anyone  i wasnt supposed to be here today  people are telling me go to a doctor  but i dont want to  ive been through that before and it doesnt help  if youre reading this  thank you  i just needed a place where i could say what happened and not be judged or baker acted or something  ,1
constantly flooded with memories and thoughts of every mistake in my life  i just want to sleep but i can t  every time i close my eyes it s something shitty that s happened to me or something shitty or stupid that i ve done   said   so i sit awake and cry and panic and i can t function   my mental health has always been a disaster but it really feels like non stop deterioration at this point   i hate that i never have anything new to say  i can t articulate anything so it s just the same old  i don t want to be here anymore why can t i get the guts to end it already  over and over   i m so miserable and so tired of being alone   i know that i have love and good in my heart to give to people but i m so fucking stupid i just can t talk to anyone   i know it s never going to end until i do it  i know i will never meet someone who will stay  i know there s no point  i just want to die  ,1
do you ever wonder how other people aren t suicidal  i find it hard to believe that there are actually people out there who like themselves and enjoy life and don t want to kill themselves  wow   ,1
we re selfish for wanting to die  but other people aren t selfish for wanting us to stay alive when we have no drive or real reason to fight the temptation   ,1

i am a loser  a big failure and forever will be  i have always been unable to talk with people  ive had no friends ever  fuck i cant even talk to most of my family  i didnt think much of it when i was younger  but now im going to college and its hitting me hard how much of a failure i am  i dropped out of my first one because of crippling anxiety  now i joined another one far from home  now i feel trapped  im scared of humans  i look at myself in the mirror and i see an ugly subhuman being unworthy of any love or respect  i know if i go on i wont be a success in life  i wont be happy  i will always be scared of everything and depressed all the time  my mind is too fucked up over the years that i dont think its even possible to cure  all i can think of now is death  it gives me relief to think of it  so i will soon drive off into a lake and die and hopefully make it look like an accident   edit  thanks for all the kind words guys  even though i dont know a single one of you  it feels good that some of you can understand what ive been going through all my life and took the time to respond to me  ,1
i wish humanity would burn to ashes  i hate society and its concepts of virtue and success   its telling that its taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things   suddenly  some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home   standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended  almost like theyve finally realized there are more important things on the line  not that that matters to me  because im a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience   carbon emissions have dramatically decreased  dont know the full facts  but ive heard that air quality in notorious places like china is actually somewhat breathable now   so i hate when people tell me things like how it gets better  or how im going to be successful  everyone beats around the bush  no one wants to admit that im a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything  i wish humanity would burn to ashes   i dropped out of college   years ago and ive been living with my parents since then  i have no job and dont really do much from day to day  about the only passion i have in life is video games  and ive recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of rpgs on a personal blog  of course  because i dont know shit about promoting it  its never going to take off in views and ill never be able to actually take that passion anywhere   so  as someone whos dead weight right now  this pandemic is essentially what ive wanted  a disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt  so i dont have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job   and yet it hasnt changed a thing for me  i still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things  im still useless  i still have no future  with each passing day  the feeling that im running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger   the funny thing is that i see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games  ironically  thats the life ive always wanted  if i didnt have to worry about things like school  grades  finding a job  and so on  i could live at my own pace  id read more books  learn random interesting topics  immerse myself into human culture  and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming  and you could argue that i could do all of that stuff right now since im not attending school and dont have a job  but the constant internal reminder that im a waste of resources stops me from doing that  the thought process is that im going to kill myself in the future anyways  so why bother   i was so close to the finish line  one of my current  obligations   if you can call it that  is that ive pre ordered two copies of the upcoming final fantasy vii remake  one for myself  and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldnt pre order it himself for certain reasons  the plan was that once that favor was done  and once ive gotten a chance to finish the game myself  i could finally let myself die       would be the final chapter to my pathetic story  there were lots of other games that im excited for this year that i was willing to give up on waiting for because i wanted to kill myself before june   but this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me  the shelter at home orders mean that im never going to be completely alone in the house  so i cant just attempt a suicide without any huge risks  and even if i did pull it off  the last thing id want is for the funeral corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak   the one silver lining is that ill now get a chance to play upcoming games like xenoblade definitive edition and trails of cold steel iv before the time comes for me to kill myself  but im not sure that means much when im a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me  as well as the general sense that im trapped in a corner because im a college dropout with no job  no future  and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide   i hate the fact that i always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words  too  ive been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down  why is it that i have so much that i want to bitch about sometimes  yet when i have the opportunity to write or speak about it  the words simply evaporate like dry ice   deep down  i secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that im useless  rude  and toxic  to me  finally hearing someone tell me that im a bad person will make it feel like i finally have permission to die  ,1
 i hope my death makes more sense than my life   quote from joker  feeling depressed today  bipolar is a bitch  felt like sharing  ,1
a thing about me  please  if you have the time  please read it  i just want to let things out  im posting this here because i just need a place to scream  sometimes  i wonder if im just not built for this world  if maybe im not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe i should just take my life because i feel like i cant accomplish anything   anyways  hi  my name is autumn  im    y o transgirl and i graduated high school last year  as far as im aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct i have borderline personality disorder  aspergers syndrome  generalized anxiety disorder  and adhd  ive always had a hard time growing up  i was bullied so much in school  my parents werent the best  they physically abused me when i was a child  and mentally abused me in middle high school  a part of me doesnt hate them  at least my mother  because i feel like theyre not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me  they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me  they just decided to go the  old school  route of hitting me until i got better grades  anyways  i hate my father  hes a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and i wish he would just disappear    anyways  onto my personal life with friends  i am severely emotionally unstable  i experience things in extremes and i always constantly split between loving and hating my friends  i constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations  i selfharm  i spend so much money  haha  i had a job with an income of    k monthly without any bonus commission  but id spend all of it on everything  i cant control it  i always ended up burning bridges with my friendships  i didnt mean to  i dont want to  but i cant control my behaviors and i hate it  im trying real hard to go to therapy  im hoping i can start dbt to help me with my bpd  borderline personality disorder    i just want to have friends i interact with on a regular basis and play games with  i try my best to reach out but i guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me  which can really hurt i guess  one recent thing ive really gotten into is ffxiv  i try to ask other friends to play but  i just get ignored and such  it hurts a lot  i dont hate them i think  i dont  i just  i wish i had friends they have and play with  it gets really boring and lonely  aside from those things  sometimes  i wonder if everything would be better if i was dead  you see  i never knew escapism existed until a few months ago  and thats when i realized how for the past    years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world ive created in my head was extremely unhealthy  and because of it i dont see any reason in going on  i think whats stopping me now is how ill informed i am with taking my own life and how afraid i am of coming out with permanent damage and not death  aside from that  there are   other people whom i love very much and cant bear to leave alone  my dream job is to edit videos for a youtube channel or do something game grumps esque with a friend  id love that so much  but thats just a dream  given the current state of youtube and everything like that  the chances are thats not going to happen  sometimes i just wish i could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams   anyways  thanks for letting me rumble a bit  im not happy  im not okay  i dont want to be alive  but maybe i can make it through  i just sometimes wish i had friends like others i see  but im extremely shy and suck at conversation and such  its really hard  i think im going to go cry some more now  ill see you all some other time    if you took the time to read through all this  thank you    from the bottom of my heart  ,1

the annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion if anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it  id strongly urge them to not read any further because i would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone  im a miserable  wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that i can poke holes of rationality in   i fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide support  the hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me  in a strange way i think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like  youre not the only one going through this  or  you have so much to live for  or  things will get better   i imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that theyre momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all  for gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like im a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something   if youll bear with me and be patient  let me explain myself  were all fully realized  functioning adults here  we dont get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up  we dont need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us  youre not alone  we understand   before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again  what is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life  the reason were in this fucking mess here is because of people in our own lives  tragedies in our own lives  failures  loss  heartbreak  devastation  clinical  depression that you cant afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it  the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts    i wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here  it is incredibly short sighted  offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory  i wish people would just say  you know what  i hear you  i get it  you do what you need to   because that to me is exponentially more empathetic  meaningful  profound and compassionate than the typical  no youre wrong  stop what youre doing  think of everyone who will miss you  bullshit approach   thats even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help  im literally dying here  dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony  i physically cannot even cry any more because im so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before  the only reason i get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off    times a day for the temporary    second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice  and a stranger has the audacity to tell me that its entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to  do you see whats inherently fucked up about that  its not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldnt understand         of your suicide note if you left them one  its not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit  of your friends who havent noticed anything was wrong in over   years and who wouldnt ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up  theres nobody  its all you  you alone are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk  you weigh    pounds  your hair is falling out  your teeth are loose  it is your responsibility to seek help    let me give you a hypothetical  lets say that the very problem that i have is that i have nobody in my life who would want to talk to me of their own accord  thats my problem   that nobody wants to talk to me  then how is the solution to that problem to pay somebody to talk to me  that simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point  that even a designated  helper  will only talk to me if i incentivize them with money  and so the problem persists  i dont want a shrink  i dont want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world  i just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say  damn dude  shit sounds rough  i honestly dont know what id do if i were in your position  if you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have   i guess youve probably already considered every other alternative  you do you  godspeed   that would mean the world to me  that would be such a pure  profound  refreshingly objective thought  and that would help more than any of the other sugar coated infantile nonsense   were fucking people  we still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on reddit and navigate to suicide watch and type a post here  were not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when were gone  some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all  some off our corpses wont be discovered for months because were just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we dont answer our phones a couple of times  some of us are only still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone  theyd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in    i dont know man  ive rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point  i just wish people didnt have such a simplistic view of things  its not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say  hey dont be sad  and theyll be like  omg wow  i never saw it that way before  im all better now    you cant go up to a suicidal person and say  hey  dont kill yourself   itd be so much better if you could say  hey  i get it  im sorry  maybe nobody in your life will miss you  i probably wont miss you either  but i do hope you make it out of this sometime   ,1
only staying alive for others at this point my mother is everything to me  if i was to kill myself it would destroy her  she lost her husband last year and im basically the only thing she lives for now    im basically a failure at life  im    years old  only ever had   temporary jobs  never had a girlfriend  i have some friends but none of them would consider me as their best friend  even though i consider them as mine    in society  my family are seen as outcasts and people act as if we are beneath them  i feel like a failure to my mother when shes speaking to somebody in public as ive achieved nothing in my lifetime    these thoughts enter my head daily  i want a way out but i couldnt do it to my family  if theres ever a purpose for my death or a situation where i may need to die in place of someone else  im taking it  ,1
i love you all you guys are practically my second family  even though we share the same pain  you guys have no idea how much you help not only me but many others that goes through these thoughts  this sub has prevented me from ending it many times  just knowing that whenever i feel sad i can come here and relate to so many people and people are whiling to help you  is really overwhelming  so thank you all for being awesome  hopefully one day we can find peace  even if it seams cloudy and rainy outside  ,1

i m currently looking at train tracks from a bridge one moment i am so ready to throw myself on those tracks  the next the fear comes in and i m terrified  i ve been standing here for about an hour  i don t know how much longer i ll be here  it is terrifying but the urge to just get it over with is so strong  i ve waited so long for things to change and it just seems like it s not going to happen for me  i would rather not have to live in agony every day  i wish there was an easier way to do this  i m just waiting for a fast enough train to come along so i ll be sure it ll be instant  but i m scared  edit   i m still here  i was too scared to do it ,1
ive meticulously planned everything to the last detail  but whenever they ask me if i have a plan i say no such a useless question  you can spend    minutes talking about how much you wanna die but if you answer no to that one question they dont think its serious  if you do say yes they take all your stuff and lock you in a room where youre nothing but a barcode  a literal barcode on your wrist  that they can scan to make sure your misery is expensive enough     then you lie your way out and go back to the world feeling the exact same way at best  but more likely a lot worse     mental health care is an absolute joke  its literally just trial and error and if anyone says differently theyre lying  not only that but theyre incentivized to make it take as long as possible so healthcare companies make more money     doctors have been throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for   years for me and nothing has  no medicine  therapy  group  whatever  literally nothing has worked and nothing will    i wanna just throw all my bullshit waste of money meds in the trash  hop in my car and drive across the country and kill myself there if i have to  ,1

my suicide note     i don t feel as if i need to really explain much  you knew i was suffering    admittedly or not  you knew    and you can say i m selfish   and you can say that i m a coward    and you can say that i couldn t have been helped   and you can say that this mindset was a choice   and that you don t understand   and that you didn t expect this    and that you wish things were different   and that you re hurting    but you ll be okay    and i m not selfish    and i m not a coward    and you re right  maybe i could ve been saved  but i wasn t    someone once told me that i wasn t broken  that i just needed someone to choose me  to love me    and that s more than true    how can i feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn t want to be in my life    everyone that matters sees this light in me  including my parents    that i m special    i am luminous    i am warm   i am beautiful   i am talented    i am smart    i am magnetic   i am powerful    but at the end of the day  they choose to remove themselves  to enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch    only ever touched for your own gain  your own pleasure    just so show that you have me    but my beauty  my accomplishments those are all mine    and i was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day  each week  each month    beautiful they say  precious even    kept safe  appreciated    used when deemed appropriate    treated with care  sure  for the most part     when treated at all    packed away    and it s fine that you guys couldn t be bothered much   i tried to give myself meaning    to feel loved without touch    but when the only touch i can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me    and my voice muted   my pain overlooked  my cracks sanded over  but never filled  what could really be expected   my mother hurt me    she hurt some of you    she hurt herself    and the elephant in the room is that we re all fucked up because of it    im fucked up because of it    i remember    i remember   i remember    i fucking remember    i wish you d let me talk about it   i wish you would ve be angry with me for hurting   i wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home    i wish that i was never told that i was the downfall of our family    because i wasn t    and news flash  my mother wasn t either    what happened to her was    and i wasn t alive yet  i don t know what happened to her    but something did  and you know    so please  on my literal dead body  fucking talk about it    let this be a lesson  not about how you treated me  because that s not what i m getting at  this ain t about me    let this be a lesson about truth  about honesty    talk about your traumas    i made my own decision  i did    talk so each other    please    i tried    i tried to take the broken pieces  the wholesome ones  the dark  and light  the beautiful  the confusing  the questionable  the hurtful  and loving  the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself    i tried to create something with what i had   to play the cards i was dealt    but rayvaun if anyone knows i m awful at card games  did i just joke in my suicide note  yeah i think i did     maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand  or a piece to your puzzle    but the game didn t make sense to me  the pieces just didn t fit    so i folded    i m not sorry for what i did  unfortunately    i think this is what i needed and what you guys needed too  you ll see    god sent me here to teach a lesson    about truth    about pain    about compassion    about how time doesn t stop    or something  i don t know    i don t have much else to say    i hope that when it s dark out  you feel me in the chill of the wind  that when it s sunny  you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin   when the ocean comes and goes  you imagine my curls in the air  free  unapologetic    i wish that kevin could know how much i love him    please take care of him    he s an angel  truly    here s to best chances   at peace   at closure   at warmth  at forgiveness   cause when your new eyes meet mine  you won t see  no lies   just love   like snow   like gold  i will be pure                    ,1

ever wake up every morning and you want to die  my depression as constantly began to get worse and worse  it s been years since my last suicide attempt and i was supposed to try again this year  but then i got a girlfriend  she loves for me cares for me and makes me feel great when we are together  but  even thought we live together i hardly get to see her because she works days and i work graveyard  so when i get home she has to leave  i see here a total of maybe    hours a work week  and all those hours i m away i feel like nothing has changed since before i met her  i go into such deep depressions that i feel like my heart could stop at any moment  wouldn t be opposed to it anyway   i m scared to die  but i m not scared of being dead  the only time i m happy without her is if i smoke and that last a couple hours tops  i don t know why i m so sad  plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort  i have it made  good job  love of my life  a place to lay me head at the end of the night  sadness overwhelms me almost daily  i ve tried everything i can  i wake up ever morning and wish i hadn t  living seems like an endless battle that i can t win   everyone thinks i m joking when i tell them i want to die  but honestly that s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth  anyone else have the same problem  ,1
i think i have decided to do it  i have thought about suicide constantly for many years  my entire life  i have felt as though i have been genuinely cursed  truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and i cant help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be  i cant even talk about my biggest problems  but a combination of mental illness  constant weight issues  being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings   i have tried holding out  i have tried soldiering on and i have done it for many years  but i live in a constant state of fear and suffering  my sister  who is probably the person i love most in the world  is one of the few reasons i have held on  because i felt that taking my life would hurt her  and i still believe that it would  but i have been thinking about how we are getting older  and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults  she deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me  how can she ever have that  honestly  i cant fight this anymore  i have seen therapists and taken antidepressants  but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so i can sleep  i just really cant take it anymore and have stopped thinking about if i should do it and more about how i should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people i love the most  im thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train  i dont know why i am posting this  but i just needed to get this off my chest before i do it  thank you for your time and i genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine  ,1

i m    and honestly just have no will to live anymore it s like    one good thing happens and then a million shitty things happen and i can t seem to get one moment where i am ever truly happy  then i m constantly anxious and paranoid  plus i ve been hallucinating   what s the point  the only reason i ve stayed here past    years old is because of my sister and now she s a little brat who hates me because all i do is stay in bed  my parents don t say it but i know they are disappointed and wish i was a better child   all i have is my girlfriend who i can t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before i get the chance to even kiss her for the first time   i can t open up to anyone close to me because to me it s not opening up it s just dumping all my problems on them   i just wish i didn t fucking exist  that people didn t care about me and that i could die  or start self harming in peace again  i mean i did relapse but i can t even relapse on my wrist so i doesn t hurt as bad i have to cut on my thighs   i just want it to be over  all of it  my depression  my anxiety  my fucking undiagnosed shit  my family problems  i wish that my ex had never molested me  i just want it to be over and i can t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it  i m pathetic  ,1
after    years of life no one knows me well enough to give me a eulogy you ever sit around just picturing your funeral  hell i don t even want a funeral  no one cared enough to get to know me when i was alive and they surely won t care when i m dead  i wish that could actually be arranged  to just get thrown into the ground without a word being said  cause that s how i lived my life  no one wanted me around alive and i don t want them around when i m dying  ,1
i just wish id get cancer or some incurable illness life just isnt worth living  when youve got the unfortunate mix of being unattractive  irratible  and dumb you realize how shitty the world is  i really want to kill myself but i love some people and would feel awful if my suicide effected them  even if it only affects them for a year at most  i just wish id get cancer and die so people could say it was bad luck instead   i dont know  maybe i should start smoking cigarettes or something  i wonder how many ill have to smoke to get the desired results ,1

my name is john i dont know what im looking for here  i just want to be heard  im posting this on my actual account because i want people to know who i am   every day i wake up to a physical pain in my chest  its the kind of pain that cant be rid of through aspirin or ibuprofen or tylenol  its much like hunger  except it cant be satiated  every day i wake up and feel it  but i go to class  i do homework  i smile  i laugh  all because thats what people are supposed to do  im supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world  but i cant  im tired  im sick of it all  im sick of being alone    every day i cry  most of the time its when my roommate is gone  but sometimes i dont have that luxury  i work at my schools library  and the other day i was assigned to sort books  while i was working  i lost it  i had to sit in the bathroom for    minutes and try to collect myself  when i finally left  i stared at the same title for    minutes  all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it   i just dont know what to do  ive never had a girlfriend  and i was a virgin up until    til i finally had enough and paid a prostitute  it was shit  i couldnt perform because i was drunk  and she was obviously just in it for the money  no passion whatsoever  all through high school i watched my friends get in relationships  i listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends  i enjoyed their company  i considered them friends  but every day something inside of me collapsed a little   then  finally  at    i met a girl through tinder  i really really really enjoyed talking to her  we talked for like two weeks before we met up  and it was the first time ive been happy in years  every day i was checking my phone multiple times a minute  some people say that a relationship wont fill the hole inside of you  but after that night i can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life  i want someone to want me and enjoy my company    when we met up  i thought things went well  we hooked up  the sex was good   really fucking good   but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me  but a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldnt talk to each other any more  now  this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys  some of whom were one night stands  and kept in touch with  every  other one of them  this was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza  burgers  and french fries  because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down   but  i  was too awkward to keep in touch with   i  was too much work    and that broke me  whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed  for years  ive tried to socialize  ive tried clubs  ive tried jobs  ive tried talking to people around me in classes  and it hasnt done anything  i thought maybe it was because i wasnt physically attractive  but then i got in shape and it changed nothing  so i gained a little weight back  and then i met her  i had a chance with a girl  i thought she liked talking to me as i liked talking to her  but i was wrong   through her i discovered the truth  im fundamentally flawed  i cant socialize  im not attractive  there is  nothing  physically impressive about me  i have no hobbies  im boring as shit  im awkward  i have no redeeming qualities  at all   i dont know what to do about it either  i tried a number of hobbies  skateboarding  puzzles  reading  television  exercise  drawing  instruments  etc  it all bored the shit out of me  i had  zero  fun    i lie to everyone  i tell people i got laid in high school  i tell them i had a good size friend group  the truth is  ive never had more than a couple friends at a time  and ive never been in a relationship  every day this eats me up  every day i wake up  im disappointed that i didnt fucking die in my sleep  ,1

my friend    f  is going to kill herself in less than a month  this is a call for help   i met her at the start of       where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school  she was a very social person and easily became friends with other people  so she had no problem fitting in  since we had similar classes  she and i got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year   things seemed normal at the start  but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn t sleeping well  she often slept at school  and started skipping classes  at first  nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy  some time passes  and she s getting visibly worse   crying more frequently  eyebags getting darker  less energy etc   one day  i noticed cuts on her arm  around late october   i immediately confronted her about it  and she opened up because we were quite close at that point  but wouldn t really tell me why she was self harming  over the weeks  when we had exams finals  she got much worse   she started cutting much more frequently  on her arms  legs  chest etc  skipping classes one day  she was caught and sent to the vice principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse  mistake   after getting sent to the counsellors office  her mum was called to school to pick her up   on the way home  her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming  she was also referred to a psychiatrist  that she didn t go to  because her parents never bothered to get her to one   not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason  and the price being another  despite spending thousands a year on tutoring    when she was younger  around   or      she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues  he would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her  her parents never cared enough to notice  which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment  even years later  she s still afraid of her brother  and only talks with him when absolutely necessary   after her mother found out about her self harming  she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters  as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming  there was no place to escape to either  as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm  an incident happened just two weeks ago  her father  mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely  when she felt a little hungry  she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room  thinking she had caught her self harming  this was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock   the lock was the barrel bolt type  and the bolt had been removed   she was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home  so she was sure she was safer  her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this  as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn t at home   she has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month  and i think that she is      serious and able to follow through   right now  only one other friend and i know most of the story and her intentions  and we don t know what to do  so far  we have been trying our best through talking to her  getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it   we came to reddit to ask older  more experienced people for advice     what are the things we should be doing  and how  the adults around us are untrustworthy and she won t open up to her therapist   and it s very unlikely that she would ever    what should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe    since we already know that she s going to  most likely  commit suicide  what can we do to help prevent it   sorry this is a bit of a long read  but this is a basic summary of what my friend and i know  as far as we know  there isn t anything else to tell  feel free to ask anything to clarify and i will do my best to answer with what i know     x   b        edit    thank you so much for all the advice and responses  my friend and i have talked it through and  i called the suicide hotline  after explaining the situation  the person told me that the best and most i could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her  if it really comes down to it  we are prepared to call the police   to clarify some things   whether we want to or not  it s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there s three weeks to the end of the holidays  as far as i know  all the adults around me would rather i stay away rather than help which is why i asked for their help  all of our parents are quite strict as well  she d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away  then calling after to tell them where she was  and when she got home  she was yelled at for a long time   i ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday  and continue to make plans with her  keeping in mind all the advice you ve given us  i might post again in the future  hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health  thank you so much for all the support you ve given me  and i hope this turns out well for everyone  ,1
reddit was the best and worst thing i have discovered it all started with studying for the sat  i created a reddit account to join r sat to get extra resources and help    but then i discovered other communities of reddit   until i dawned upon r suicidewatch  i spend hours on this sub  i m so entranced by the resilience of others and what they have overcame thus far  but more selfishly i m addicted to being heard  i m addicted to voicing my sadness  my anger  my guilt etc  i love how ppl response and i love how ppl care  i crave this feeling real life but i know this fantasy will never be realized    however  this has proved catastrophic for me  i spend so much time on this sub and neglect all my other responsibilities  ,1
i did it      trigger warning  suicidal ideation  suicidal gestures  hospitalization  tldr at end  i have been passively suicidal for some time  lately  it had become more active  i was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression  anxiety  and burnout due to the amount of stress i was under    last monday night  i took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation  i obviously failed  but i felt strange    unfulfilled  i didn t sleep that night  i just cried    tuesday i went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while i was training new employees  i just got this sudden  overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night s failure  i also got a snap of lucidity  i blurted out to my office manager  i need to go to the hospital  and left work    when i got to the er  and was standing at the front desk  the triage nurse asked me what brought me in  i looked at her and just said  i am having a mental breakdown  and started sobbing uncontrollably  they immediately brought me back to the safe observation room  had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood  they had me strip and put me in safety clothes  paper patient scrubs  and the er doc came and interviewed me first    the er doc decided i needed a psych evaluation  which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on  at some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues  and i just started laughing  uncontrollably  the nurse looked troubled by this  she asked if that was normal for me and i said yes  especially when i was really stressed and anxious    she started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment  full or partial hospitalization  it was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment i should receive  she told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization  i asked if i had a choice in this matter and she just said  no  as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a    hour hold  we are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through    i just kind of chuckled and said  that s fair    the three days went by slowly  no tech  no outside contact  just treatment groups  i painted a recipe box  drew a picture of a tree  learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself   mealtimes  we got a choice of what we wanted  within reason    and no sharp edges   and meeting with doctors  social workers and your assigned nurse    at the end of my involuntary hold  they asked if i was ready to be discharged from inpatient  and i said yes    hours later i was released to the world  but not fully from the hospital  i was placed in partial hospitalization  weekdays i have to check into the program at       and get out at    they are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such  i have my first full day of php on monday    i always avoided seeking help  when i went to the hospital  i had truly given up  they were nothing but nice to me  and being cared for gave me hope for the future    if you feel suicidal or self harmful  it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital  the cost can seem prohibitive  the social stigma can be repulsive  admitting you need help can seem impossible    i m not paying for my hospitalization or php  the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold  no one knows why you are there  or if you even are there  unless you tell them or give the staff permission  and if you are on this board    you have already admitted you need help    i have learnt a lot the past several days  i entered with an open heart and nothing to loose  and grew because of it  please  consider going to the hospital    tldr  tried suicide for the hundredth time  had mental breakdown  admitted myself to the hospital  got better  ,1

stuck in the house with my rapist  as title says  lockdown has me stuck      in the same house as my brother  who raped me over the course of   years when i was a kid  usually i have work  friends  boyfriend  places to go  things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time  but all i hear when i wake up and when i go to sleep is his laughter  laughter that should have been mine  hes disabled  so everyone ignores what he did  as if it somehow means it doesnt hurt me because  he wasnt  trying  to hurt you   but he did  i look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take  whats the point in continuing on if im just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen  ill never marry  because ill never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings  my depression  my complete lack of emotional control  im already     sure my bf is readying himself to end it  ill never achieve my dreams because i lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself  ill keep pushing people away because im so afraid theyll hurt me  whats the point in living in a world where people want you so little  theyll defend and protect your rapist  all i ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me  who would show me that this was not what i deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice  but all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look  but its there  its always there and it always will be  people always tell us assault victims that were  survivors  but i dont want to  survive   i want to live  but i dont think i ever will  ,1

passive suicidal ideation i have passive suicidal thoughts at least semi regularly  the best way i can describe it is like standing in front of a firing squad waiting and wanting them to pull the trigger but they never do  i dont know if anyone else can relate to that description   edit  wow  i wasnt expecting so many replies  not that i thought i was alone in thinking this way but its comforting to know theres people in similar situations  ill be    next year and ive been living with this and borderline personality disorder since my teenage years  i honestly dont know how im still here especially since ive engaged in a lot compulsive and impulsive behaviour  but i am still here  ,1

i participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal i hoped that participating in this walk would give me hope  and help me see how much suicide impacts the lives of the people left behind  instead  i felt miserable  everyone was writing messages for people theyve lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see  i feel so incredibly screwed up saying this  but as i read the messages  i was envious of the people they wrote about  i was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because i know i dont  this is my first time saying this out loud  because i am so fearful of being judged  but it feels good to get it off my chest  ,1

i havent been okay for a long time  im only alive because i dont know how to die  they say you shouldnt bottle up your feelings  they say honesty is the best policy  theyre right of course  but that doesnt mean what should be done is the same as what can be done   i fucked up  not in a huge way  not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term  im a lazy asshole  am i escaping  am i hiding  and i distracting myself  doesnt matter  i was supposed to be working  i wasnt  i got reprimanded  and im taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today   so here i am  in tears because i take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally  i dont want to die  dieing hurts  dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason  dieing is complicated  i want to have never existed  then no one would hurt   i want to tell people im hurt  but its not their problem  i want to tell people im not okay  but who am i to ruin a perfectly good day  people get so upset when you tell them things that suck  i dont want to make anyone upset  so i go through one day where im in pain  then two days  then a week  a month  two months    i feel like if i just wait and stay quiet  things will get better  like a toothache you ignore until you dont notice it anymore  why bother a friend when i can just wait  eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end   but this pain isnt ending  i dont think the pain ever ended before either  new pain digs up the old pain  but im not about to ruin anyones day  im not about to complain  my problems are mine  who am i to foist my problems in someone else whos job isnt to deal with my shit   thats exactly what it is  shit  what good is shit  what good is a person who has nothing but shit  i want to have never existed  death seems like the next best thing  but i live in a place with no access to it  no tall bridges  no tall buildings  id take pills  but thats not a guarantee  id shoot myself with my husbands gun  but i dont want him to get in trouble  im too squeamish to open my veins  i dont know how to end this  if i did  i would have left earth months ago   just because im here doesnt mean im okay   edit  gold  really  thanks  ,1
im worthless im   m  my dad is a pussy  my mom is abusive and screams at me for  taking his  my dads side  whenever i try to stop her  at school i barely have friends and those that i do dont really like me theyre just trying to be nice   i am so hopelessly ugly that its      guaranteed i will never have a girlfriend  this is not a body image issue  its just a issue of my bad face  and im a guy  im     and not growing anymore too  just to make things worse   ive never done anything at all with my life  just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her  i am never happy anymore at all  just more misery every day   i also have irritable bowel syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby   my parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year   th grade   which means i have zero social skills  i dont even have the building blocks for social skills  ive never been to a party or even gone to anyone elses house  until this year at    i had never even talked to another person under       i wasnt even allowed to play games as a kid  i was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep  my parents were both extreme nerds with     iqs  neither of who wanted me  my mom just had me to spare her   months of endometriosis pain  she admits this is why she had me     i just dont care any more  my   th birthday is friday which means i can spend it alone in my room like any other day  after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday  final exams that will result in punishment if i dont get a   in my family im told im an idiot who needs tutoring if i get an a not an a   bs are grounds for punishment  no  im not asian   i just wish i had someone to be with or something to do  all i do is make people uncomfortable  some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness  not because they actually like me   nothing will change when i get older  ill still be disgusting and will die a virgin  if i get to be    ill just be an i cel    and even if i get a good job or have any academic success  its all pointless  nobody likes me and i enjoy absolutely nothing    i want to die  a lot  but im also afraid that theres no afterlife and its going to be a black void  thats as much a possibility as heaven or hell  i really dont want to be lonely for all eternity  ,1
how do you even respond to a suicide hotline when they ask  how can i help you  i don t know    i don t know how to answer that   there s probably nothing you can personally do to make sure i don t off myself tonight      normally if the person picks up and says how can i help you i just hang back up  tonight i tried to call them three times over the span of a few hours and i just don t even know how to start a conversation   maybe it s a sign from god or some shit that i really should just throw myself off the bridge next time ,1
i understand suicide now  trust me  its not a choice  its an action  i was abused last year  and ive paid dearly for it  pretty much with my life  the same people who didnt understand me when i called for help  blamed it on me  everything has been taken away from me  including my dignity and personality  people help you but they get tired and then they think youre a liar    i just want to say that if youre out there  and youve had suicidal thoughts  i totally understand  i get it now  i believe that those who suicide are too pure for this world  the most beautiful souls dont fit in here  its always the good ones that suffer   im with you  just know that i know  i know that feeling  the world thinks it understands  but it doesnt  im there with you in this moment  in that feeling you have  in the pain  in the misunderstanding  in the absense of justice  i dont have an answer and i dont have any comforting words  but im with you  ,1
i wish there was a reset button for life i really need one ,1
i want to die so badly but i dont have a good method  ,1
dont do it  dont do it  dont do it   please dont do it  im scared i might  please dont do it  im scared i might       please dont do it         im scared i might       please dont do it      i just might   ,1
passive suicidalness does anyone else feel very detached from life  not like in a  i want to die  way but  i wouldnt mind if i got hit by a car or contracted a terminal illness     i think my perspective comes from years of being depressed and actively suicidal  such that death really doesnt scare me or even really matter to me  it feels like living in an ocean  with no shore in sight   sometimes it peaceful  and the ocean is manageable  but sometimes theres a storm and its all i can do to keep my head above water  and no matter how good i get at treading water  inevitably the only way to go is down   im tired of treading water  tired of working so hard just to survive  tired of dreading the next storm  ,1
im in the queue for a suicide chat and theres    people ahead of me its kind of depressing that there are so many of us  ,1
why can t i just be shot already just fucking shoot me already  i cant do this anymore god fucking dammit  why cant the world just give up on me already and kill me ,1
to my boyfriend hes done more for me then he will ever know  i was planning to kill myself after school in early june  i planned it for almost a week  when the day came  i was still low enough to go through with it  i was set on it  however  during last period  he said something  he said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword  dont remember the word   hes suicidal as well  as well as most of my friends  so suicide jokes are common  what stopped me was what he said after  he said he wouldve done it already if it werent for me  this changed my view instantly  and i didnt do it  it made me feel needed  and not completely worthless  the day after that day was actually a bit better  and it stayed a bit better  i havent been that low since  its still hard to deal with  but its more bearable now  if i had actually done it  i would most likely be dead right now  i could never thank him enough  but ill never be able to tell him  i love him so much  ,1
i want to die  i want to just vanish  ,1
tell me im not the only one that do this sometimes i play dead  let me explain myself before you think im nuts   i stop breathing on purpose for as long as i can  and i pretend to be found dead  my body relaxes and i tilt my head to one side  my body is limp and unresponsive to any stimulation  somehow  it calms me down when im having a crisis  because it is a dream that i cant make come true  i cant leave my family  since they would never forgive me  am i the only one that do this  ,1
does anyone else feel like suicide is the way theyre  meant to go   i dont think thats the right way to phrase it but i really dont care about anything right now    the way i feel right now  and have for the longest time  is not something i can deal with forever  i dont know when ill die  this year  next year  whenever  but im almost      sure that itll be by my own hand  it feels like its inevitable  ,1
nobody knows who i am  remember me  please  im sorry this is so long   nobody knows who i am  i havent had a friend in years  i dont remember what friendship was like  when i talk to people  something always feels off  as if im speaking a different language or something  i just want someone to know me  its so lonely and cold and empty and i just want to scream so loud that i hurt myself  i was born in alabama  i was an accident  my dad was and still is a meth addict  my mom is great and has raised me all these years  she left my real dad when his addiction got too bad  i was about   or    maybe younger  we moved to a new town  she met a new guy  my step dad  he was good at first  we moved to texas for his new job  he broke   something in his changed  he became abusive  he didnt hit me  and he only hit my mom once  but he was verbally and emotionally abusive  she was with him from when i was in first grade to fifth grade   he started storing food and water in his room  note  his room  my mom slept in my room with me because she hated him  he thought we were going to poison him   both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time  and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night  even though i was going through this  those were the happiest years of my life  or maybe im just looking back with rose tinted glasses  at school i had so many friends and everyone liked me  everyone though i was funny   in fifth grade my depression and anxiety started  i started to realize i was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about  they started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras   my best friend was a boy named ben  i loved him and i still do  i think about him a lot  his dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was  gay  to be a close friend with a girl  he pushed me away and now hes gone   i got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me  it was for a pep rally  i was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that  they changed it at the last second  had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead  so they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it  i froze and everyone laughed at me  or maybe they didnt  i dont know whats real and whats my anxiety imagining things anymore   i started lying a lot around this time too  not to my parents  by to everyone else  i made up elaborate fake lives  i still do  theyre nothing special  just  different  my mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade  i had to keep visiting him for a while  he had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadnt left  one time i was at his house  my old house  and tried to run away because i was scared of him  he caught me and called the police on me  i dont know why  my neighbors were watching and called my mom  they were good people   the policeman got there and said i was lying  he told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head  then  he forced me to hug my step dad while i screamed and cried in fear  that memory is one of the worst ones i have  he left  and i had to stay at my dads house still   he blackmailed my mom into giving him everything  the money  the car  the house  my dog  just out of spite  i miss her  her name was ginger  shed probably be around    years old right now if she is still alive  i dont know if she is  i miss her even after all this time  we packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to alabama  i lost everything   i started to realize i was different in middle school  i did weird things  i acted weird  i would touch other peoples hair becuase i liked the way it looked  i still acted like a very young child even at     dont know why  i didnt have a single friend in  th grade   in  th grade  i became truly depressed  i did ha e someone though  her name was mary  shes gone now too  in  th grade  i had a bigger group of friends  everyone still thought i was weird though  i still did weird things  dressed weird too  i know theres probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed  she thinks medicine is bad  pills specifically  thats why im not allowed any anti depressants either   when highschool started  my social anxiety was so bad that i started homeschooling  the homeschooling laws are so lax in alabama that i barely did anything except play the sims all day   in   th grade  we became poor  lost the car  lost everything almost  she got a new job in ohio  we moved again  i lost all of my friends again  i homeschooled at first  then started going to the local highschool  i thought everything had changed  that i could be normal  it was hell  everyone hated me  my favorite memory is when i walked into a room to get something  only to hear  does she seriously dress like that  wow    it hurt  we were still pretty poor and i was doing the best i could  all of my clothes were from goodwill  there was one guy there who was nice to me  his name was evan  i hope he has a good life  he was one of the best people ive ever met  luckily im kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early  so for   th grade thats what ive been doing  its so lonely  its so fucking lonely i just want to scream and scream and scream but i cant  ive never know what its like to be in love with someone who loves you  ive never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close  i feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me im not  i posted on amiugly and everyone said i was pretty  i thought it would help but it didnt   ive become very paranoid  im scared all of the time that people are out to get me  that my life is a simulation  that im dead  i talk to myself  either comforting words telling myself its ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt i am  im scared  i told my mom about the depression  and the anxiety  she doesnt know im suicidal  that ive been planning out what best way to end it for months  i cant go to therapy  theres a huge scholarship learning abroad program im signing up for and they wont let me go if im a fucking loon   so im stuck between a rock and a hard place  the only reason i havent ended it is because i want someone to remember me  to mourn me  other than my mom   i have a sister  i only found out about her when i was   ish  shes my half sister in my dads side  i dont know how old she is anymore  i was so happy to meet her  it was so good to have a sibling  i felt like i had a real family  she left for college and immediately stopped talking to me  i havent heard from her in years  the last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago  i miss her  she was good   her and my dad wont even know im dead  my last birthday was sad  i had been planning out my sweet    for years  i didnt have any birthday parties for years because i wanted to have one big one  when it finally came around  i didnt have anybody to invite  it was just me and my mom  i ate some cake  opened my presents  and played video games  not terrible at all  but not what i had been dreaming of since childhood  im supposed to turn    next month  march the   th  please remember me  please if you have the time  read my story  youll be the only people to know it except for me  i hope you remember me  i just want someone to know me again  its so cold being alone   goodbye  mimi    edit   i didnt think people would care this much  the support i have received from all of you is legitimately amazing  so  thank you  i think im going to try and get some help  even if i have to put my studies on hold  im trying to reply to everyone  sorry that its taking so long   see you later  mimi  ,1
i am really close to just giving up everything around me just seems pointless to me  i am currently in the midst of an exam period and have done around   hours of study total for   exams  i have no motivation and just sit in silence just fuckin sad  i am not apart of a friend group and just have friends who each have their own friend group and always see photos of them out with their groups without me while i just sit at home  specifically  there was a time where my mate who i routinely gamed with was going out every friday and saturday night thus taking away the limited time both of us were free to play games in  this meant i would get on by myself and just not enjoy it    i am just sick of not being included and  loved  in a way by my friends and peers and this shit is making me feel so alone and to make things worse i am   m and still havent had my first hook up  which may not sound like a big deal for my age  but always hearing about the new girl or guy one of your friends is with just adds to the loneliness    also  the girl who is literally one of my closest mates is perfect in my eyes and i have been repeatedly sent to the friend zone and have to live with the  pain  knowing how bad i want to be with her and just care for her but she doesnt feel the same     even better is when i only get to see my father twice a year for a total of around two weeks as he lives abroad married to another woman after my mum found him cheating with my now step mum  i wont get to see him until at least      and just am overall struggling   sorry for the long paragraph but i am struggling with a lot of things and seriously contemplating ending it all just could never imagine the pain my single mother would feel  that is the only factor keeping me from ending it all ahhhhhhhhhhhhh  ,1
anyone else ever fantasise about their own death and funeral  i sometimes find myself fantasising about my own death  like picturing how id die  whether its from suicide or even some tragic accident  i imagine what my funeral would be like  all my friends and family being upset and devastated about my death  i wonder who would actually be upset and how much they cared about me  it kinda makes me want to do it even more tbh  it makes me feel something that i cant really explain   i just want to know if anyone else gets this  ,1
i m tired and scared today  after years of psychological abuse  my father finally got physically violent as well   he threw a vase at me and hit me in the head  then pushed my mother to the floor  all while shouting like a madman  he was completely out of control  i saw pure violence in his eyes   after two hours of him screaming and threatening  i told my mother to leave him  she s been suffering for    years   i know perfectly well she s not going to end their marriage   two years ago  for the same reasons  i went through the most terrible times of my life   i d put out cigarettes on my harms  cut myself  was thinking about suicide       i would sit every night on the balcony with my legs hanging from the railings  hoping to find the strength to give myself a little push   today i felt it all coming back to me   i know i couldn t deal with all that again  i want to die  if i killed myself  my mom would get away from him and be free from all the hurt she s been put through  she deserves better  i don t  i m his son  fifty percent of my being stems from him  that alone makes me nauseous  i can t  i just can t  we ll be forced to live in the same house for months  we re in quarantine  i d rather end it now ,1
im gonna probably attempt to kill myself sometime during college for so many years ive been putting it off  because people have been telling me  no dont die  and hobbies keeping me from doing it but looking on how ive reacted to and treated people  my sensitivity towards everything  im going to kill myself    even if i were to continue living whats the point  im so replaceable  i lack self confidence to the point where i feel awful about letting people down when i mention that im sad   im going to do this  plan and all  giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before i do it  at least they have a better look on to why i did it    not gonna lie  kinda scared  but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different  i can literally write anything here about how im going to end it and no one i know will find it  not that they would like what ive written    i dont care that i have potential  i dont care that i have opportunities  i just want to die after putting it off for so long   i hope people care less seeing that im an adult  just to see that im just another cog in the machine   edit  this got a lot of attention wow  thank you guys so much for the support  especially right now when im gonna start college soon  this has really got me to think about where im going with this and im gonna try and get it out of my system  even tho these thoughts might come back  at least i know where to go when they do  ,1
ever feel like youre the most fucked up person in the world and no matter how much effort you put in  you will always be alone and unloved  why is the title so long ,1
i want to go to my therapist just to tell her to fuck off  i started seeing a therapist  this lady i actually liked  she told me the next time i wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself  to go to the emergency room  i did that  she told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me  i stayed there over night about   hours  a therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for   hours  i had to use a prison toilet   in socks  she said i think you re stable enough to go home and you ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist  that s it  yesterday i got a bill in the mail for         for that one night where they did nothing  nothing  i had to reschedule my appointments this month because i just switched jobs and couldn t afford my co pay  i have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me        after insurance  for locking me in a room so i could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor  how pathetic do i feel after begging them for help and they do nothing  a lot of my unnecessary stress is money  why is it so expensive to get help  why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance  why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is  it s so fucking expensive  getting a bill in the mail for   grand when you re suicidal doesn t make you excited to live  i now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health  fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist    i plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me  i m really hurt because i trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse  i hate myself so much and it made me feel even more worthless  i won t cuss at her or disrespect her but this is my life  i went to her for help  i needed someone who could really help and now i can t trust any of them   ,1
     will be the year i make the change i want to see in the world   finally gonna kill myself   all jokes aside i m just not cut out for this  people tell me all these things that are supposed to be comforting about life and it all makes me want to die more  i don t want to try to get better  i just want to die  everything is too fucking hard and i am too fucking weak  ,1
being gay and ugly sucks i m so fucking worthless  no one wants me and i m done trying  i m gonna kill myself  i hate myself for being ugly  my body dysmorphia has gotten worse recently  i can barely eat anything  and i harm myself a shit ton  i think it s about time to kill myself  ,1

do you ever just sit in bed alone  and realize that no one would notice you missing  everyone cares only after they announce your death   ,1
anyone else just living day by day  remembering nothing  thinking about nothing  enjoying very little  and being incredibly lonely  but almost as if its sort of your own fault  like youve done this to yourself  i cannot verbally explain to anyone over a text  or a call  or by any other means how terrible i feel as of this moment  there are too many reasons and too many complicated situations that i would have to explain for anyone to even have the slightest idea of what kind of pain im in at this time    maybe im being overbearing     its almost as if my chest is hurting  i forget everything  i have no drive  im going to grow up to be that old man who tells those kids to  chase their dreams or end up like me     just kill me   ,1
i think my heart might explode or just stop working from excessive self inflicted heartbreak i just    ruin everything  i don t know how to function  it feels like all of the air in my body is rushing towards my heart and pressing on it and it s going to burst at any moment and my chest hurts and i want so badly to just dissolve into earth  why  why can t the world just open and swallow me whole    i m the type of person who invades your life and leaves nothing but destruction  i can t make this work  i think i deserve to feel this pain sometimes  i just wish i could take pain i cause other people away from them and carry that    i hate myself  ,1
bye i ve been diagnosed with persistent depression  i m going to overdose on anti depressants  pain killers  and slit my wrists  a few months ago my parents sent me to the mental health center  but instead of comfort they were frustrated and pissed at me for being depressed  i have anxiety that never goes away  i m spending my last day watching marvel movies and sleeping  i m not going to write a note  probably leave the house around three am and do it by a bridge  i feel at peace thinking about it  the only thing i m worried about is going to hell  i m a christian and i don t want to burn  i want to see god  but i also don t want to be alive  tonight i m going to die  thank you ,1
i dont want to live past    i dont want to suffer the horror of having my body slowly expire  ,1
    ppl online its comforting to know that theres ppl other than me who feel this way but why am i still so lonely in this feeling  idk if that even made sense but tbh i really just  dont want to exist  ,1
im attracted to children  and now ive lost all will to live  ever since i was around    ive been attracted to young children  i have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for    years now  all throughout my teenage years  i lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and i was so disgusted by myself  i was afraid of how others would react so i never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood  all while hoping that this would end when i became an adult  when i reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same  the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and i entered a terrible period of my life when i was so depressed and yet i couldnt bring myself to open up to anyone about why  when i looked to the news and online forums  the word pedophile and child molester essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified  whether they had acted on their desires or not  this stigma scared me a lot  after a year or so living in the dumps  i was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression  i grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments  and being the idiot i am  i thought that it would be alright to tell him since i thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality  i explained my point of view and made it clear that i didnt act on any of my desires  still  he immediately told my brother and i was shunned from my entire family  and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back   i then fell into even greater depression  im ashamed to admit that  in these periods of time  i thought of things such as  if everybody is going to hate me no matter what  i might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens   i still clung onto my humanity  and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online i managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life  i got a job  i made some friends and while im not rich  i could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck  i was still attracted to children and i was still deathly scared and ashamed  but i internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie   i made one particularly good friend from work and i got along well with his family  after knowing him for a few years  i started to think that at least one person i know in real life would understand if i confided to them my darkest secret  it turned out that im yet again a idiot and didnt learn anything  a week ago  we were having a few drinks  and i blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition  i was still wary enough to stress that i had no intentions to  and had never harmed a child in any manner and i thought that that would be okay  the thing is  i had met his nieces before when i was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him  he stopped contacting me  and only called me once out of anger telling me that i had tricked him all this time  that i was a disgusting piece of shit  and that hed kill me if he ever saw me again  hes presumably told my workplace  and im expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon    ive lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out  ive been betrayed by even my family completely over this  nobody understands me at all  the worst thing is  i cant even be angry  it isnt even unreasonable  i pose a tremendous threat to society  i understand that  which is why i fucking hate myself even more for this  at     ive lost all connections to anyone i thought cared for me  and now ive lost my will to live  im going to hang myself tonight if not earlier  nobody will even care  so i wont bother writing a proper note   thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this  it just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time  ,1
my dad killed himself he went missing two months ago and we had no idea where he was for that whole time  and then a week ago someone found his body  hed committed suicide the night he left  hed been dead the whole fucking time  two months  and nobody knew  im not thinking of killing myself  but i dont know what to do  ive been crying for an hour and i feel like im going to throw up  just thinking about how dads not gonna be at my graduation  not gonna see me score my first goal in hockey  not gonna play guitar with me anymore  not gonna do any of that  i dont know what to do  im so lost   ,1
im running out of reasons not to kill myself im not going to kill myself  at least not at this point  but it hurts to live when theres nothing to live for  the only reason i havent killed myself yet  and the only reason im holding back now is because i know it will hurt people around me  but im getting sick of staying alive solely so other people can be happy when i know im not going to be happy    i hate my past  i hate what happened to me  i hate the decisions i made  i hate my body  i hate my personality  i hate the relationships i have  i hate that i have such unattainable dreams  i hate the world i live in  and most of all i hate that either through the laws of the universe or my own weakness i cant change any of this    whats the point when theres literally nothing i can find in my present or realistically see in my future that will make me happy  im not going to kill myself  but i really  really  really want to  ,1
she s gone and so will i soon she left today for the army  she ll be gone a long time for training and then she ll be gone another   years on top of that for her actual job  we had known each other for coming up on to two years and she was the only thing keeping me sane  those late nights when i was on the verge of suicide she would call me and calm me down until i would fall asleep on the phone with her  whenever i was feeling extra down she always knew what to say to make me smile  i would ve been dead a long time ago without her and now that she s gone i know i won t make it more than a week  she was the only thing keeping me here and now that she s gone i know this depression and anxiety are going to get the best of me  i just want to apologize to her for not being strong enough to make it through  ,1
ever wonder how so many people haven t killed themselves  it boggles my mind that there are so many people that exist on earth and just    live  they rlly be out here alive  like if they feel how i feel   how the fuck haven t they killed themselves yet  am i just weak  am i weak for thinking about suicide  all the time  i just can t fathom the idea that people can live life and see a reason to go on every day  i google searched  why don t people kill themselves  and the only hits i got were links related to  why do people kill themselves    but that answer is so fucking obvious to me  i need to know why they dont kill themselves  ,1
a year ago  i promised myself id kill myself on the day i graduated college  it was supposed to be april           graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life  but i dont want anything to do with my future   im not graduating on time anymore  now  i fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression  and i have to withdraw from my classes  but im still thinking about killing myself on april      it would be perfect  ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements  i know i would never amount to anything  regardless of whether or not i make it to my graduation  my depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life  ive fought and fought but always come up short  its not worth fighting anymore   i want to spend the last month of my life doing things i love  or at least the things i used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me  i want to finish my album ive been working on for   years so i have something to leave behind  i want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death  i want to eat good food  play video games  and snuggle with my dog   im glad i made this decision now  its given me a contentedness with living that i havent had for a while  maybe ill actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self hatred and fear of the future   i wasnt meant to live past     ,1

til nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously  even your doctors and therapists  everybody thinks youre just being immature or finding excuses for your failures  the only time they realise that youre really in trouble and need supports and helps is when its all too late   you might think the  professionals  would act totally different  but the truth is that the therapist i met literally told me to grow up and be responsible  and that the doctor i saw more or less implied he couldnt help and wouldnt care as long as its my life not his childs   im trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days  dont want to live through a life im incapable of living through while nobody cares at all  ,1
i made myself cry because of what i did i planned on committing suicide   years ago to the date    years ago next week was the first of    attempts in a   year period  well today i decided to delete all my suicide notes today  all of them to everyone i wrote one to  which even includes my dogs      i have no backups or anything of the sort  it feels so damn liberating y all i can t believe how free i feel now  i cried for   hours  this is the first step in the road to recovery mentally and i love it  i couldn t believe i ever wrote those notes  it s crazy how much better my life has gotten  edit  i just got off of work and i wanted to say thank you to everyone that s been so supportive ,1
it s so sad seeing how many people want to die it s so sad seeing so many people post  well today is the day  and  goodbye  i m doing it tonight  like so many people struggle with this thoughts and its something that happens per minute  if this sub only has    k and so many peoples lives are so problematic that they d rather just disappear from the world makes me wonder how many people attempt or kill  themselves daily worldwide     i don t think the average persons aware of how many people struggle with this issue  most people who have suicidal thoughts keep it a secret it s weird and tragic knowing that person sitting next to you is probably the last time you ll see them again     ps  i m also thankful for this sub like were all in our own little world together where we share our deepest secrets and that there s people who can actually understand what i m going through  feels nice  ,1

i wish there was a stop existing button i was gonna cut down to an artery this easter but my dumbass thought that it would be a good idea to make a bunch of obvious noticeable self harm cuts on my hand and of course my parents found out and they somehow managed to find my suicide note in my geography copy and they never talked to me about it but my mom showed it to my new therapist when i wasnt in the room  dont you ever wish you could just disappear without leaving any pain behind like you were never born because god i sure do    or maybe im just being a dramatic attention seeking teenager i dont even know anymore ,1
i just called the suicide prevention hotline  and they told me to call back when it s less busy because i wasn t  suicidal  or critical enough   talk about a shitty mental health awareness system  i tried to call them because i m very overwhelmed due to covid    and the ongoing civil unrest in the country  i m     and i have never been this anxious before  i am not actively wanting to kill myself but i am having a hard time seeing the  light at the end of the tunnel   you d think the                number would be a better resource  but all they did was shoo me away and tell me my problems weren t critical enough  i feel like i have nobody to talk to  i m so scared and helpless right now  i have no job  i am worried for my safety in the us  i don t feel safe anywhere i go and i m wondering if it might just be better if i take some pills and end it all  i m not planning to do this but i can t see any improvement in the world coming any time soon  i just need help  but apparently the hotline is too busy to help me  ,1
why do both of my parents think everything i do is wrong  i m    years old and these past few years i occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons i don t even know   the reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs  my grades are dropping  getting into fights  or anything that could get me into trouble   it s mostly of simple reason such as   when we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he she is cleaning our room  so my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee  so i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee  then my parents asked what did i say to them  i answered  i just asked them to bring us some coffee   then they told me  why did you say that  you should ve said can you give us coffee since you didn t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room  and now we will have to pay for the coffee   i said it s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn t have it before  they asked me to call the staff again to which i say there s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate just because of coffee        and it s been like this these past few years  i mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn t this to much   since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me  they didn t   just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents   but  this time i feel this would be the last     i couldn t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who s causing the problem  they keep telling me i m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life   i get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don t know  i don t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it  all i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you re reading this  ,1

why suicide is so damn hard  i never understood why people call it  the easy way out  its definitely not easy at all  i keep having suicidal thoughts and plans everyday and i only acted on them once and i never did it again because its too hard and there is a lot of risks  no one wants others to be traumatised because of him and no one wants himself to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life   my suicidal thoughts are worse than ever and i cant deal with it anymore  i just want the pain to stop ,1
haha help yes  i am suicidal  yes  i am  getting help   posted on mobile    i dont believe in an afterlife or religion  i only believe in the void after death  where my conciousness ends  with that in mind  dying doesnt seem so bad to me  in fact its very attractive  especially since i cant imagine myself doing anything productive with my life  or getting a good ending  i think that if i die now  i will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset  i also believe that even if i was happy or successful  none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet  much less the universe  with no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality  i feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that i am unjustified in killing myself  i have had many people make the argument  your family and friends will be sad   my reasoning is this  in the void  my conciousness  and by extension  my conscience ceases to exist  this means i wont have to worry about any moral issues  including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever  ,1
bye guys it was nice knowing you i just had enough so i will commit suicide tonight good luck with the rest of your lives bye ,1

literally dying inside my partner of    years  and wife of   months  came home from a trip to ireland to ask for a divorce  completely out of the blue  turns out she met someone over there that  she fell in love with   that cut her off  yay  and made her realize she needs to  find herself  without me  forever    then the other day  after two beers  i failed a check stop and got a dui  licensed suspended for at least    days   i am literally gutted inside and think about suicide literally every minute of the day    im abusing alcohol and cannabis just to get through the day   how do you even think about the future when youre entire life has been destroyed    i already see a psychologist and psychiatrist for bipolar      edit  im honestly blown away by the number of supportive comments  and zero negative comments  received from this group  to answer a bunch of questions  yes i am trying to quit alcohol  although this weekend wasnt great  im using cannabis for now  i got a prescription for ativan to get rid of the panic attacks  i was going to the gym daily until i lost my transportation  and im struggling to get outside even to walk the dogs  todays my appointment with my lawyer regarding the dui      thank you all again  ,1

i think im gonna die i looked it up and the safest dose is     mg of acetaminophen  i took     mg of it  i know it takes hours for it to work  but it happened  i dont know why i did other than i want the pain to stop  so i guess im just on reddit for the next while  and trust me  i know it will take days  i just hope i can hide the pain ,1
ive been reading this sub for the pass   hours  and think i dont want to kill myself anymore  i might be a waste of space and money to everyone i love  but i feel   i dont want to kill myself about it    i think tomorrow  i will try to work on it  and hopefully become something worth loving again      edited    i really appreciate your kind comments  but today was another awful day   a lot of you asked me  to talk about it  so here is more background   i have to admit  i dont have the courage to kill myself  but i am still hating every minute my life now  my problem is simple  i am sick   not my body   but my mind  i cant fix it  my psychiatrist cant fix it  my psychologist cant fix it  meds cant fix it neither   i dont know what to do  i feel like i am impresioned in my own body  this is slowly killing everything nice i had in my life    i know you will say   its only your mind you can fix it    but i am being in this for    painful years and there is little to no improvement  just pain  day after day  every day   i have to look to ones i love and feel the disappointment  the rage  the sadness of my condition  today  the same happened   the same way it happened day after day for a decade   i dont know what to do  i would give everything to be okey again  there would be no price i would not pay  but i feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death ,1
do you ever want to die because youre just so bored of life  my life isnt really bad  everything in is just pointless and boring  i just do the same shit every day  all while mildly resenting my existence and life  i wont ever be successful or important enough to be able to justify my own existence to myself  ,1
i m here for the first time  and probably the last    i ve turned to many places to try and get rid of my depression and suicidal thoughts  none worked  the only place i can get rid of them is at my summer job  where i m surrounded by people who like me and people who i can talk to  i ve decided nothings working  i don t know what to do  i just cried on my porch for an hour and my sister and her friend made fun of me  i can t do this anymore  i m    yrs old  so i think i d rather end it now rather than in twenty years when i m in a worse place  i know i won t make anything of life  so  i don t think i ll see my next birthday  or any friends  of mine  fifteen years was enough  bye  ,1
anyone else hate waking up waking up and realising im still alive is one of the worst fucking feelings in the world  it just fills me with dread that i have to find a way to exist for the next    hours without hating every second of it ,1
ive come to accept this ive accepted that i will do nothing with my life  die alone and miserable   ive come to accept my death and i embrace it with open arms  each day drawing it closer  is a day where i am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away  it sounds cliché but it really feels like it   ive accepted that life is a flood  washing over me like waves crashing into rock  slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust  it feel like i have no control in life  that i am just a person looking into another miserable persons life  who is getting worse day by day  slowly succumbing to the poison known as living   i know that this sounds very cliché  but this is the best way of describing it  grades are going down  im not loving what i do  i dont feel motivated to do anything anymore  feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife  but no sharpening it  its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse  no love  no happiness  hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point  i try seeking help  i go to a psychologist and i try to get better myself   im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents  been writing a diery of all my thoughts  not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out   but ive reached a serious low point in my life  a point where im looking for other peoples advice  an outside perspective if you would   sorry if there are some mistakes in my english  not my first language after all  ,1
considering killing myself this night life sucks anyway  ill never be able to make it out of boring and mundane modern life   im jsut nobody  ,1
i admitted that i was suicidal to my boss  and his response resulted in cutting myself  i  a    year old female  am a teacher  rejected multiple times  but now teach yet again  worded that pretty stupidly but    anyways   i was reported by some of my co workers that i have been doing my job poorly  in what way  i dont know  maybe the pauses in between sentences  dragging out words  or arriving to the classroom    minutes late  i went to the principals office and asked what exactly is preventing my potential  told him instantly about my depression  due to some advice given to me in this website  he said that im faking it for an excuse to slack  or that im looking for attention  i just abruptly left   it reminded me of how cruel and heartless people can be  and how worthless i am in the grand scheme of things  one thing lead to another and    read title   this abyss keeps getting deeper and deeper  ,1
i want someone to grab my shoulders  look me in the eyes and say  i understand   ,1
i hate suicide hotlines because you use every ounce of energy and will left within you to explain things  only to be given some bullshit advice  like  look out the window and drink tea   srs that happened once   ,1
no hope  no strenght  no future  ive spent   and a half years institutionalised  going in and out of different facilities  been diagnosed with szpd  paranoid schizophrenia  depression and social anxiety  before that ive spent   years untreated  including a year in total social isolation  was told by a psychotherapist that i was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care   ive since got out and found a job ive always dreamed of having  i am trying to improve and integrate into society  but the effort seems fruitless  i feel like i am constantly lying to people by acting as if everythings alright  by smiling and pretending to be happy  even my therapist couldnt tell the state i am actually in  needless to say  even though i told him about it  he didnt help much   i am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants  following any advice given in therapy  its just not helping me against this   ive tried looking for a suicide hotline  but there are no active ones in my country  so ive decided to post here and its the first time i am opening about this to strangers  please  dont tell me to discuss this with my family  the last time ive told them about it   they commited me to yet another mental hospital   i dont believe in any possibility of this situation getting better  my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility  it wont take me much more to step over the edge  into death this time  ,1
the worst feeling is wanting to cry but not being able to  ,1
self hatred every little thing i do wrong makes me hate myself so much more  i ve done so much wrong i honestly feel like i m past the point of no return  i really wish my body could just give up and die on command    my life feels like it is so far beyond repair  i just wish i was never born at this point nothing in life has been worth this  i will never be happy  and i don t know what to do with that information  i want to die but i can t do anything about it   i wish i could just do something  i never do anything to try to fix my problems i just make more  i sometimes try to fix something but when it feels like i m making progress i always take    steps backwards in the wrong direction    i will never get better  i can only move downhill  i could keep typing forever about how much i hate myself but there is no point  i will never do anything about it  i am just a bystander watching as my life wastes away  i guess i should just hope it goes by quickly ,1
no  i wont be turning    in       i already have pills to end it  edit  thanks for the downvotes  thats all i needed to know about how much anyone cares  ,1
 serious  went to my doctor for help about suicide for depression and   anxiety  he called the police despite that i stayed calm all the time     police rushed me and pushed me on the floor  i was so stressed out i couldnt move  and was like a stick  unvoluntary   they said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm  they finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic    cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point  and i was still half naked       it took   min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital    nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back     hospital was just accross the street of the clinic   they brought me to the hospital for   hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before  because at this point  from now own all the rest is my fault  i couldnt keep my calm anymore    i was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name  adresse  weight etc  nothing about why i was brought here  so i freaked out often and they shoot me  after this all went smooth  i like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more   no joke  anyway there was litterally nothing else to do   they tell me they will transfer me to another hospital  probably because the   hrs was close to end  i took the ambulance and once i was there    i dont remember anything at all  nothing  niet  nada   i have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home  but i was   min in cars from home    and i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home    and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation   p s  i dont drink alcohol  smoke daily before night  so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map  im    years old man  never lost counscious ever in all my life before that  and also i have zero violences back ground    with all this story my question is   now where do i go to find help   everything on the internet say to go see your doctor  but now i can barely get out of my house  it was already very hard but now its unbearable    i have constant suicide thought for over   years now but also have full custody of my   years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world   shes in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her   p s    im sorry if its hard to follow or understand  im french from québec and there isnt much french forum to get help  ,1
there is so much pain in the world and i don t know  i just wish there was more that i could do to stop it  i feel so responsible for all of the bad things people have done to me  because they have been through something bad themselves  september is just such a horrible month  there are so many horrible anniversaries  and so many tragedies  i know three people now who died in this month  my friend recently became homeless  i m struggling with my studies  my sister told me about her abuse  it s almost been one year since i tried killing myself and i m still here  crying about everything and never really reaching out  i never do anything right  i just wish i could undo death  or do something to make things better for people  i wish i could die knowing it would impact nobody  i m so alone  nobody really seems to care  i really wish every action didn t have an impact   i don t know  i think this is a cry for help  i feel like i m going to do something stupid and maybe at this point it s not even stupid  i m so sorry that i feel this way  partially because i m sorry that i m not living my teenage years happy  but mostly because i know i m probably gonna end up killing myself even when i know it s gonna hurt people  ,1
i no longer want to die  the past few months have been difficult but i think i ve finally come out of this depression  the day i was going to end it all  my boyfriend come over and took me for a long walk  i finally realized i have something to fight for  i know there will still be hard times in the future but right now i m living in the present  thank you to everyone in this subreddit for helping me  keep fighting  edit  wow  i didnt expect this to get so much attention  im glad to help     ,1
why are people saying that anyone under    cant be depressed  ive seen people say that  and that once youre    shit only gets worse  so anyone under    shouldnt complain  are we really just that annoying  ,1
i started researching how to kill myself i havent done that in a looong ass time  thats how i know im back at rock bottom   its the only thing i can focus on  probably cause its the only thing i care about now  everything else is just fucking brain fog  ,1
am i the only one who finds thinking of suicide comforting  the fact that i can always kill myself is really comforting to me  it gives me a feeling of control of my life  that in the end i can decide my fate  and no one can do anything about it   its weird  some days this is the only thing that keeps me going  ,1
no one wants to deal with sad people  but get angry when they decide to do something about it  i ve reached out to people before and they just get hurt  they can t handle it because it s too much or too sad or they don t have the time  it s honestly fine  i understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time  but i know these will be the same people who will be upset if i m gone  my sadness is so inconvenient that they d rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it  there is no fix for my problems and i feel like it s selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful i feel  they don t have to help me  but they shouldn t get mad when i try to help myself   more context  i ve also done therapy for   years and been on multiple meds for depression  anxiety  and bipolar disorder  i exercise  practice self care  and try to do my hobbies when i can pull myself out of bed  i have tried everything else to fix myself  i worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point  ,1
i rather kill myself then working my entire life for greedy ceos and corrupt politicians you need money to live  you need to work for money  well   i dont want to work the rest of my life  even with the occasional vacation because id still have to return to the job  similar to how no matter how happy better i temporarily feel rarely  but return to depression once my mind takes over  i cant do this for the rest of my life  nor do i want to   so im thinking about it    so please god why won t you just take my life and end the suffering here and now      ,1
if i kill myself my mom will be absolutely devastated  thats really the only thing keeping me here  i woke up depressed  as usual  and found a package with my name on it  my mom had got me a pair of earrings for valentines day along with a card telling me how much i mean to her  instead of making me happy  it made me really sad  i dont deserve this   ,1
only reason i havent killed myself is the fear of failing and being forced to live as a vegetable  ,1
isn t it kinda bullshit that you can t confide in anyone that you want to kill yourself without being committed  if you re in such a bad place that you re thinking of killing yourself but not at the point to where you re in immediate danger of doing it  shouldn t you be able to admit this  without being held against your will at a psychiatric facility that your insurance probably won t cover  work won t be happy about your absence at  where you ll be given meds against your will and not allowed to leave   what if i could admit this to a psychiatrist therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med   therapy combo to get me on the right track   because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as i m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for   or more days  wouldn t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future    what if i could just be candid about how i feel so that i can get treated  can t imagine that i m the only one who feels this way  makes me feel horribly alone  how can i best be treated if i m withholding this from my healthcare providers  when i m not in immediate danger  surely i m not the only one who struggles  with this concept  ,1
when ever something bad happens my head always goes to kill your self  ,1
threw all of my bullets in the river this morning  im not gonna lose  this isnt gonna beat me  last time i felt like this  i threw my firing pin into my back yard  once i felt better  i found it  cleaned it  and put it back    but at this point  i dont think i can ever have a gun again  got rid of the bullets first  since without them  its useless  i think im just gonna drop it off at the police station and tell them i dont want it anymore      its just so hard to fight  i dont want to be alive  i want to die    things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person    i found out my ex  who i still cared about deeply  was beaten to death  she died cold and lonely  with nothing  in the street in front a a fucking salvation army soup kitchen  she stole clothes to stay warm  and some asshole decided she needed to die for that    i found out that i have cancer  even best case scenario  i am in for a ton of pain and misery  and thats if i even make it  i really hope i dont    and then  to top it all off    i got the girl of my dreams pregnant    the baby is gone    and she wont talk to me  at all    im not even sure what happened  did she abort it  did she miscarry  was she trying to keep it  i cant get over the fact that i may never know the answers to these  and so many more questions    like  we knew she might be pregnant  and she seemed to not hate me  but then  all in one message  she tells me that she was pregnant for sure  and now she isnt  and she doesnt want to talk to me anymore    how can you just give someone news like that and then disappear    i kinda wish i still had those bullets  and thats why i needed to throw them out    even if no one ever sees this  it felt good to get it out  i have a therapy appointment in   days  and im just trying to hold out until then   ,1
i will not kill myself before i havent tried everything i have made this decisions when i thought about suicide a lot last winter  i was ashamed of myself because i think that i gave up way to early  i am fighting against mental and physical health problems and i will not give up until i tried everything to improve my situation  i hope you guys do this to its really good to look at things that way  edit  thanks for the silver u drhitshot i hope you are doing well  ,1
it s really sad how lonely being suicidal is like  you can t talk to anyone    and if you can  it s like maybe one or two people  half of them are probably your medical team  who check in with you once or twice a week  and are paid to care about you    you know all your  family and friends care  but it s impossible to talk to them  you don t want them to overreact  you don t want them to worry    you can t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say  no one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living  you don t want to bring the mood down all the time    and the one person you trust to talk to can t handle all of your stress  you can t rely on just that person  it takes a toll on them and stresses them out too  so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can t tell them everything    and then you re just stuck with your thoughts in your head  wondering what s the best thing to do     and then there s the planning    what to write in your note saying goodbye  what to do with your dog  how to leave your apartment  what date to set    i just wish euthanasia was legal so i could die with my friends and family by my side  i wish i could talk freely about my thoughts and plans  and have support in my decision  i wish someone could be by my side in my last moments    but no  i have to do this alone  and it s so lonely    i m not afraid of dying  i m slowly learning to not be afraid if i fail trying to die  and die suffering slowly and painfully  i just wish i wasn t lonely through it all  i wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before i go    ,1
a few months ago i set a deadline  that deadline  march    has arrived  when i last  posted  https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments  mmg z i set a deadline    life seemed completely miserable with no possibility of it getting any better  i continued living day to day  mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside  i continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck  then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up  then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend  then came a tiny puppy into my life  things arent completely terrible at the moment  to quote hyperbole and a half   maybe everything isnt hopeless bullshit   for the moment  i want to live  ,1
should i get a pet so i have something to look forward to coming home to i don t like living with my housemates and i m really depressed  i feel like a want something i can love that isn t a human i need to put so much effort into    maybe like a fish or some shit just so i can have some sort of company  ,1
my only motivation to live is my dog  these days i feel like i am tired of everything   work  friends  family  life itself  im only hanging on for my dog    y o   because ive learned that dogs dont understand the concept of death  im not depressed  im just tired of everything  unless theyre the same   there are days when i feel like i can really pass away already  but there are still days when i want to live  i just dont know how to or why else should i continue anymore    i can only hope my dog would live a healthy happy long life  and i want to make sure im by his side  ,1
psa from the suicidewatch mod team  were getting a lot of complaints about generic  uplifting  or  i love you  type posts and comments  please read and follow guideline  c in the sidebar  we realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help  and  if they havent read the guidelines  it probably hasnt occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do  but a  its likely to backfire and b  theres no excuse for not reading the rules   responding to a suicidal person with messages like this  excerpted from a recent responder who well keep anonymous because they probably meant well       you are not a failure  you are smart  you are young  you have an entire life to live  it is not impossible to become that person you want to be  you can be great   is incredibly invalidating  if the person youre talking to were capable of believing that  they probably wouldnt be at serious risk for suicide   and inflicting anything on them along the lines of  you can do anything you want  or  life is worth living   just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure  because they cant do what you told them to do  believe what you told them to believe  or feel what you told them to feel   as feeling like a failure and or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide  it is not hyperbole to say that    these so called  empowering  messages kill people        guideline  c links to  a previous psa post  http   redd it  cep h  that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of  cheering up  is absolutely against the rules here   if you have any questions  please  shoot us a modmail  http   www reddit com message compose to    suicidewatch      app users  remember you can get to our sidebar here   http   www reddit com r suicidewatch about sidebar  our concerns aside  we are incredibly grateful to everyone who steps up and helps support our vulnerable ops   theres lots of stuff in the sidebar  especially  the talking tips  http   redd it igh    that weve put together to help you be more effective  and avoid dangerous intervention strategies     edit     one other very dangerous type of message is  it gets better    because of the prominence of the trevor project and other similar initiatives  a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that  it gets better  is not just an okay thing  but the  best  thing  to say to any suicidal person   nothing could be more wrong    it gets better  comes out of an initiative to reach lgbt youth who are being bullied and harassed in school   and the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours  which  do  get better  on their own  with time  as peoples peer groups get older   its a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where theyre at risk for suicide   but as a  hopeful  message for someone at risk  its worse than useless   first  it makes promises on behalf of the universe   and the universe may not keep them   second  it offers no understanding  but devalues or even trivializes their agony    ,1

i don t even know how to say this but i feel like this is a good place to get all of it off of my chest  if i even can or honestly even finish this post  i know i m suicidal but i don t know if i will do it basically  the depression began in      when my dad killed himself   no one in my family saw it coming  he never showed any indication that he was suicidal  except for his drinking  which he did when everyone was asleep and he never  to my knowledge  did anything bad while he was drunk  i remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom  looking back  he drank because of his demons but no one noticed   for two weeks after my father ended his life  my siblings and i thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries  i believed her because in a way  she wasn t lying but i ll get to that  my mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us  we were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions   now later on  we found out about what happened  i think there s still stuff about his or my mom s life i don t know  stuff about that day  but here it is   the day before  i remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey  i think i said bye but i don t really know  that was the last time i ever saw my dad alive   the next day  i m waking up for school and i find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while  talking to police  my dad was missing and there had been a car crash   at school  i confided in one of my teachers about the situation and i was worried at all times   i get home and play video games with my brother  my dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital  a little later  my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us  a cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital  we arrive  discover the death of my father and my grandma s son  and i m freaking out   for a bit  i thought i had heard that he was just in really bad shape  about    or something minutes after  finding out he s in bad shape  i discover that instead  he is dead  i went blank with crying  i was horrified  i was whispering to myself  no  constantly and i was rocking back and forth   rocking back and forth when i m nervous  scared  tired  sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day   i ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying  along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so i was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye   i go home after a while along with my family  my brother was at the hospital and my sister was not  at this point  she had no clue that her dad had died  she was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back  she was   hours away  that s a long trip    she was freaking out because a friend of hers  who heard what happened  sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead  she was picked up and was so freaked out and worried   i fell asleep and at  am when i woke up  i go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out   my sister  who i barely see show emotion or cry  someone who s older and i looked up to  and she was destroyed by this  i went up to her and hugged her   my siblings are never affectionate  we hate each other or at least that s what we tell each other  my brother and i s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying  you re a bitch    so hugging my sister  something i don t remember ever doing before that or much after  was a big deal   this ripped my family apart   here s how that day went for my father   he was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car  he got out and left the scene  he walked through the fields so goddamn close to my house  and eventually went and bought paper  a pen  a knife  probably some other shit and went to a hotel  he checked in and i don t know how long he was in that room but what i do know  is he wrote out his letters  there were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped  the police found out about the crash and where he was by now  they were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists   i have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain  but the truth is  he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash  to make it seem like an accident  and he failed  but he couldn t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened  my dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough  he never tried getting help and he left his family   i hate my dad for what he did  but of course i also miss him  this whole post has already taken so long to write because i had to take breaks so i can have mental breakdowns   i was originally going to explain why i m depressed but after writing all of this out  instead i m going to say you know what  i m not even going to continue  i am suicidal but i won t do it any time soon so i can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but i m going to use this post to say that     do not kill yourself please don t  don t do it  my dad killed himself and it destroyed my family   i didn t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe i m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done  but people already knew about that   my life sucks because of my dad  he s the reason i want to kill myself and he didn t even try to get help   i hate him  i love him but god do i hate him   my mom has her own hand in my depression which if i ever do another post  i ll get to  but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last   years   please dont kill yourself  seek help  you matter ,1
i hate it when i see attractive people online tell everyone that they need to learn how to love themselves   title pretty much explains it  it makes me feel worse about myself and it makes me want to end it even more  i feel like if they were in my body then they wouldnt be saying shit like that  ,1

this is just absurd like wtf who the fuck made this world  who the fuck made such a sad ass system   im tired of living this way  where everyone look at you as a robot as a  you only here to do homework  we only spend money on your ass to go to school and later you need to find a job   is this really it  life   money  what are we  arent we humans   why cant we treat eachother with value and respect despite our wealth  looks   why cant we love eachother and help eachother  i feel numb  i feel frustrated that this is what we human really are  a greedy little fucks who only care about themselves maybe not all of us   but the majority of us are just like that   im so tired of going to school to just  get shit done to get to work to get money to survive   and i say survive  not live happily because there is nothing happy about our misrable world    maybe there is things you can enjoy or should i say now its just to  destract myself from my constant suicidal thoughts and my depression   everyone look down on you because  you are a disapointment and you got no wealth   everyone can rise you up and respect you because  this man is a successor  this man got that company   this man is blah  that woman got the money   and honstly    i undersrand how delucional everyone is but    i think we took it way too far  we are losing ourselves in our shit show and im tired   i cant live anymore in a fucked up world that is as a fucked up person that is me     i want this nightmare to be over    im tired of how we humans are associated with our school  work like we are slaves to our survival if you want to survive in a crule fucked up world go ahead      but im so tired of always being a slave to my needs   i dont want to burden  bother anyone with my survival  honstly i dont care about furture success work relationships and life ingeneral  i just dont give a fuck anymore   its all meaningless to me its all gray and pointless to me like why am i even trying to do that or that  to just breath  to survive  to not end up homeless  fuck this shit and fuck survival and fuck money fuck people fuck fake friends fuck relationships who they love only your looks money fuck family who treat you like a fuckin dog slave fuck everything and lastly fuck me and mylife soon i will die     to free myself from my constant stress and my constant highly depressed ass  im tired of living    everything always gets the best of me  edit   also i forgot to mention    why didnt god just make us less greedy  make us less  you have to eat  sleep work to survive  why didnt he just made us pure souls wandering around  enjoying nature  without the need of food or anything  so we all could love eachother and finally no more rape  war   murder its all frustrating why did god made us with so many flaws  why cant god just free us from our suffering   the answer is simple     it might be for  reasons  we humans dont understand well why couldnt he just make us understand why he made us   or it might be just for his entertaintment just like us humans when you are bored    you go watch a movie or something maybe we are only toys and a show to him   there is no exuse nor  reason  is justified to him for making us suffer like this  is there really a good reason for him to make us suffer like this   especially depressed sucidal people   like you realize you dont live that badly you start to feel super guilty about anything to the point only death will free you from your constant guilt  i didnt ask to be a suicidal asshole i didnt ask to have a very close minded family i didnt ask to have such a fat body from the start i didnt ask to be addicted on unhealthy ways to cope with my depression    yet there are religions who tell that when you kill yourself you go to hell really      like    oh wow now im really being forced to get tortured  lol sorry if i sounded rude  im just frustrated    ,1
i just feel trapped sorry if this feels all over the place  im just adding as i remember  also looked back and see its a wall of text  apologies   i grew up in a somewhat dysfunction asian family     i grew up being bullied for my eyes as i have a lazy eyelid  leading to one eye being  larger  than the other  i would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms  eventually after moving to a different school   i went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below  i made some friends and it was enjoyable  my met my best mate ryan who would about    years later  would kill himself  my group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when ryan would start to drift away  he had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time  i still course myself for not reaching out as i thought he was doing ok  i started attending university this is when i learned he killed himself     my father was an alcoholic and being asian  beatings werent uncommon as punishment  there was a time when my mother  sister and i stayed at a relatives place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over  injured his head  and wasnt in the sanest of conditions     my brother died when i was in grade   from some medical illness which i still have no idea what it was as i was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and i dont want to bring any of that back  some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily  just writing practice i suppose  there was a day where i wrote about how my brother recently passed and how i would be attending his funeral very soon  my teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc  this soon made it to my sister who was about   grades above me but still in the same school building  her teacher asked her about the funeral and i dont know what she said in response  later at home  she told my parents about how i told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher s  knew  they berated me  telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others  perhaps this is where i started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as i would just get shit on for sharing     my mother and father divorced while i was pretty young and while my father doesnt mention my mother when i see him  if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document  she would blame either me or my sister for  letting him into the house   she would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced  there are memories of when i was young  i would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and i would come downstairs to see her  she would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother     my mother soon started dating again and i remember that she was dating   guys at once i think  some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work  she asked me which one i liked better and not to tell the guy a about the existence of guy b  i didnt know what was really going on as i was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years i realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once     my sister is doing great  she has a good job and married last year  has good friends  great husband and such  im genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper     my parents work in a factory and immigrated over from china so this was huge  im similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success  my father gave me money for university fees but i spent about     on dumb crap like amazon items or games as i was about    at the time  and its not like i grew up learning how to manage my finances  i was and still am young and stupid  i started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money  i told my parents who i was living with that i needed a break  if i had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which i am but      i wouldnt have been able to take it  they accepted my lie and so i found a job and worked    eventually i went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isnt possible with the course work im still missing but with the lies ive told them  it makes sense why they would think i would graduate  my situation is entirely my fault and i dont know what to fucking do    to top it all off  i play far too many video games as its my escape  recently  my grandma died on my fathers side  and when my sister called to tell me  i was still playing video games as an escape  she could hear me playing and told me to  get your shit together  grandma just died and you dont give a shit   i do  i just cant express emotion anymore  not to my family after all thats happened  she told my mother and she similarly thinks im a human bag of garbage at this point  and i honestly dont blame them  my sister told me once that i am the source of problems in the family and shes not wrong  i agree with her  and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it   some of my cousins are similarly in university and theyre doing great  a bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and im happy for them  i just see how im stuck in my position because of my own actions and i feel absolutely miserable    theres more i can write out but its already a large wall of text   my university has counselling services i can use but its fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and theres a waitlist            i cant even get a job relevant to my degree during university as i dont have co op  all job listings ive seen for internships list having a gpa of     minimum and i hovering around a     average which is about a gpa of       i cant get a job without experience and i cant get experience without a job  and my decreasing gpa certainly doesnt help as i cant even stick my foot in the door   i just dont want to be alive anymore  i just want it all to stop  if i kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit  but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if im not around  ,1
i am a deeply stupid person and i feel completely hopeless for most of my life ive just been blissfully unaware  classic stupid person attitude that i was special and unique  with no evidence to back it up  recently  my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting  and i can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot  just all around dumb  it makes me want to kill myself when i consider that this is fundamentally who i am at my core  here are some examples of how i know i am a deeply stupid person      i smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college  i never gave a shit about my major  but just sort of blindly accepted that i was going to college now  i graduated  after having spent most of my energy partying  with a degree that left me         in debt  i got a job in my major  but was laid off after three years  during my time at my job  i dont feel like i advanced at all  because i was incurious  lazy  and overall unengaged  i showed up half an hour late almost every day  i was a graphic designer  but didnt save any work for a portfolio  so i have nothing to show for it  ive been unemployed for almost a year  i can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school  when i didnt have a care in the world  this is also a reflection of my non existent critical thinking skills  if i had any foresight or insight into problem solving  i would have planned something for myself throughout the years  instead  i coasted through life as if i had no future  with no plan  no thought  and no fucking brains     i can never remember anything  i cant remember names or events  in movies or in real life  because of this i dont really have any opinions  i forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens  a friend of mine recently watched the fellowship of the ring  he was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie  but it was all lost on me  ive seen the movie at least a half dozen times  and i would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch  but i literally couldnt remember anything from it  its like this with everything  i have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests  but i am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way  im a bore in conversation because i have nothing to say  because ive never really learned anything  this causes me to have very low self esteem  im too stupid to remember anything  learn anything  or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting     i am fundamentally lazy  for as long as i can remember  i always have taken the easy way out  i chose my college because i knew i would get in  and then i tried as little as possible  i spend most of my days on my phone  endlessly scrolling through twitter and instagram  i dont take the time to develop hobbies or interests  because id rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom  i lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence  curiosity  i tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me  im so fucking dull i put myself to sleep  i cant keep things clear in my head  its always a jumbled mess  theres no order to anything i do  i always have an empty fucking look on my face that says  vacant   even if i tried to learn something  id just forget it anyway  im going to lose all my friends because im so self conscious about my idiocy that i get jealous of them for the smallest things  such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies     i cant keep up in conversation or follow directions  usually i just sit there quietly  i live with three very intelligent and creative people  and when were all in the same room together  im overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as i listen to their conversations  which are clever  insightful  funny  and informed  i sit there quietly and feel like an idiot  i literally dont say anything  i have nothing to say  its like this with everyone  i cant keep up  im slow and stupid  my friends are going to get bored of me  who would want that around  nobody will ever hire me because im stupid and empty     i lack emotional intelligence  i dont know how to make people feel better when they feel sad  i dont know how to tell people what they need to hear when theyre feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball  im an emotional black hole who takes far more than i could ever hope to give  theres something fundamentally lacking in the way i treat people  when a friends family member died recently  i didnt know what to say to comfort them  i said  im so sorry  im sending you love   its not enough  theres something missing  im so wrapped up in my own problems that i can hardly see outside of myself  i find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery  i wish i could help people  i wish i could help my friends feel better when theyre upset  i never know what to say or how to say it  i come off as robotic and strange  im going to lose all my friends because i dont know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it   these are just a few small examples  my idiocy extends into every area of my life  it covers my entire reality  not a moment goes by that isnt informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one  i have official diagnoses of depression and adhd  over the past couple of months  ive diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder  borderline personality disorder  and autism spectrum  but ive finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability  im simply slow and stupid  my intelligence is low  it makes me feel suicidal to know that i will never be able to have an insightful conversation  ill never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist  ill never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child  my brain function is low  there arent too many connections being made up there  i dont know what the point of going on is  i know i write kind of snappy  and it may deceive you into thinking that im smarter than i think i am  but please trust me that everything ive said is true  i just simply cant keep up with anything  i cant keep anything straight  i cant communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship  i dont know what the fuck im going to do  i hate the person that i am and the person that ive always been  im so fucking stupid  im so ashamed  ,1
the worst is feeling like you have no one to fucking turn to  fuck man   ,1
 but you are just     you still have your whole life ahead of you   lol  you serious  its not that im just   yo  its that im already   yo and there is pretty much no chances of fixing my fucking life anymore  cant you fucking understand that    i have no fucking skills  no friends  never had   never had a relationship  got fired from the jobs i had  have a garbage ass curriculum  anxiety  depresson  childhood traumas  tinnitus  getting fat  have no savings  no will  no motivation or purpose in this fucking life  i find it funny with this fucking bullshit of  only   yo   im fucked  there is literally zero chance of me being able to fix my life and being able to function like a normal or semi normal human being  fuck this garbage ass existence  fuck this planet  this country  my parents  fuck this bad joke called life  ,1
im going to enlist ive been suicidal for a while now but i never had the courage to go through with it   so im going to enlist in the military instead    atleast i wont die in vain with everyone thinking that im a loser ,1
im never calling a hotline again yesterday was the second time they called the cops on me  i begged them not to  i refused to give away my location  they still found me  shoved me in their van and took me to the hospital  at the hospital i waited   hours for someone to talk to me before they got a mental health professional then  who i had to regurgitate my entire life story to before being promptly dismissed  i would have rather just died than go through all of that   ,1
just survived an attempt  dealing with aftermath  i tried to overdose on xanax and alcohol sunday night  it wasn t planned  i initially took a bar to ease some anxiety and i ended up going a few too deep  it was an impulsive decision based on recent heavy losses and overall trauma  apparently i posted on my social media that it was my last post and my reasons including losing my boyfriend  best friend  and rejection from an interest and someone called  i don t remember writing the post  the cops and emts showing up  the ambulance ride  or anything  i woke up very confused  i had dozens of supportive messages online but i can t help but feel very stupid and ashamed  did i just label myself a crazy suicide girl  will people forget  just looking for support right now  i want to crawl under a rock  i m in weekly therapy and see a psychiatrist but i don t know if it s enough  ,1
this sub really helped me  just wanted to say thank you  im using a new account  but previously with my old account i posted here quite a lot  one of my friends discovered my old reddit account and all the posts i made here  and we had a pretty lengthy conversation about it   this sub has some of the most genuinely helpful people  and i really wanted to say thank you to everyone who reached out and helped me on my old account      x   b   stay safe everyone  ,1
i reach out for once and get fucking denied i want to kill myself  but in a last ditch i tried the suicide hotline online chat  i was actively participating when the person said they were closing the chat for inactivity  i responded probably less than thirty seconds beforehand  i have to talk to someone online because no one in person believes me  but even that didnt fucking work ,1
i got arrested buying drugs off the darknet that i intended to kill myself with via overdose and now i am facing a felony and     years in prison  whats the point in continuing on  i have been depressed for a third of my life  the last    years    i have attempted suicide by overdose  opiates  benzos and alcohol    times in the last   years   the first time i woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened   the second time my parents found me and emt s were able to narcan and resuscitate me   the third time i overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to   days later   i dont know if i was unconscious for those   days or what but i was incredibly week  dehydrated and disoriented   that was almost a year and a half ago   every time i survive i try to give life another shot and every year i find myself worse and worse off   i know i am incredibly lucky but i wish i succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide   i feel like i am in the movie office space  everyday feels like the worst day of my life   i dont want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time   my life had continued to deteriorate and i had gotten to a point where i could barely take care of myself   i stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged   i lived in my apartment  only going out to get groceries  go hiking and snowboarding   i asked my parents to take care of my dog because i loved him too much and he deserved better care than what i could offer at the time    its not that my life is necessarily terrible  well at this point it pretty much is  i had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard   its that i have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like i dont deserve what i have been given   i am terrified of failing so i take very few chances and unfortunately even when i feel confident enough to take a chance i end up failing which brings me down further   i feel like my life peaked after high school  not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement  i graduated with full ib  honers and a        unfortunately when i first went to college i had a series of events failures that destroyed my self confidence   anyways back to earlier this year   this was going to be my  rd attempt at finishing my degree and i had failed again   i have been lonely and single for   years  my last girlfriend cheated on me  and this christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so i spent my very first christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state   things were going downhill and again i was getting more and more depressed   i started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure i had food to eat   at this point had lost my job  my friends were sick of hanging out with me because i was too negative   i felt like i was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life   i made the decision to order drugs off the darknet  as i had done a few times before and do it right this time   my package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery   i was arrested and sat in jail for   months   im always surprised when i think that life cant get any more unbearable and jail was just that   after that i was forced into drug treatment for   months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision   my court date is a month away and i am facing a felony and up to   years in prison   i have tried everything to get better i have a therapist and a psychiatrist   i have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin  which doesnt do shit   i have tried dbt and tms   i dont understand why i should keep going   i have completely fucked my life up   even in the best scenario i will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation   ill be barred from a ton of jobs that i was interested in   i cant even get a job at     right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check   i probably will struggle to get housing in the future   i cant even imagine having to go to prison much less for   fucking years   i just feel like this is torture  every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day   my friends and family have abandoned me   i was evicted when i was in jail and lost most of my stuff  im broke   it just doesnt make sense to keep trying   i feel like i have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another   i am so fucking lonely but as much as i would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures   what is the point   even if my life werent a complete shit show i would still feel this way   i just feel like i am pointlessly torturing myself at this point   this whole year has been like a nightmare that i cant wake up from   sometimes i wonder if i actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment   i forgot what it means like to be happy  to be close to someone  for someone to actually be proud of me   i feel like i am just a disappointment and i might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date   i have already pretty much decided that if i get prison time then i will do it but i fear i wouldnt get the chance if that happened   i felt so helpless in jail  they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation i feared the most in life   losing my freedom  my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself   why should i continue to wait around for that to happen   i  ,1
i wish that nobody loved me  then i wouldnt have to feel guilty for wanting to die  ,1
there s no point in living through      i can t do it  everything is too uncertain  i m too fragile  life won t ever go back to normal and i just can t live like this for much longer  we re fucking doomed  i honestly think i need to die before the covid situation here gets worse  i can t do it  i can t live like this for another year  i can t handle hearing about this for another year  i can t do it    i give up  i really give up  i won t last  this is too much  it s hopeless  ,1
i promised him  i ll be there for him  till his last breath now this last breath was exhaled and i lost complete interest in trying to be alive  a part of me  a friend of mine  a family member  just stopped existing at a fracture of a second and i had to give permission to stop trying   everyone is shit around me  i see no value in anyone around me  complete trash  among all this  i had this sacred little life  which gave comfort and was there  just lying near me  with his head on my lap  this little happiness of  mine is gone    i miss you so much and i promise ill do my best to keep going   i m sorry i didn t hear your call for help  at least not early enough    i wish you a meowtiful journey  my friend you are kept for ever in my heart ,1
i find myself crying more in public spontaneously its happened before when i was starting to work years ago but at least i could hold it a bit until finding a place to hide and cry  but now it could happen anywhere  i can barely hold myself together enough to not tear when family visits  or in the line on the market  or in a restaurant  yesterday i just started fully crying on the street and obviously people stared at me    its humiliating  and i cant control it   ill have to learn to calm myself though  please dont give suggestions  possitive thinking has never worked for me  it actually makes me feel worse  ,1
boyfriends classmate jumped off a   story parking garage yesterday he wrote a note and everything  nobody knew a thing  he was so successful  athletic  smart  social  he was friends with everyone  all my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is  how low everyone is  how it just hit everyone  this person took their own life  theyre gone   all i can think about is myself  how many times ive attempted it and failed  how much of an asshole i am for wanting to put that suffering onto others  and yet how much i want my death to impact people  i feel like im not suffering bad enough if i dont kill myself  at the same time  im convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times ive survived   this other kid was so strong  so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap   stories up to his death  he wrote an elaborate note  he kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing  on the other end is me  ive done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself  and i feel like my only personality trait is my trauma  everyone knows im depressed  because i cant help but overshare  i feel like i burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings  and i cant do it   im so ashamed of myself  ,1
wanna die but dont have the balls to kill myself im afraid it will be a painfull and long death its the only thing holding me back but im just tryna find a way faster then a blink so it wont be bleeding out on the floor of my room while everybody is screaming  i just dont wanna have a painfull and long death ,1
my dog just passed away i started considering to end it all a little while ago  when im drunk i have the strongest wish to do it  then  i remember my parents  even if they love me for the sake of social norm  i have those two with me  i couldn t bare to make them suffer like that  especially my dad  who loves his family the most  currently  me      my mom      my dad     we had a dog  she was so loved and well treated  she was so smart  dad and i loved her like it was my little sister  my dad relied so much on her emotionally  long story short  she got run over  we got her treated  this morning we found her dead  i already had serious depression  family is already struggling to bind itself  ive got no interest at all with nothing or nobody  i already had fear  about loneliness  about my father  and now i fear even more  i fear that he will age more quickly  that he will not fulfill his obligations  we could lose our house  i fear that he will die soon too  if he dies i swear i kill myself in the moment  i have already lurked and sadly  posted here   i know i will not kill myself now  so if any of you wasted time reading this rn  please go help more critical people  i just don t have anyone to tell this  to tell my problems  yo relief what i feel  and just wanted to note this somewhere  im just convinced more and more and more to the point im     sure that i will have myself killed on some point  i just want to die but also im concerned about my dad and i have plenty of fear ,1
i think the main reason why i dont kill myself is because i dont want my cats to be sad title sounds like a joke  its not   me     years old and ive never  not once in my adult life  felt that i belonged anywhere  my childhood wasnt bad  no abuse or anything like that   but my parents divorced shortly after i was born  i have no memory of them being together  looking back  i spent a lot of it being passed around  sometimes im living with my mother  sometimes with my father  sometimes with my grandparents  meanwhile  no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond  they were just keeping me alive  my parents were young and stupid  both were    when i was born   my grandparents were giving  but distant  they gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a tv   at some point  around ten years old i developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence  i couldnt even say my own name  i remember being    and    and wondering how the hell i was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk  i was seriously thinking that i would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work  it was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence    today  im still a stutterer  but i can work with it  stuttering is awful when youre young and arent yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity    when youve lived with it for awhile though and youve been around the block  you can get good at hiding it  you get better at choosing your words  you also care less about everyone accepting you  with that burden off your shoulders  a stutterer can get by all right  even when you have the odd tremor  its more a conversation piece than an embarrassment    yet  i still feel like i dont belong anywhere in this world  i never joined the rest of the world  i have no real friends  family connections are tenuous  the family i was closest to are all dead  my mother passed on christmas day       due to liver disease from her heavy drinking  my grandmother passed in         i thought i would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time i reached my   s  but im not  and i dont know why  maybe ive made my bed here and i dont know how to make it anywhere else   one thing that i can say about myself is that im not angry  i dont want to hurt anyone  i dont hate anyone  my situation is no ones fault  except mine  and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine  my story isnt anything special   ive just always been sad  i dont know how to be anything other than sad  and i hide it  i hate the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so i keep them bottled up  i cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much i like the people im around   ive thought about suicide  ive stared at pill bottles  ive given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub    but ive never done it  never even tried    my feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after youve exhausted every last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive  hate your life  change it  quit your job  get a new one  change your habits  talk to someone  even if its a bartender  start painting  start a blog  learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something  come up with a goal  even if its very modest and silly  if its not self destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time  its a good thing  maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish   last year  when i was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast  i reached out for my idea of a life line   i adopted a cat   a young cat  five months old  a girl with a lot of life left in her    i brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment  she jumped into my lap and went to sleep   and i started crying  overcome with emotion  i knew right then that i loved her  and that no matter how sad i am  i need to live so that i can take care of her    a few months later  i thought that she could use another kitty friend so i adopted another cat  a little boy  a few months younger than her    after a rough first week  they eventually became friends and i now love them both equally  in fact  all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want i shower on these two cats  they get nothing but endless affection from me  i only buy them the best  most healthy food  according to my research  at least   i talk to them and play with them daily  if i somehow won an all expenses paid trip to paris or somewhere today  i honestly dont think i would want it  as sad it may sound  id miss my cats too much    a cats love is interesting  they place no importance on pleasing you  so they dont cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command  at least my cats wont   sometimes they do though  and its amazing  cats look at you as their servant  which  to me  is funny and cute and a role that im happy to fill  it keeps me sane in a weird way   meanwhile  cats do become attached to you  mine follow me everywhere  they sleep next to me  or on me  in my bed  if something scares them  the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm   they run to me for protection  we hide together underneath a blanket   i love them so  so much   they havent cured my depression  but they have given me something to live for  the thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesnt love them as much as i do all because i had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about  they belong with me and i belong to them    and my cats are both young  my little girl is a year and three months  my little boy is about to turn      helping them live long  healthy lives has become my goal  these cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years  and i need to be here to serve them    i cant kill myself  ive got a job to do  ,1
does anyone else think about suicide death a lot but won t actually do anything  i just feel like death is constantly in my mind  i wonder when it will be  i wonder if it ll hurt and what happens after  i often fantasize about dying in a horrible accident that way it wouldn t be as bad as suicide to my family  just to think whenever i m driving it s just a pull towards a tree and i wonder what s stopping me    i m not trying to promote this thinking at all  just wondering if anyone else gets these thoughts  it s just like death wont leave me alone  ,1

i fucked up my body and my life thinking i was transgender  go into my post history for the full story  im too exhausted to type all of it back up   tl dr  i thought i was transgender  took testosterone injections for over a year  realized i was just a masculine androgynous woman  dealing with the fallout   i am now a woman with a deep ish voice  horrible acne scars all over my back  thinning hair  an enlarged downstairs  profuse body hair  deformed breasts  and facial hair   i feel like a fucking freak  it was a long  horrible road realizing i made a mistake and was not trans  but a road i drove down much too late  i can deal with most of it alright  body hair can be shaved if i so desire to  i can raise my voice pitch through voice training  there are creams or whatever for the acne scarring  my thinning hair is actually regrowing since i stopped injections a few months ago   but my genitals and breasts will never be the same  i cant remove my facial hair permanently without spending several hundred dollars  i am very broke   i have permanently mutilated myself with these injections  ironically  they were supposed to make me feel  more aligned  with who  i truly am  but for me  it was really just a desperate attempt to slap a bandaid on the gaping wound which is my body dysmorphia and deep rooted self image problems   and to make matters even more delightful  there exist certain individuals who take my suffering and twist it to fit whatever political agenda suits them  trans people hate me because they think i give them a bad name and discredit medical transition  evangelicals and terfs love me because they want to use me to discredit medical transition   i dont want my pain to be misappropriated for someone elses vindicative internet posts  i dont want my story used to harm real trans people    i hate my stupid fucking deformed body and i just want to go back in time and kill my past self so that she never ever takes that first testosterone shot  never has to feel this pain  its abysmal staring myself down in the mirror every day  to see the effects this powerful drug has had on my poor body   i have been suicidal for many years but lately i just feel something evil growing inside me  something which will give me the power to end my own life before my rational brain can talk me down  i have no job  im actually on the comedown of a terrible lsd trip  im a budding alcoholic and binge eater  no one will ever love me like this  its not like ive got a great personality to make up for my physical flaws  im depressing and condescending without realizing it    the world would just be better off without people like me in it  im a fucking joke  to the kids out there questioning your gender  talk to a fucking therapist first  for the love of god  dont be me  ,1

does anyone else feel suicidal almost everyday but not act on it ever  when i say not act on it i mean ive never self harmed  never attempted any kind of suicide or damage  but everyday i wake up feeling like whats the point  the main reason i havent is fear in case i mess it up and i am in pain or disabled for the rest of my life and the other is letting people down  worried my fiance and mum would blame themselves   i highly doubt i would ever do it but this is the worst i have ever felt  i have been fine for a while  got engaged just   weeks ago but now i am bad again   just looking for people in similar situations to talk to ,1
wrote many posts here and its like the reality  always ignored  no matter what  this probably upsets me the most   ,1
i failed a couple of days ago  i finally decided to end my life  i decided  after years of being suicidal  that nothing is worth it anymore  so i went into the shower  put on some chill music  and sat there for a long  long time  long enough for the water to get freezing cold  i used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there  staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin  when i finally got out  i put on my dirty ass pajamas i d been wearing for a week  and went into my room  i tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop  as i felt the belt tightening around my neck  my fight or flight instinct kicked in and i freaked the fuck out  i immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck  i couldn t get it back over my head and i was hyperventilating  when i finally got it off  i was just shaking like a leaf  i sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time  i ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened  and they came into my room  took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug  but now  i m sitting here  in my school parking lot  avoiding going to class  and i m regretting calling her at all  i wish i had just waited until i calmed down enough to try again  i don t want to be here  i don t want to be alive  and now i m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else  i fucking hate this  i just want to drive my car off of a bridge  i can t do this anymore  maybe when i go home i ll gather all the pills i can find and try again  i can t go into school  i can t face the fucktards i call  friends   i can t face the people who were supposed to be there for me  i just want to go home  not back to my house  back to where i came from  i want to go back to the earth  i want to become one with the universe again  i want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again  i wanna be stardust   edit  i m okay now  i m out of crisis mode and i m just trying to take each day as it comes  thank you so much for your kind words and support  it s helped a lot  thank you  ,1
it really sucks to have realized that life is meaningless at such a young age i realized it when i was     i m    now  there really is no point  you grow up  you get a job  you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it  then you die  it s really sad because i wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isn t  the only reason i haven t killed myself yet is because of how sad i know my mom and dad would be  i couldn t do that to them  they are so loving and they work so hard in this meaningless life just to do the same thing every other mid level family does  i probably won t ever kill myself  im too much of a pussy  but god does it suck always wanting to be dead   thanks for all the support from everyone   it has made me a bit happy to know that a lot of people understand  if you d like  my whole situation is on my other post on my profile  give it a read if you really want to understand what i m going thru ,1
my depression has made me become such a good liar  it s frightening  when you tell everyone you re okay but you re actually not    you promise them you won t do something  but your mind tells you otherwise    it s hurts being under such intense emotional pain    it s hard seeming like you re the happiest person out there and fully functioning but know deep down inside while you re alone that you re so fucking unhappy  so fucking unhappy   ,1
  f alone and no motivation or hope for the future i ve been in bed all day  my mind has gone to a really dark place and i ve been daydreaming about all of the different ways i could end my life  my cat hasn t left my side  this isn t really typical for her and she s usually pretty independent  she is currently lying on my stomach and seems to be trying to comfort me  i don t deserve her and she is probably the only keeping me from making an attempt  ,1
the fact that i have to go to sleep  and then wake up and watch the time pass as i am stuck with my thoughts  makes me want to just go ahead and kill myself this instant   ,1
do you ever want to just fade away  to fade away like the smoke from a cigarette and no longer trouble myself or others  for all the memories im involved in to disappear with me and all traces of my existence gone  thats what i wish for    i dont want to have to deal with this mess ive created anymore and i dont want anyone else to have to clean it up after me  why cant i just disappear  it would be so much easier for all  ,1
nobody even reads my sw posts i m tired of being the stupid kid that can t fit in  i m tired of being lonely and having no friends  i m tired of always being the worthless piece of shit no one cares about    i just want to die  nobody would care if i killed myself  i wish i just did it in sixth grade  ,1
people only care after we are dead  honestly the worst part of the process of recovering from mental illness  is no one cares enough to lend a helping hand despite knowing our situation except the one person you re paying money to  the therapist  and then once we actually are gone  they start caring  until then we are alone in the fight  and are judged for not getting through the storm alone    i wish it was different but it feels like i am a laughing stock and stepping stone for people to trample on as some trash along the road  it s great  ,1
you ever just have everything going for you  but you fuck it all up  life was going well for me  high school was a breeze  i got into a good university for engineering  i had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend bestfriend    i fucked it all up   it began with me being lazy in university  i procrastinated many assignments to the point where i ended a quarter with   fs  i try to fix my grades by the end of the school year  still have gpa above      so not kicked out yet  however  my fafsa application was declined because of the poor performance  that was the only way i could afford classes as i did not want to go in debt   i decide to do work and earn money  i got a job at mcdonalds and  luckily  did not have to work in service  only production  which is great since im introverted  i work there for   months and decide to quit one day  thought id be able to find a better paying job  but that proved to be more difficult than i imagined    that same year  i had relationship issues  around the end of february of last year  i found out my gf had cheated  though  it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy  i decided to forgive her and continue  fast forward to may       she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him  im too in love  so i decide to give her another chance    week later  i catch her sending nudes to the same guy  i forgive her again    december       same time i quit my job  im unemployed    months since the last time my gf did anything  i had been with her for   years  this was the one year it was bad   im looking for jobs  but no one is interested  im struggling   january          year old honda begins to die  im left without a car for a month  girlfriend decides to leave me  to be clear  she meant the world to me  she was the only one close to me   im heartbroken  in a desperate attempt to save our relationship  i walk to her place     miles away  a   hour walk  i promise everything   that everything would get better  and i would fix myself and our relationship  im rejected  im starting to lose it    i cant live in this world without her  she was the only one  the only reason i kept going  we talked of marriage and our future plans a lot  it was a set path  and just like that  its gone  february       the last time we talk   i have no one to talk to  she was the only one i could talk to about my personal problems  i had no other close friends  my relationship with my family is almost nonexistent  im stuck with all this hurt  and have no way to let it all out  i begin to hang out with my friends online  and begin to hang out with them irl  i tell them about my break up   that sucks   they say  thats all i get  i expected as much      march       me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse  pay is decent and job isnt that demanding  i could do this   since the break up  however  i havent felt happy at all  i struggle sleeping  any thought of her would just make me depressed  theres no escape from her  so many things remind me of her  i cant listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it  i break down one day and decide to message her  i explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person  no response     weeks after getting that warehouse job  i get fired  i hadnt shown up for   days without notice   im a failure   same week  i learned that someone had stolen my identity back in       i learned about this after doing taxes and stuff  irs stated that i owed        from       i was    years old then  i didnt work  so i have that to deal with now  on top of that  i owe        for my car   recently  ive found out my ex has moved on to someone else  there goes my chances of ever fixing that again  to add  being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom i loved to hang out with  since shes no longer with me  im no longer friends with them  they were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school   so now  im a lonely  lazy  desperate  struggling failure that wants to end it all  i have a history of cutting  i cut so deep freshman year that i have huge scars on my left arm     years later  i almost committed suicide by stabbing myself  but i pussied out  after what happened to me and my ex in may       i tried committing suicide again through overdose  unfortunately i lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family    i could have stayed in university if i had just done my homework  i could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner  i could be making money if i wasnt a quitter  im worthless    ive tried so hard no to think about suicide  but it seems to be the one thing i desire most now  i have nothing going for me  my relationship with other people isnt strong enough for me to stay  if i live  im only going to live in regret   wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything  i want to die so bad  im only     but i dont think im going to make it to     ,1
declining people suicide  is a lot like forcing someone into a car  never letting them out until the car breaks down  and getting pissed off that they want out   ,1
what else can i do instead of suicide  could i run away to some obscure country  would i leave my old identity behind leave my mum make a missing person report   should i just do something completely fucking stupid and fuck my life up more  at least if everyone knows i m useless then they won t expect anything good from me and i ll be left alone    i don t want to kill myself that badly but i don t want to continue living  not like this    my situation isn t even that bad  i just can t get this anxiety  insecurity  overthinking  depression out of my fucking head  for years and years i ve been trapped  maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse    i just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore  im tired       socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head  and all i want is friends and a partner but all i do is lose friends and isolate myself because i m fucked in the head  i just don t know what to do  i feel like maybe i ve got some undiagnosed autism or something because i just feel like my brain works differently and i just dont know what to do about     of the time  my  cool confidence  is completely fake  i m just trying to fake it till i make it but it s obviously fake  i just embarrass myself again and again    maybe i m asking for advice  maybe i m venting  this subreddit is so great  i can relate to so many other sad souls and that makes me feel a little bit better   edit  thanks for all the great replies everyone  i wish i could give a meaningful reply to all of them but it would take too long     you all ,1

were all suicidal people who tell other people to stay alive in most cases  thats the truth  ,1
does anyone else love sleeping because you get either dreams or a sense of nothingness  both of which feel better than being awake  i sleep a lot  as much as i can   feels good to fade away and stop existing for a while   when i have dreams i dream i m a normal  happy person  i dreamed recently this girl i used to know was my girlfriend  she was having dinner at my place with my family  my parents looked so proud   if i don t dream  the sense of oblivion is great too    maybe that s why i want to die so bad  it s basically just sleeping forever  ,1
does anyone else feel a sense of calm and peace when thinking about suicide  i do  and it scares me  i used to feel panicked and anxious when thinking about suicide and  which would end up in a decent crying session   for a while now however  i just feel calm and relieved when thinking about it  its nice to feel that theres always a solution available if things go badly wrong  or if im too stressed  when all my life ive only heard to just suck it up and keep moving on to fuck things up all over again   i just want to know if anyone else has had this  because thinking like that scares me  i dont want to end it  i know my family cares about me  and i dont want them to suffer   ive had these thoughts for a long time now  the difference is that i dont think negatively about suicide now   thank you for taking the time for reading  please share your thoughts experience if you can and want to  it would help me feel im not alone  ,1
fuck it  i quit  i m out  i m just keep going in circles  same olé bullshit every day  why because  oh you gotta accomplish goals so you can brag about what you have done with your life  you gotta work and pay bills you know  and buy new things buy buy buy  because you gotta keep our economy moving     it s all just a fucking sham  we thinking we re all special  naw  we re just like bugs  when you kill a bug does the world stops  nope  it keeps going  only reason people care is how big you are  what s your worth how important you are to them otherwise you could be dying in the gutter and no one will give a fuck about you  just because we can build stuff and we can drive around in metal boxes  we think we re special  i don t feel special  i just feel like a number  i m tired of this crap  no one really gives a fuck  everyone is for themselves    it s all just a fucking sham  ,1
im burning my suicide plans   notes today once i get out of bed  im burning all of my plans and notes today   ive spent countless hours planning my death  saving up money and cleaning everything  i cant live like this anymore    i cant live to die   this is a huge step  im scared  ,1
ever cried so quietly that the people sitting next to you dont notice  sometimes tears start falling down my face because i just cant stop them  i have so much pain inside me that it come out randomly when i least want it to    i was sitting in the living room with my family and i started crying over something my friend said in jest  i just sat there while my  family  went on with whatever they were doing  they dont give a fuck about me  i feel constantly ignored  invalidated  pushed away  silenced and neglected  nothing i say is taken seriously  my feelings are cast aside  ive stopped trying to make them see how hurt i am  their just too blind  no one cares about me   if i die  no one will care  so why not do it  not like theres anyone stopping me  i have access to knives  ropes  ladders  a body of water and strong medicine  i have options on how i want to die   no one will miss me  no point in stating in this fucking dimension  ,1

mental hospitals never work so a bit of backstory  in my state  if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others  can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital  for a max of   days  after going to the er to check if youve tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist  for at least    minutes     this has happened to me twice  the first time  i only got assessed by the psychologist for about    minutes but thankfully i was released after a few hours   the second time however  was much worse  so i went to the er  had to stay overnight  wasnt seen by a psychologist until   days later after being sent to the mental hospital  which im     sure is illegal   also  i didnt get registered into the mental hospitals system until   hours after i arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff  not to mention while in the er  i overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients  while in the mental hospital place  i never actually got better  i just trained myself to be all smiley and happy  because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed     x   b   tldr  mental hospitals cut corners  dont care about you  and teach you to repress and hide your feelings   edit  some other bs at happened at the second time  which was at a university hospital  btw  included    because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder    my mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse  the nurse hung up and said  im sorry  but this is getting annoying  right to my face   a diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend  so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches   while at the er  i overheard nurses service techs complain about the mental health patients  ,1
i wish i would get a terminal illness so i could die without having to kill myself  ,1
i wish i could die without killing myself like i wish i could just get into an accident and die then that way i wouldn t have to do it myself  idk it s fucked up to think that but i think about it all the time ,1
i deserve to die because i ve done awful things not saying what they were  they were not things i knew were wrong till later  if i had known then how much it would hurt people i would never ever done it  i don t want to hurt anyone  but i have and i haven t meant to  so all my suffering now is punishment for doing the awful things i didn t know were awful till much later  ,1
self harm and substance abuse are not causes  they are symptoms  im sick of people focusing on stuff that will return if you you dont help with the main issue  its like taking away a kids phone cause they are suicidal ,1

im sick and tired of people telling me  youre too young to be depressed  i am    years old  my dad committed suicide when i was    as he was a stay at home dad  i had so much experience with playing with him and talking in general  i havent really talked to many people or made relationships with anyone following that event  seemingly every week some adult is telling me that im too young to be depressed  like damn when did they make an age cap  ive thought about suicide for the last   years but have only tried once  which failed bad  but recently with people comparing depression to my age constantly it makes me want to try again   thanks for reading  edits  hey guys  i just want to thank you all so much for the     positive messages you have sent me  i never expected i would get more help in under    hours than i ever had in   years  as much as this makes me happy  it also comes to my concern s that there are some horrible people browsing this reddit  i have received multiple messages telling me to do certain things to myself  here is an example  https   imgur com gallery tdycb ,1
life is like a video game you dont want to play anymore or a book you dont want to read anymore  the idea of suicide feels like pressing the pause stop button on a video game  after sometime you just dont feel like playing the game anymore  you dont stop playing a video game or stop reading a book because of depression or loneliness  you stop simply because you dont wish to carry on  it could be because of boredom repetitiveness  it could be because of the high difficulty  of course you could start playing a different game or you could read a different book but can we do that in real life  does anyone feel the same way  ,1

vote up if you think i should live  ha  title is some humour because intergalactic laws dont matter right now  i dont think i will be alive much longer  a month away seems very far  my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone  the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself  it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle   i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost   the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel  i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible  this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more   i wont be letting anyone know  part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me  everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me  none of them interacted with me how expected   so i wont be telling anyone  they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication  at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone   and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you  etc    i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me  the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford  i cant afford rent either  i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work  i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring  there is no real support either  not unless you pay them which isnt real support imho either  i was seeing a therapist  stopped two weeks ago ,1
anyone else have literally no one to speak to irl and wish they did  but at the same time feel like talking about problems is completely pointless   ,1
my parents are emotionally abusive and im thinking about killing myself hello  im depressed  i want to say im an introvert but i really am not  i love being with people  laughing with people  sharing stories with others  but im unable to relate to anyone  i feel alone  i have my family but thats the problem  my parents are the problem  ever since i was young they were overly protective of me and never allowed me to go out with friends or have sleepovers with our neighbors  this left me with the disability to socialize well  i am now unable to relate with others  i dont know how to talk  i dont know how to form a bond with others  the worst part is my parents dont give me any attention  every time i talk to them i feel like theyre not treating me like im a child and i dont deserve to talk to them  everytime i open up about being lonely they just tell me to  grow up  and stop being emotional  im already     i feel so confused  i feel sad  i cry often  the only things that put a smile on my face are my dogs  video games  and netflix  other than that i have nothing  no one  i want to be a strong person and be capable of living without attention from others but i doubt im capable of that  im very emotional  from the past few months suicide was always on my mind  thats probably because i feel really lonely  and also because i want my parents to emotionally suffer too  because thats what they did to me   edit   sorry if i cant respond to your comments  i just want to say thank you to all of you  you guys are actually willing to help me and that made me feel important  thank you guys  ,1
im killing myself on my   th birthday i dont care how my family will feel anymore  i dont care how sad my boyfriend will get  i will never be happy and ive come to terms with that  ive been suicidal since i was a kid for some unknown reason  i wanted to walk into traffic  ive been self harming since i was   or   without really knowing it  im angry at everyone all the time and cant talk to someone without being belittled or causing anxiety  ive gone through therapy and tried pills  ive been hospitalized and nothing works  ive planned it and im in the process of writing my note to my boyfriend  i hate myself and everyone in my life  i hate myself so much  i really cant do it anymore  dont try to convince me otherwise it will not work  ,1
 talk to someone  yeah i did and its pointless  rant talking doesnt make anything better  it just means one more person knows how fucked up and far gone i am  and they cant do anything about it  ive come to realise that theres no hope and im better off alone until i can go through with completion  fuck my brain and demons  i cant wait until i delete myself from the gene pool  such a rejected waste of fucking oxygen and space ,1
im waking up tomorrow  i was sure of it  tonight was supposed to be night  my depression was always there  but something told me that tonight was the night i would end it all and relieve myself from this pain   but i didnt    i found myself crying for   hours  and then finally picking up the phone for the suicide hotline  i spoke to the most wonderful person on the other end  he told me i was strong  he told me i deserved to live  he told me i was a good person  he gave me a new perspective on how to tackle life  he saved my life   so  for now  i put the tools away  the notes away  and will not send those texts tonight  because  for better or worse   im waking up tomorrow  ,1

i tried to kill myself at my best friends birthday party my friend threw her birthday party at her house and it was super small  just me  another friend and the birthday girl  her parents left for the night so we each got a bottle of vodka  i m pretty light weight but finished my bottle  i got a little rowdy and knocked a cup over and spilt some water  the birthday girl got super mad and made me sit in her room for a while  maybe about an hour  i locked myself in the bathroom and decided to grab a knife from the kitchen  after i got back to the bathroom i tried to stab myself in the stomach so that maybe i would bleed out and die  they stopped me before i could  they told my parents and i got grounded  it spread around school and nobody really talks to me anymore like they used to  i feel like everyone s scared of me and i don t know what to do about it  i feel like some sort of psycho for trying that  all my friends have left me  i wasn t depressed before but i am now   so sorry if you had to read through all that haha  just had to get it off my chest ,1
i wish i could trade places with someone who is dying and wants to live i feel like this is a super shitty thing to say and probably insensitive    i don t have anyone to talk to that i can trust and i need to say it somewhere  i desperately want to trade places with someone who has covid    or even like cancer or anything else  so they could get a second chance at life and my suffering could finally be over  i don t want to be alive and haven t since i was    or     it s not fair that some people who are so full of life and happiness have to die while miserable people like me still exist  i m a waste of resources and a drain on society  if i was given the opportunity to die in someone s place i would jump at the chance  not really looking for responses or anything    just had to put this out there and nobody in my life gives a shit how i feel  ,1

my therapist said i had over   lives worth of trauma packed into my    years  i dont think the bad times stop  im ready to go  hi there  my name is anna  im   f  this post is going to be incoherent  because i cant really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore  i dont expect anyone to read this  and if you do  im sorry     ive got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different    the one person i told everything too is so tired  i love him very much  but i know caring about me is a burden  he needs more consistency  stability  and sustainability   things i dont think i can offer with my brain   i think this is a vent  but also the closest thing to a suicide now that i have  its just the truth of my life  and why im ready for it to be over    i was raped at the ages of              and     some of those years included multiple times  ive been kidnapped   sold  ive been a victim in a shooting  ive been forced to watch children die  murdered   i found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten  ive been severely stalked  i watched my mother lose her battle with cancer  ive had friends murdered in college  ive been severely beaten  hungry starved  homeless  theres been so much  and im so  so tired    if anything  i just want boring years where nothing happens  but i dont think thats possible  everyone says the bad times dont last  that others have had it worse  im just so tired  im so tired of hearing these things from people who dont have to live with my brain or experiences  people tell me im so strong but i feel so weak   i dont want to fight to live  i dont want to survive anymore  i wouldnt even call this a crisis because im just so ready  so calm and numb   if my guy sees this  im sorry i couldnt give you everything you needed  im sorry i couldnt get better   take care of the cats for me  i hope you find happiness  comfort  warmth and love       see you  space cowboy  ,1
i hate  it gets better  i was told that continually during my lowest points  but its only gotten so much worse  so much so that my lowest points now seem like my highest  sometimes it doesnt get better i cant fucking stand this ,1
i am a ghost i deleted everything  this is the only social media im still active on  everything else is gone  i cut all ties  i havent talked to freinds in days  i feel completely invisible  but i like it this way  i no longer have to make an ass of myself in front of loved ones  maybe this is a better alternative to suicide    or maybe the first step  ,1
i m    and my life is over    i was finally becoming happy  i had a job i loved  i was coming to terms with my family troubles and leaving them behind  i ve made friends better than any i ve ever had before and yet i am depressed  i used to think i was depressed an anxious the whole way though high school  i wasn t depressed  i was sad  maybe more than my friends yes  but not depressed  and i wasn t anxious  i was just a nervous kid and i forced myself out of my comfort zone and overcame my nervousness      months ago  i got tinnitus  an incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head  for   months i was coping with it  until january  i began to develop hypercausis  a side effect of the condition  this side effect is extremely severe  it causes me to perceive normal sound as painful  i am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable  around the same time i developed and anxiety disorder  my heart now constantly pounds in my chest and i have frequent panic attacks    i haven t heard silence in   months  and i never will again   my heart hasn t stopped pounding for   months  and it never will again   this is not living  this is coping   all the positive thinking in the world isn t going to cure me  nothing will   i have good friends and a family who care about me  but it doesn t matter  none of it does  ,1
im tired of trying on mobile so sorry about formatting  like the title says  im sick of getting up everyday at the crack of dawn to go to a job that pays too little and get my ass chewed for   hours straight everyday  nothing makes me happy anymore  getting out of bed in the morning feels like climbing a mountain alone  anything i try to do for entertainment is only a momentary release from this shithole we live in  i feel defeated  i use to have ambitions  goals  dreams  but now i cant even imagine a world where i can be happy  i dont want to continue on  working the same crappy job to go home to the same crappy parents that i cant move out from since i cant make enough money  i have no friends outside of work  things look monochrome constantly  i dont know how much longer i can keep doing this  ,1
better  i am better  just wanted to put it in writing  i played football today and studied well  i am meant to be dead but i stayed  introduced meditation exercise and immense focus on my thoughts    this is a war but i am starting to win a lot more battles  i don t see this as the end  but the beginning of something better  ,1
my friend just shot himself in the head and we are left with nothing but questions and misery there s really nothing to say   he had a beautiful five year old child and parents who cared about him and friends who are now very fucking pissed off   this is bullshit   i m sitting here on reddit because there is nothing to do or say   he was a great friend and the only person who didn t criticize me or call me a coward for attempting suicide   he would always say  me too bro   it hurts every day    and now he s gone   fuck you  ,1
every single morning that i wake up i become upset that i m still alive   ,1
life isnt a gift  its a burden rather  ,1
did you ever realize  that nobody in your life actually gives a fuck about you  not one person genuinely cares or makes an effort of any way towards your relationship or friendship  that while you re sure they would cry if you killed yourself  they would soon get over it and move on  because despite the love and connection you feel towards them  nobody feels that way towards you  despite the lengths you would go for anybody and everybody at all  nobody would so much as cross a shallow puddle to make you feel welcomed on this earth    cause yeah folks  that sucks  ,1
i didnt fucking ask to be here  this is what infuriates me   you cant kill yourself  think of how it will hurt your family   i didnt fucking ask to be in this situation  if you had given me a choice  i would have said no thanks  now because i had the misfortune of existing  i have to suffer through the rest of my life for other people  fuck that  i love my family  in fact thats precisely why i hate life  knowing my mom is going to die and everyone else i love is going to die  life fucking blows  i would do anything to just cease existing  ,1
does anybody else feel like suicide is their inevitable destiny ive always felt that id never have to work a full time job or go through college because i have this constant  recurring feeling of fate that ill eventually kill myself  anyone else have this feeling  ,1
thinking of killing myself comforts me because if everything gets too much to handle  i always have a choice to way out  i dont know if anyone else feels this way  but lately ive been thinking about suicide a lot and it really makes me feel better that i can always make the choice when i want to  and that i dont need to deal with any consequences that come after  although it might sound selfish  ,1
living with suicidal ideation is like having to put killing yourself on the bottom of your checklist for the day and hoping you don t get everything done like  i  f    want to live  i want to be happy and normal  and i know people are like  there is no normal  we all get sad   but since puberty i have heard voices  pulled out my hair  self harmed  been generally anxious and extremely emotional  and always suicidal   but my therapists and psychiatrists and parents and friends just tell me to make a list  i get overwhelmed easily and my brain immediately goes to  just die  but they say making a list helps  so i try  and i put it on the bottom of my list everyday  for example  tomorrow    breakfast coffee  homework  shower   clean  work  homework  commit suicide  and if i get tired at any time  i just go to sleep and start over again  but dying is always at the end of my list  its worked for me so far  i m a great procrastinator  so just putting it off until the next day helps me survive    i know sometimes it seems death is grabbing you by the nostrils and screaming in your face to just do it  but i m talking about just day to day life  ,1
i feel like i lie and fake all my issues and i hate it i feel like i make everything up and don t truly have any issues or need any help ,1
i just wish i could die a tragic death without me killing myself a lot has gone wrong i ll just leave it at that ,1
mom just basically told me to go to hell and she s not listening to me anymore  next time the house is free i am going to prepare me suicide method  this is it i m finally taking the next step  what a fucking horrible way to treat someone you know is suicidal  edit  a lot of comments are abusing my mom and saying to cut her off  she cares for me but she had left me crying and hadn t literally said  go to hell   i used that term perhaps colloquially and she basically told me that she isn t sticking around to listen to me and stick around to hear me refuse to do anything  she merely left me alone in my room to hurt while she went to make dinner for my brother or whatever  i apologize to those who took it literally  bad communication on my part ,1
my mom attempted suicide today tw  kind of graphic description of suicide attempt     so at around midnight on         i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn t breathing  i immediately got up and went outside  i went into the backyard and into the garage  where my step father was trying really hard to give her cpr  she tried to kill herself by hanging  she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling  and wrapped it around her neck  thankfully because of how poor her attempt was  she wasn t fully hanging off of the ground  and was mostly on the ground  we don t know how long she was out there and we don t know how long her airway had been cut off  anyway  as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath  the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her  they took her away into the ambulance and my brother  me  and my step father got ready to go to the hospital  eventually we ended up in the er waiting for answers about my mom  they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead  however  they took her to get a ct scan of her brain  and they then told us that they don t see any significant damage to the brain  no swelling or bleeding  and her neck was not injured significantly  i m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn t worse  after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her  talk to her a little  and then go home  when we were able to go see her i went in first  she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma  i don t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery  all we know as of right now       am on          is that she is stable but in critical condition  and now we re just waiting for her to wake up  i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable  the only thing i m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it  and with her asthma and obesity she s more at risk of complications   you really don t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens  i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven t been able to even think about sleeping  i m ending my vent here  i love you mom  please wake up   ,1
if youre upset about the election  the place to seek help is not by inviting discussion about it on the internet  including here  we know that the us election results are adding to the burden of fear and despair that many of you are carrying   but this particular election has brought a lot of legitimate rage to the surface  and secondarily given others an excuse to unleash indiscriminate aggression against the most vulnerable people they can find   we know that for some of you tonight might feel like the last straw   its completely understandable that youd want help  but the wide open internet is not the place to seek it right now   due to the amount of brigading  abuse  and argument theyre attracting  were taking down all political posts     please seek mental health support through true crisis resources  which we are not   the sidebar community info has links if you need them    ,1

anybody else feel permanently fucked up  even if i tried to get my shit together and put any effort into fixing my life  i m already seriously behind and my brain doesn t work right  which would just make it all even harder than it should be  trauma seems to have had a serious impact on my ability to do simple tasks  remember things  focus  or be a reliable person in general  it s been a while since anything terrible has happened to me  and yet i m still fucked in the head  i feel like it s gonna be this way forever  why even try  ,1

how come i cant choose suicide as an option   serious  basically the title  every time i or some one i know talks about suicide its always an unacceptable choice that no one can ever make  why   i didnt ask to be here  i dont want to be here  why do others get to dictate when i can go   i understand trying to overcome depression and other mental illnesses that play into suicidal thoughts  but what if im sick of trying  or i just dont care  or i have tried and failed so many times that i feel its hopeless   im not trying to trigger anyone having these same thoughts  i just genuinely dont want to be alive  i find no joy  excitement or purpose in it and want it to be over  why do i not get that choice  ,1

i didnt kill myself thanks to this subreddit     you guys   days ago on saturday  i decided to kill myself  wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain i would cause to my family and friends  i just woke up that morning and realised i could not take another fucking day  i was going to wait till my parents were asleep  than i was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky  funny thing was the knowledge that i was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while    i didnt do anything special  same old shit  i even finished off a school assignment for some reason  i dont know why  played xbox  went to gym  went for a run  talked to a few people on skype  walked my dog  had dinner  dinner was weird  thinking it was my last meal  said goodbye to my dog  told her i hoped other people would walk her when i was gone  said goodnight to my parents for what i thought would be the last time  hugged my grandma goodnight  went to my room and locked the door  decided to smoke some weed one last time  by then it was about       and i knew my parents were going to sleep at about       so i had some time to kill  said i ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself  went to this subreddit  read through all the top submissions and realised i had never tried to fight this  i had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when  it helped that i was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me i was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort  took   sleeping pills  my usual dose  and passed out    the next day was shit  still as depressed as ever  still wanted to kill myself  but i legitimately tried to get better  and by the end of the day i had smiled without faking it for the first time in months  i felt happy for a little bit  and i realised that i would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again  it was just a simple thing  my dog licking me on the nose while i was listening to some music  in the days that followed things havent improve much but i haven t legitimately considered suicide since   i m determined to beat this one way or another  i m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not  but whatever happens  you guys saved me from killing myself that night    much love   ,1
you know what is hard to do when you are suicidal  work   i have to fight for my life and my job  exhausting  ,1
killing myself is a permanent solution to a permanent problem  depression is a lifelong illness that cannot be cured  it can only be suppressed and treated  i hate everything  i dont enjoy anything  i hate life  i hate my family  i have nothing i am good at or enjoy  no reason to live  nothing to strive for  nothing to gain  i dont have any reason to live   i dont love anything or anyone enough to stay  i just want to die and see what happens afterward  i have no obligation to live this life fully  and if there is nothing after death then thats great   i have no goals for this life  at least my death will be a step in the right direction  nobody will have to deal with me ever again  ,1
why are we only appreciated when we re finally gone  for fucks sake  it bothers me how many people say such kind words at funerals of people who killed themselves  why couldn t you say that when they were alive   most of the time they felt so unloved they wanted to take their own life  because no one stopped to say that they appreciate them  that s at least how i feel   i don t know if i believe in some kind of afterlife  whether it be heaven or living out a life as a ghost  but part of me wants to kill myself  just to be able to watch my own funeral  call me an attention whore  i get it  but god damn  how do people really feel about me  and how many people are faking it  i want to know if my father tells the truth when he says he couldn t live without me  i want to know if my mother can finally say that she loves me at my own funeral  i wonder what kind of words my only two friends will say  and i want to see if they actually cared  if they actually were my friends    there s so much i want to know  and all of it is basically craving to know that someone gives a shit  and if killing myself is the only way of giving myself a chance to see that  why shouldn t i  ,1
     of people regretted it   please  i planned that overdose for so damn long  even got myself an alibi  enough to kill at least three people  but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me  legit  when i was passing out  i have never been so happy  so relieved  that everything was finally going to be over  the first time i attempted  i was fourteen and i was so happy when i passed out and thought it was over  every time  even   can you imagine how angry and disappointed i was this time when i woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so i  wasnt a danger to myself   for nearly three days i was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because i was  hysterical  and  dangerous  and  agitated  and all those words to describe someone who just really really really wanted to die  three weeks later in the psychiatric ward  most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because i refused medication  its easier to pacify someone who isnt given the right to function  i suppose  now im back out on suicide watch   i dont understand how someone can put people through shit like that  for their own good   well  i guess it worked in a fucked up way  now i want to die more than ive ever wanted to  but im so fucking terrified its going to go wrong and ill be locked up   left to rot tied to the bed again because ive been in the hospital so many times that they just dont know what to do with me  why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer  i have not reached out for help  ive only tried to die on my own terms  and i get treated like a violent criminal  do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a  hospital  against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you   why the fuck do people do this to other people  its so much worse than dying  and now theyve even taken away the last freedom i thought i had  i really dont want to live  but im too scared to try to die  i cant go through that again  maybe         of people regretted it  but for ten long years ive never once regretted it  they dont believe me  though  they just lock me up and throw me back out when theyve given up or when im  stable   im not a person to them  im just cattle that comes in  gets processed and punished if i resist  and thrown back out  nobody gives a fuck about me  and nobody does anything if i complain because every record tells how  hysterical  and  dangerous  and  agitated  and  suicidal  i am  no rights  no problems   how is this okay  how is this the world i live in  how can i possibly want to live  why am i put through all this just for trying to die  ,1
ive been a hypocrite in this sub and im sorry i try to steer others away from suicide and yet  im no different  these thoughts just seem to stay in a state of temporary stasis and randomly decide to manifest themselves whenever they feel like it    theres a hidden urge to simply hit the eject button in the midst of this all  everything and nothing begin to lose their value and meaning altogether  undoing myself would bring upon a much more needed comfort because my comfort doesnt truly seem to lie in this life   conversely  if i want to stay alive  i hesitate  i think it over a lot  it works because i am not dead yet  i think therefore i am alive  ,1
bye r suicidewatch  i m getting  therapy  my mom saw my cuts and now i m gonna get therapy  i got help accidentally  yay i guess  i hope all of you get the help you need  ,1
i just die inside when my parents mention things i will do in the future even though i have no intention on living that far    like when my parents say  when you finish university   when you get a job   when you get a girlfriend   when you re my age    shit hurts cuz i don t plan on living that long   ,1
i have sexual thoughts about kids  im     please dont hate me  i already hate myself more than you ever will  i wasnt always this way   but sometime around       i began to notice that i felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children   they arent urges to hurt them or  god forbid  do  that  to them   but i would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet   that sounds really strange  and this requires some backstory on me  since my teens  ive been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom  dont ask why  who the hell knows    it mostly pertained to people my age   but then i accidentally came across a kid  google image  i dont go to any    sites   good lord  and found myself equally aroused   i was horrified   i know this is really  really gross and sick  i know   its happening more and more often  these thoughts   i had a therapist who knew  but when she moved away  i had no one   trust me  it takes months or even  years  to build up that kind of trust for me   i cant even say the   word   itself because i am so sickened by how i think sometimes   believe me  you cannot hate me more than i hate myself   i nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in march   please  please  just   be kind   thats all i want   ive never felt more alone  ,1
why are people who really want to die not allowed to kill themselves  i got lucky in life   family  friends  passionate hobbies  relatively good looks   even so  i ve felt really fucking bad for ages now  i just want to die every day but i feel like it would be really sudden   hurtful to a lot of people  an aunt of mine told me once that people who commit suicide are selfish   cowardly after i d told her i was suicidal  i think she meant it as a kind of wake up call  but that s not how it came out   whenever i drink a ton  don t get out of bed or don t go to school  my mum also says things like that to me  but jeez  would she rather me be a zombie like this  or just be dead  people who feel this way are suffering  i m really in pain  it s selfish to want to keep me alive for their own emotional benefit without helping  like i don t have feelings   i m just hoping it happens soon  maybe something heavy will fall while i m under a construction site or something  either that or i ll resort to something else    sorry for being a downer ,1
hey suicide watch family  im just checking in    the homeless shelter has been going very nicely  this new city im staying in has many kind donators who keep us fed and clothed     the shelter assigned me a case manager that will help me stay on track and focused toward getting on my feet and helping me get my own apartment    ive met some very interesting people  and they all have been very friendly towards me so far  we all like to hangout and chit chat in this garden and also watch court cases together  p   love love love you guys  ,1
you know your life is an absolute wreck when you casually debate in your head whether you should go to college or commit suicide instead  this is really the state of my life right now  applied  got accepted  and getting ready to finalize everything  college starts in a month and i still havent chosen yet  with each passing day  the latter seems more and more appealing  ,1
just tried  my cat saved me my hairs soaked and i put away the razor  was in the tub cutting myself to end it all  door was closed but my cat got in and meowed at me and wouldnt leave  got out of the tub and in bed cuddling with him  he saved me  but i wish he hadnt  but im safe for now i guess ,1
i wish killing yourself was easy  like just pop one pill  feel no pain  fall asleep and never wake up    i really wish it was that easy  ,1
on the verge of giving up i am being harassed and the legal system is set up to protect the people harassing me more than me  i keep begging the police for help and  they seem sympathetic but tell me that they cant do anything since i am not being threatened  i just lost one of my jobs over this and have no idea what i am going to do  there is no justice in the justice system   i am going broke from legal fees  bills  and unexpected expenses  the job i lost was only part time but that      a month matters  my ex destroyed my credit so i cant even rely on that  my electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and i dont have the money to pay the rest of the bill   i have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and i moved so i didnt get the bill  my cat is epileptic and takes medication  she has to get bloodwork every year and i dont know how i am going to afford both the old bill and the new one  im so fucking useless that i cant even properly take care of my cat   i have a new boyfriend but im having trouble enjoying it  he reached out to play with my hair yesterday and i flinched so obviously that he pulled back  he told me its okay  he understands  and even apologized to me for scaring me   he  apologized to  me  like he did something wrong  im the one thats so broken that i pull away from kindness  he deserves so much better than what i can offer   i am exhausted to the bone  im averaging   hours of sleep a night and its interrupted by nightmares  every noise sends me into a panic and i feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on   my anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere  i cant leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way  i can only go out when i am with someone and i just feel so goddamn pathetic asking people to come with me to the store  the panic attacks are brutal and i find myself hoping one will just give me a heart attack and be done with it   im just so fucking tired of fighting and getting nowhere  every time i think things are getting better  something happens and they get worse  ,1
i would like to dedicate this to the memory of all the people  r suicidewatch and  r depression have lost over the years  many nights  as i am laying in bed  i think about you lot and all those we have lost  i think about the posts i have read on here  of those i have replied to and those who came here to say goodbye  i remember and i wonder  did she walk off into the woods that night to overdose in peace  did he hang himself in his basement  did he jump from the top of those offices and did she walk away into the cold to never be seen again  did these people go through with it or where they persuaded otherwise  did they succeed and did they find the peace and release they wanted   for the most part  we rarely learn your names  we are usually only left to remember your reddit username and even then  this is one of the only things we know about you  i will be honest  i do not actually remember your usernames for i see so many everyday but i do remember you guys  i think about you often and i just hope that you did find the peace you went to seek  i hope that you found what you were looking for  or something better  if you are still with us  i hope you found that epiphany instead  the one so many of us are fortunate enough to have  and i hope you learned what you have to live for   but for those of you who came here to say goodbye  i do respect you all so much  in reading your words  i am pleased to know that you had thought it through and though you were wanting to end the pain  you did it for the happiness that peace would bring   you knew what you were doing and truly wanted it and were not just doing it out of desperation on the instance of of a thought   i just want you guys to know that  though we may not know  or remember  your names  we do think of you often  you are remembered by those that did not know you and truly missed by those who did  you were remembered and all of you always will be  good luck to everyone reading this and to the memories of those who no longer can  see you in another life  brother   this is for those who helped to save others  this is for those who could not be saved  this is for those who may need saving  this is for those who are reading this  this is for those who are not  this is for those who no longer can  this is for you  see you in another life  brother  ,1
 if only they would have reached out    pure bullshit     i see it all over the news in these  mental health campaigns   some celebrity going on about how depressed people just need to talk about it  i can already picture people i know saying after my death   if only he would have reached out    if only he would have talked about it   this is fucking bullshit and they can all fuck right off  i reached out  i tried to talk to so many of you so many times  but you gave me nothing back  nothing  you can only reach out or talk  if people are willing to listen and people are not    i have always been told that i dont smile much  like it was an accusation  no one ever bothered to ask if i was okay  i wish the transition from life to death was a bit easier  its not nice to know my last moments will be filled with instinct driven panic and regret  i just want it all to stop  i need it to stop  im tired  ,1
do you guys ever wish that there was a simple button that would give you instant and painless death when you press it  if there was such a button  i would have pressed it long time ago    ,1
why are im gonna live announcements allowed here  this post is not meant to target anyone in specific  i see this really often in this subreddit  and it just got me so upset  people who come to announce here fuck depression  i have decided to live or im leaving this subreddit because im better now get the most karma and thus  visibility  although here are posts hourly about how someones gonna do it  or needs someone to talk with  who am i to say about who needs more attention  but in my opinion  its the people who are struggling    also  maybe its just me  but these positive posts make me wanna kill myself even more  this makes me sound like a bitter piece of shit  and maybe i am just that  these uplifting posts are probably meant to be motivating and so on  but i just cant see or feel it  so please dont get me wrong  i wish everyone could live without suicidal thoughts  i wish everyone well  i wish no one felt the need to be in this subreddit  its just really  really hard to feel happy for those who just decided to live  when ive been fighting my suicidal thoughts over half of my life  and know its not gonna get better before im finally dead    im sorry if i got anyone upset with this  that wasnt my intention  i wish i could die already  and not be such a whiny nuisance  ,1
existing is exhausting    im so tired of waking up  day in  day out  seeing the sun doesnt make feel grateful or energized for the next  bright new day   it doesnt make me think of fresh starts and  every moment is a chance to turn it all around      everytime i see the sun  i just feel my whole being shrink away  its too bright and somehow makes an already overstimulating world  louder and faster   like a sick animal  i just want to find a quiet hole to crawl away into and die  isolated from everything and everyone around me     i only exist for my sisters sake but theres no way to exist for myself as well  i am a worthless  useless and pathetic excuse for a    year old human being with nothing to offer anyone    im so tired of being alive  i just want the noise in my head to stop  ,1
why cant there be an easy and peaceful way to die  ive wanted to kill myself for a while now  but im afraid of suffering or being in a panicked situation even if its only for the brief moment  why are the only options inhumane methods  its so stupid that society is against assisted suicide  especially because whats the harm with it  some might say its unethical  well its also unethical to force someone to kill themselves inhumanely    i hate this   ,1
    feeling unappreciated   like people won t accept me for who i am   that i m uninteresting and a burden   i m tired of acting happy  i m tired of living  i want to leave    but fear stops me   i don t want to hurt my family  i don t get treated well  emotions hold me back   nothing excites me  my future ambitions are gone  i love sleeping because it s the closest thing to death    i ve started working out  eating healthier  a lot of things i want are given to me  i m thankful for all of it  but that won t save me   i just want love  from anyone   a family member  perhaps a friend or stranger   but i feel that even if i find love it won t be enough  when will i ever be satisfied  i guess i m stuck here until natural events are the end of me    ,1
listening to music while drunk is amazing hopefully i won t wake up tomorrow ,1
does anybody actually wake up every day thinking  wow i cant wait for another one   its just day after day of agony  i cant comprehend that people actually enjoy it  ,1
my experience with  reaching out   ppl   people need to reach out when they re feeling suicidal  there s help available out there  you matter    me   reaches out   ppl   omg you re just looking for attention lol stop being so overdramatic   ,1
the suicide hotline saved my life last night i was very nervous about calling but i dont regret it at all  amazing resource ,1
we euthanize pets when we think they have no more quality of life left and it s deemed the  responsible  thing to do  but when a human knows their life and that they have no hope left  suddenly everyone becomes the expert on  suicide is selfish and there s a chance things will get better  i don t want to live out the next       years of my natural lifespan in pain waiting for the day to come so i just want to take matters into my own hands now and save myself the suffering  i don t need judged and told to hold on because things  might  improve  my life has had    years in it  plenty of time to live it and know it s never going to get any better  if things were ever going to get better and my life was going to improve then it would ve happened by now ,1
my girlfriend committed suicide  and im worried ill end up doing the same my girlfriend of over   years committed suicide a few days ago  and i feel like im fucking dying inside  on one hand  i feel so much emotional pain that its killing me  but on the other hand  i also feel so numb and empty and lost  i cant process it   i wanted to propose to her  the worst part is that the reason she did it was because she was being sexually abused by a  friend  of mine for years  but kept it a secret from everyone because she was being blackmailed by him    i feel like its my fault  i should have realised  i should have stopped it from happening  i cant believe i let that piece of shit anywhere near her  i feel so much guilt that its driving me crazy   my head is a mess  i havent left the house for days  i havent spoken to anyone  ive been ignoring all the phone calls and text messages from my family and friends because i cant bear talking about it because i dont want to acknowledge that its reality  i havent opened the door to anyone whos tried to come and visit me   i cant sleep properly  ive practically been starving myself  i just keep thinking that i wanna die  in the shower  i wanna drown  in the kitchen  i wanna take a knife and just end it  i cant take this feeling  i just want her back  i love her so much  and i dont know what im going to do without her   i hate everything right now  and that evil fucking son of a bitch is probably gonna get off free and not even gonna go to prison because i dont have any good evidence    everythings just a mess  and i feel like im not fully in control of my own actions at the moment  i dont want my family to find me dead  but i feel like its whats gonna end up happening if i cant get my shit together  sorry for the long post  ,1
it s just sad because the only thing i see in my future is eventually killing myself  i am just imagining doing it now  it sounds so nice  peaceful  i just want things to be quiet  somewhere beautiful     i won t kill myself today  and not tomorrow  i know that killing myself means hurting my family  i ve seen how suicides affect people     but i m in so much pain  i m   days clean from cutting  the mental and physical pain are so much sometimes   anytime i m feeling something other than sadness or depression i know it will fade  i feel like i see the world for what it is when i m depressed  i m more creative when i can think    idk i m just kind of ranting  you guys don t need to send me to someone to talk  i m okay  today s my first day of being on a new antidepressant so eventually i will get better  i am seeing a psychologist though i think i need to talk more often to them  ,1
must feel amazing to not want to kill yourself at least   times a day  i dont even remember what a normal life feels like after starting this beautiful depressive journey in october       some of you are so unbelievably strong that you are still here after eternities of pain     x   b   also blows my mind that there are people out there who dont want to kill themselves at least   times a day      x   b     x   b   rough life  eh   ,1
on having no friends in your   s the schedule is always the same  you work    hours each week and work out    more  you eat takeout at your desk  you stare   blankly   at others from whom you feel depersonalized and disassociated  they stare back  they glare back  they retch and recoil  you go home and eat more takeout and stare some more   at the wall  at the ceiling  out the window  you watch the world turn  you regret  you speak to yourself and diagnose yourself and add and subtract and divide and grind your teeth and lament and   nothing changes  you stare down and seek reprieve in the rug  you hug your knees and smoke a hundred cigarettes  you exercise again and read a little  you return to work and lie about your weekend plans and your mental health  you hope and dash those hopes  you wait and pray  you shower too long  you eat too little  you never sleep   you resolve  you plot  you choose the tools  you cradle them and know you can end it in minutes  you cower and retreat  and it comes in waves and you attempt again but flee again too  you cannot tell anyone  you cannot hug anyone  there s no one to hug   your parents and grandparents age  they inquire ceaselessly after your condition  you lie again  you say things are fine  the social life survives  you enjoy work  you enjoy nothing  you drink  you smoke  you masturbate  you cry some more   nothing changes  spring fills fragrant the air and summer brings its heavy trod  the autumn wind bites and the weeks stretch on  the days grow longer then shorter again  the walk is the same  the work is the same  the nights are the same  the sun and moon and stars and horizon are the same  you are the same   nothing changes  ,1
stop trying to fucking guilt trip me   your family will be so distraught if you hurt yourself         you have no idea how much of an impact suicide will have on those around you       imagine the reaction of your parents  imagine them reading the note  receiving the call              wtf     i know you have good intentions but  please   is this really supposed to make me feel better    all it does is fill me with guilt    and fills me with the realization that i have to live in fucking pain until the day i die    or until everyone who  cares about me  will die  ,1
i understand suicide im starting to understand people who commit suicide  its like  when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just cant imagine living it every day  year after year  you have people tell you it gets better but its been years and it hasnt so it probably wont and youre tired   so tired  you just dont want to fight through the day anymore  i think when you commit suicide its with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once youre gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it  suicide is indeed selfish but  perhaps for some  they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first  always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were   how they were managing   if they were ok  maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldnt take it anymore  for some  life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest   they enjoy it and love it   but for others   its so long   never ending   painful  being alive and living are two different things  maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking  they couldnt give a minute to realize  death is funny like that  its not always on a physical level    i have struggled with my depression the majority of my life  while those i care about thought ive gotten better  the reality is  ive just gotten better at hiding it  there are nights that i lie awake dreading waking up  living the day that just ended again  over and over  its a cycle that never ends   nothing ever changes  nothing good is sustained  life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today  every bad decision plagues me and losses ive suffered haunt my thoughts  on the rare occasion i attempt to reach out  i know i will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand  there is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line    night before last  while lying awake  i realized i understood people who committed suicide  that scared me  i am in a dark place and i have never felt more alone in my life  this is a time where i could have used the most support  at this time i no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships  its taking so much effort and i need to put everything i have left into my children  they have to be my primary focus and im just not sure i have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter sister etc  ,1
i never had anyone to support me or genuinely care about me  i turned    and i ve realized how pathetic my life is  i graduate soon  and i plan on going away forever    the thought of that is my only relief right now   ,1
so the suicide hotline just hung up on me  twice  i have no one  having a breakdown  called them for the first time ever  apparently i wasnt suicidal enough  fuck me  right  ,1
i want to kill myself so i don t have to work  i have a hard time keeping jobs   hello  past a year or two i been having a hard time keeping a job  i just ether don t like the job  the people there  i feel like i m always doing something wrong  i hate waking up and wasting my whole day there   i don t care about money like really i rather live on the streets or just be dead but my parents keep telling me the same stuff over and over  saying how  everyone hates working  or  what do you expect to do in life  just sit in our house forever doing nothing  or  that s life for you  man up stop acting like a kid your a adult now    i have a job right now  but honestly i just want to quit  i managed to keep this job for   months but i don t know what i m gonna do all i think about is i m going have to work everyday of my life and i have a hard time making it thru one day   a day feels like for ever  idk everyday it feels like its my last day  i just hate living since i can t function like a normal person for some reason it seems like everyone is able to do everything better then me and i m just a mistake   i m on antidepressants they helped me to get the job i mentioned and probably why i stayed so long but there not helping much i think my depression got worst but idk    so for rambling i m just so lost right now in life   i m    btw ,1
it is hard having no friends everyday i wake up to remember the crushing fact that i have no friends and will forever be alone  my social anxiety prevents me from getting friends or a girlfriend and it fucking sucks  ,1
suicide hotline hung up on me i told them everything that was happening and that i dont want to go on and they said sorry we couldnt help you and disconnected  are you fucking kidding me  like i was placing an order at taco bell  i feel like they answered my problem right there  its a good thing i dont have my pistol  fuckin hell  how can you claim to help anyone suicidal with resources that cant help people  now i want to run headfirst into traffic   ,1
this sandwich doesnt taste good  it doesnt  bizarre as it is  this sandwich just doesnt taste good  it doesnt really taste like anything at all  it should  though  its got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo  well  miracle whip actually  im a heathen of sandwiches   tons of flavor  i used to love this sandwich  and id eat it while doing things i loved to do  it was my gaming sandwich  my movie watching sandwich  my writing sandwich  my singing sandwich  i think the only thing i never used this sandwich for was foreplay  mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood      probably should post this on my throwaway account but   meh       i guess its not just the sandwich  on my other monitor  im rewatching dragonball z for the umpteenth time  majin buu is paused  looking like an idiot  i love dragonball z  watching it is supposed to make me happy  same with everything else ive tried watching for the past two days   west wing  pacific rim  jurassic park  freakazoid  temporary distractions  which is good  but ultimately they just arent giving me any pleasure anymore  nothing is      im so exhausted  ive been exhausted for weeks  but sleeping is terrible  all i do is lie there and think about people ive hurt  friends ive lost due to ways ive treated them  there is no atonement when they dont even speak to you anymore  i catch glimpses of them    accidental snapchat stories and things like that  i look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so i can hear them talk to me again  its a common fallacy in the world that somehow  taking responsibility  for your actions makes everything okay  i almost wish i was ignorant to my own wrongdoings    right now  im just furious and guilty and theres nothing i can do about it  so i lie there  listening to white noise or comforting asmr videos to try and keep my brain at bay  usually though  ill end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death  who will get contacted first  based on which methods and which scenarios  how will certain outliers in my social circle find out  who will be mad  who will be devastated      i never intended on posting to this subreddit  ive lurked here many times when i was feeling suicidal  and im not exactly sure why  reading about other peoples suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better  and typically  id actually feel worse for being in my mental state when id read other peoples stories  stories of abuse  abandonment  mistreatment  the worst the world has to dish out  thats what would send people to this dark place in their dark times  me  im just   weak  i guess      ive been fighting off my own death since i was    ish  ive attempted suicide a handful of times already  i was a cutter as a teenager  then i moved to more drastic attempts  had to be talked down from an overpass once  my most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my klonopin prescription  march       that was the closest ive gotten to death  right after i did it  i called my mom  i wanted to die but   i was still scared  i was sobbing on the phone  when she realized what id done  she got the paramedics to my apartment  by the time they arrived  they had to break in my door  id lost motor function  i vaguely remember the phone call  and i vaguely remember waking up in the hospital      anyway  this sandwich doesnt taste good  life has lost its flavor  and im exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year      in november       my life broke down  hard  i had been living on my own  in vegas  i had a great job with a great company  making decent money  it was stressful  hell yeah  and in a micro view i was unhappy  but if i looked at things in a macro sense  i was doing great  i had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time i was working bananas hours  i was hopefully working towards a new promotion  i had goals  i was really trying  i was seeing my primary physician  my psych  and a weekly therapist  everybody was on board with my mental health  i was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working  my therapist and i were several months into the process and i felt comfortable talking to her  i was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out      so  then it all just went poof  i broke down  stopped going to work  stopped talking to anyone  just  abruptly  one day  didnt show up  didnt call  my brain led a savage counterattack  like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness  i hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state  posting nonsense to facebook  eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home  i returned  but nothing changed  i lost my dog  gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than i could  i went to be with my parents in ohio to try and sort myself out  stayed there for about a month  visited family  tried to re center myself  same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to vegas in january      got back to vegas  walked into my apartment and i realized    absolutely nothing had changed  i was still jobless  and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment  and thats not to paint them in a bad light    not at all  im saying  these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored  calling  texting  trying to reach me  and id blown them off  their frustration with me was out of a place of self preservation  you cant help someone who wont help themselves      and thats exactly what happened  all through january  i stayed holed up in my apartment  i burned through most of my savings  just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night  i neglected my bills  i didnt care  at all  i let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when i was evicted and had to live  and eventually die  homeless and alone  it was fine by me  i just   i felt like i had been switched off  whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and i was just drifting along the current until i washed up on some metaphorical beach and died      lots of other weird stuff happened during that period  i insulted people  i hurt people  i did things i regret  i think i may have caused that close friends cat to die  i had some sort of other person or personality  take the wheel  for a few days  its all kind of a blur      but eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave  eventually she got me to open the door  and basically forcibly dragged me out  she took me hiking  i saw sunlight for the first time in a long time  i had real face to face conversation and then we had lunch  something other than chinese or dominos delivery  we got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up  dozens of garbage bags  filled with old boxes and rotted food  and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that id still been holding onto out of denial  we wiped down counters and started laundry  vacuumed and straightened  she took me to the grocery  bought me real food with actual nutrients  she did a one woman barn raising      she left  and the message was clear    you have people who love you  but you have to help us help you        i didnt      in no time at all  i was just as withdrawn as before  even being slapped in the face by compassion wasnt enough to kick start my desire to live  to fight  to survive       my father showed up one day  i let him in  we started packing my belongings  the movers showed up  we sold my truck  i tried to hold my head high as i said goodbye to my friends one last time       well see you in a few months dude        its just a temporary thing  you just need some time to figure yourself out       i knew it was lies  i knew even then  i wouldnt see these people again  i really did love them all  theyd been my friends for years and years and years  through times very similar to this one  but i knew this was different  it felt different  because it didnt feel at all      i drove back to ohio with my dad  and i did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him  my mind was swimming and i really didnt remotely care about taking a road trip  but i knew he was excited so i tried to fake it for him  when we finally got to the house  i hugged my mom  she was so happy to see me  so relieved  its got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you cant help  i took my suitcase upstairs  and sat on my childhood bed      and i sobbed  i sobbed tears that hadnt wanted to come out for months  this was supposed to be a way for me to start over  but i knew deep in my core that it was the end  i looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth  and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that i was already dead      that was early march  here we are  nearing the middle of july  i still tried  to be honest  i tried  despite having no desire to do so  i tried to find solace in my family and i tried to rekindle my love for music  i joined a band  i started posting my own solo projects online  the band thinks im great  and the solo stuff ive posted to  r makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far      and none of that matters      ive never thought to myself  the world would be a better place without me   no  im fully aware that i bring joy and light into peoples lives  im funny  im talented  im smart  im not half bad looking  either  when i take care of myself  honest  i know all of that  i just   i dont   care    im so exhausted  im so done  its going to be in the next day or so  there are train tracks not too far from my house   im just going to park nearby  and start walking along until i can hitch a face first ride to the afterlife  i cant fight anymore  i cant keep living life where i cry so often  and feel so empty and so guilty  i cant just sit here in my parents house with no job and no purpose  im exhausted  im all out of fight      this sandwich doesnt taste good  ,1

holy shit dude i remember thinking how bizarre the idea of suicide was back when i was a kid and now im here longing it more than ever    for me being suicidal feels too normal now if im not suicidal i find ways to make myself fall back again this is plain awful ,1
i just tried to call a couple of suicide prevention hotlines and they were so busy that i was placed on hold  or asked to leave a message for a call back   i have been seriously planning to kill myself today   i have enough sedatives for a lethal dose  and i ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot  but i ve been fighting the urge all day and i finally tried to call someone   the fact that the lines were so busy made me realise i m not alone   there must be countless people trying to call my country s helplines and somehow it s oddly comforting to know that the reason i can t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge   i ll keep trying to get through because i need someone to tell me i have a reason to keep living  but i just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation    it s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket  there may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out  whilst i am just very close to acting  who am i to take their place in the queue   i guess it s just strangely helpful to know that there are so many people feeling the same way i do   love and well wishes to anyone reading this    ,1

valentines day  the perfect day for me to kill myself ive been stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety depression loneliness for over   years now  for the past   years ive had pretty much daily suicidal thought  i wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day im gonna hang myself   im    and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way  i have zero confidence  i havent achieved anything in my life  dropped out of college  anxiety makes me stress freak out about thing other people do like its nothing  even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure i am  got a horrible relationship with my parents  i dont enjoy anything anymore  every aspect of the future frightens me  losing touch with my only few friends  been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when i was about    ive never even kissed a girl and now its too late for me  im hopeless cause im too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone  im skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will   love only gives me negative feelings  it makes me anxious  panicky  makes me realize im not good enough  all the stuff i havent done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore  for the past months  despite trying to surpress it  ive been falling in love with the only female colleague i have a pretty good connection with but shes rediculously far out of my league  quit a lot older and will leave soon so its another heartbreak either way  better end it before yet another all time low  i have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal  so hopefully       will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance   thanks for your interest ive youve been reading untill this point  ,1

my boyfriend killed himself a week ago and i really want to do the same  it hurts so much to miss him every second of every day  we were a good couple  with so much love for each other  we were each other s everything  whenever i had anxiety or was simply sad  the only thing that helped was his hugs and kisses  now he s not here anymore  he s just ashes   my friends got worried about me and got me committed against my will at a short term mental hospital and i just got out today     days after his death   i miss him with every fibre and molecule and atom of my being  it s physically painful  insufferable  i can t think about anything else   i tried overdosing on xanax with alcohol but i didn t have enough  and when i woke up the next day i was so disappointed  this was before the hospitalisation  during the hospitalisation i was ok  better than now  but i don t want to go back there  the place was awful   the only reason i m not attempting a new od this very second is that it would kill  figuratively  my parents  everyone would be sad  and i can t do that to them  but at the same time  my love is never coming back and he s all i want  all i need  need with every cell in my body  it physically hurts   i wish i could disappear from their memories and just die and nobody would be sad  because i can t take it anymore  the grief is too big  too hard  what can i do to make it okay for everyone  ,1
anyone else get super depressed around the holidays and just want to say fuck it and end things  feeling that way now  i suffer from depression  clearly  however  this holiday season i have been feeling it extra hard  and i dont know why  i have tried to do everything i can to cheer myself up  ive gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones  even wrapping them nicely  not an easy feat for a klutz like me   was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews  tried dressing a lot nicer at work  figured fake it until i make it  its worked in the past  but last night i found myself driving to my local gun store  about    minutes from me  and looking at guns to buy  i used to have a decent sized collection   cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations  then over time i would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck  i dont have any more  i bought a kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldnt do it  just ending up cutting a little  however  last night i found myself wanting to buy a gun  however  with me as someone who likes guns i want the gun to have meaning  isnt that fucked up  like almost anyone will do  but i wanted something specific  found one that was almost exactly what i wanted and priorly owned  but didnt end up purchasing it  instead i drove around for a bit and just meditated  although i am debating going back there today  getting that gun  driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car      i hate hurting people  i have seen what suicide has done to people  my best friend killed himself while drunk almost   years ago  it tore everything apart  my girlfriends brother killed himself shortly before thanksgiving and it has torn her apart  i have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down  i also fear what does or doesnt come next  i most likely wont do shit  as i am a coward and i care too much  but damn do i want to just end my suffering    ,1
does anyone else find that the fear of what s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed  i just feel like that survival instinct that kicks in just makes everything ten times worse  and people who say well that s a sign that you shouldn t do it don t get how that isn t it at all  i m already not human i ve already lost my mind i have nothing left  like it just feels like torture  ,1
i didnt ask to be born  but im here and im forced to function and work on a world that i objectively hate  what do i do about this  obviously  nobody asks to be born into this world  i certainly didnt  but here i am at    years old  simply put  i objectively dislike the world and society  i didnt ask to have to need participate in society and  to work in order to pay for food  shelter  etc   but of course most people will just say im lazy for not wanting to work  can they really just not wrap their heads around that concept  how can i get over this involuntary existence without deep downbeing miserable every second of my life until i die  again  i did not ask to be a part of this  but since im here i have no choice other than to work and he miserable until i die  i feel so stuck and i also feel that ive never actually heard a real answer to these feelings other than  well duh nobody asks to be born just get over it   what the fuck do i do with that  ,1

i need help    but i dont know what kind  i m just putting this out there because reddit seems to be the only place i can talk freely           i am so lost i don t even know how to explain it           when i lost the only guy i had ever loved some six years ago  it really ripped my soul out  i never recovered from that  all the ambition  the positive thinking  the effort and the goals in my life just vanished       i kept on going through the motions for a while  but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum  just enough to stay afloat  for a while i could live off that       but then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself  and the bare minimum became a struggle       it s not that i couldn t do more   i was  and am  capable  it s just not in me  i have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning  i fear waking up  and cry every morning when i do      i am not pining for some guy anymore  i don t even have the motivation to do that   it s like i m completely empty  i just don t feel anything except this big heavy stone  it s like everything that i was full of drained out of me  and there s nothing left      i have  technically  a boyfriend  but he s worthless   there s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label  when i try to tell him how hopeless i feel  if i dare use the word  depressed   then there s hell to pay  a locker room pep talk that starts with  you re a worthless piece of shit  do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever  fight   and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house  eventually he calms down and apologises but then it s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam  nothing ever changes  nothing gets better       and everything just keeps getting worse           now  i can t make this month s rent            i was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour  dreading going back home  not because of a boyfriend i am so indifferent to that i can t bother to dump him  not because of a rent that s only a few hundred dollars low  not because of a dying industry that i might as well just change  but because of the thought that even if i do go home  even if i do go to sleep and wake up in the morning  it will be just as bad as it was yesterday  and will only get worse           i have been contemplating suicide for more than three years  but last night was the worst for a long time  i have researched it thoroughly  but can t find a feasible  painless  quick solution  the pain terrifies me   the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation  guns aren t available in this country  i have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death  perhaps the best option i have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run   i heard you just go to sleep           but i know that i didn t jump on the tracks last night  and i haven t taped up my car windows just yet  and for some reason i am here typing this long  long note out  so something in me   soul or no soul   doesn t want to give up just yet  i don t know what to do               i think that when i wake up tomorrow morning  if i dont feel any better  i will just go ahead and jump  the station is only a five minute walk through the park  it only gets worse from here  anyways                             edit    when i woke up this morning  the first thing i did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice  and i burst into tears  seriously  i have never felt so protected  so warm  and so safe in any community as i do here  i found people to talk to  people who understand  people who sympathize  people who listen  people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any i have felt in years  there are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief i feel  its like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out               since im not really sure what to think and how to react  it has helped so much to read your messages  i will prepare something  some kind of  ongaeshi   i will post it up soon             once again          thank you for caring about me  ,1
 if you feel suicidal  call the suicide hotline or      i can t deal with constantly hearing and seeing this  once  a long time ago  i called the suicide hotline and then they sent a ton of police to my house  now i can t drive for fear of getting pulled over by the police and getting triggered  i hate hearing it all the time  it s just a lie  they aren t going to help me  they re going to send police to my house who will take me to a hospital and lock me in and then send me a bill that i can t afford  i wish i could actually talk to the suicide hotline people without a legitimate fear of being locked up in inpatient  ,1

fuck girlfriends i just want a friend people always talk on here about being lonely and wanting a girlfriend but i honestly couldnt care less  i just want a friend  a single one  when you think about it  love is kind of selfish    the idea of wanting one person all to yourself  forever  is kind of psychotic  with friends however you can maintain a healthy distance but still enjoy each others company and also genuinely care about them    anyone else feel the same way  ,1

my sisters suicide this week  i ve never posted here before  but i thought i d share my story due to events that happened this week  i am sophia s younger brother  i have two older sisters  as well   and i am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at  this is her reddit account which she made this month    https   www reddit com user humanzucchini  https   www reddit com user humanzucchini    i was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since i last met her in september       and it s unfortunate that i was not given the chance to contact her  as i have autism and depression too  i had no idea that she tried to run away before i contacted her on her birthday this month  she actually responded  thank you  love you always    just two weeks ago from today     x   b   we had our fights and arguments in the past  but we sincerely amended this last year  and we enjoyed our older sister s wedding together  when we went abroad in august        i genuinely believed she would come home for the easter holidays in a few weeks  as i accepted that she didn t want to come home for christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies  this tragedy has brought the family closer together  i had a heart to heart with my father  who i thought didn t understand my emotions or cared enough about them  i vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family  i promised that if i ever felt like this  i would get in touch immediately  i contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again  i have been taken aback by all the supportive comments i received  even from people i never really spoke to that i assumed didn t care for me     x   b   she was proud of me  because  last year  on the drive back home from the airport  she told me i had overcome so much  in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since       i don t want the same fate as her  because i feel responsible for this world  regardless of how much evil is committed every day  and i want to change it for the better in my life  aside from the times that we fell out  i tried to socialise with her  as she usually locked herself in her room and played music  i gave her documents that she requested me to print out  i asked if she wanted to play smash bros   i tried to teach her how to play  and i remember the time that i had a      handicap and still won   i asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me  steven universe  invader zim  star vs  the forces of evil  etc    i respected her decision to focus on her studies  i would have done the same   and i thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer  after finishing her undergraduate degree     x   b   whenever the funeral service is planned  i intend to sing  love like you   the credits theme from steven universe   in front of all the attendees  she couldn t get into the show from watching the first five episodes  she thought it was too goofy   but she liked the songs from the show  even from episodes she hadn t seen before  i remember she was listening to  stronger than you  and  dear old dad  whilst studying at home  thank you for all the memories  and i won t let you down     x   b   i posted this here  as she posted on this subreddit this month  and i want to help and talk to people who feel this way  because i have felt like this before  i also posted this on suicide bereavement   ,1

dont take the pills    it hurts so i dont think this will stop people from ending their but maybe it will make someone rethink it  today i tried to overdosed on     mg of antidepressants  at about     pm i took ten pills and waited   now obviously  i didnt die  but it feels like i am  after about an hour i got dozy  had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff  i wasnt scared  i wasnt sad i was just so groggy  ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache   for half an hour i threw up stomach acid violently  i felt like i was going to pass out  so i went to my room to lay down  hell i shouldve gone to a hospital  the dizziness got worse and i was gagging constantly  i couldnt lay down without hurting  i couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question  even now  almost four hours later my body is in small spasms and im having a hard time just typing because my body is shaking uncontrollably   my head still hurts and i cant focus on much  im exhausted and i cant sleep  this isnt fun  i wish that i didnt do this honestly  i wish i didnt try like this  so if you read this and youre thinking of ending your life with pills  just give it a second thought because its not a painless death  ,1

ive finally hit my limit ive been steadily getting worse over the past six months  no amount of medication seems to be helping  and i cant for the life of me seem to be able to get into counselling   finally got some respite in a small holiday for a wedding  and when it came to it i freaked out and missed the entire ceremony  set of the alarm to the villa and ruined everything  the reception is happening as i type this   now im just in bed absolutely dreading having to face everyone again  ive no handle on my anxiety and ive no idea where to even begin    im sick of fucking up absolutely everything  i cant do this anymore    i feel so ridiculous for being set off by this one little thing  but ive hit my limit  i plan on killing myself the night we get the plane back home  eeeh  thanks for letting me rant i guess  see you on the other side ,1

cops and medics broke in my apartment i have been suicidal for a long time now  but lately its getting worse  so i was just chilling at home like i usually do  it was just those days where u want to be alone and dont want to have anything to do with this world  so i turned my phone off and was just doing my thing  well after   days i was playing some games on steam when i suddenly hear some noise  i threw my headphones off and the next thing i know i have cops and rescue workers standing behind me  it was a shock for sure  i didnt know what to do  i didnt really tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts execpt for one friend who i dont hang with anymore  well instead of admiting i need help i lied to medics that im doing good and need no help  it was hard  it was one of those days where suicide was on my  mind       but its to hard for me to open up  i feel like i dont deserve help i just want to be left alone forgotten  turns out my friends called for help  i didnt even know they cared about me   this shit suprised me they care about me  about me  i was crying after for like an hour about this i didnt even realize someone actually cares  but i think i knew this deep inside anyway  but my life isnt going to be better in any way  still deep in debt  might get evicted in a few days  same problems still exist  i wanted to kill myself for a long time  i had it planned ahead in like   months  i just feel bad for people who care about and  i will let them down for a final time  i will kill myself in few months for my birthday  but now i feel even more guilty for hurting people around me  but i cant live like this i dont want to  this world just isnt for me  i dont fit in  i cant anymore just cant  i feel like now its even harder after what i saw yesterday  people crying worried about me    nobody really knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts except for one friend who i was really close to before we went seperate ways  it was fcking hard on me man i was so fucked up i had to lie to my family  my friends that im good  and had no intention of killing myself  lying to someone u really care about and looking them in they eyes it hurt my soul deep down  i had to hold it together i just wanted to fcking let it all out and cry and admit that im not doing good at all  and now its even harder for me  situation its the same but harder  i will be gone soon but the pain i will bring with my actions i dont even know how to handle that  after all that happened that day i just cried in my bathroom on the floor all night  it was one of the worst nights i had in my life  knowing i just lied to everyone about my well being and at the same time wanting to have someone hold me and tell me its gonna be alright  but well they cant fix me nobody can  ,1

dads friends raped me  i feel paralyzed  i barely had enough energy to open up the computer  i don t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light  i d been in the shower for almost an hour and i just can t get it out  it s crippling me and i m helpless  i have no one else to tell this and i just want to kill myself  i just want the pain to end   i feel so much hate and anger but i can t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them  even you dad  i hate you so much for letting them do this to me  i hate you so much for doing absolutely  nothing  while they raped me  is that what friends do dad   getting you drunk and raping your daughter  none of this would ve happened if mom was still here  she would ve stopped them  it hurt so much i thought they were going to kill me  now i wish they had   you changed a lot after her death  you stopped asking how my day was  you stopped coming to pick me up from school  all my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but i only wanted to see you as soon as school was over  that s how much i love you  do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you d do for me  you only had to show a little of it dad  you only had to stay sober  you only had to remember that i m always here for you  but no  you chose the bottle over me  and i didn t mind cleaning up after you  i didn t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell  it s the demons you brought in with you  you let them take control of you  you let them hurt me  but i still love you dad  i always will  maybe when i m gone i could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to    i needed to tell all of this to you dad  i needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but i don t have the courage and you don t have your mind  i hope it s not you who finds me  sweet dreams dad  remember me and please forgive me  ,1
this world is literally just as bad or worse as my depression makes it out to be  you have to be out of touch with reality to deny whats going on  people say that those with depression see the world with pessimism  but life sucks for everyone  i have no hope for the future  people die all the time in awful ways  its hard to get out of poverty  its hard to live with mental health issues  it just seems so much more ethical to stop all of this madness and leave  i want to peace out of this whole thing  im going insane being here and it just gets worse all the time  ,1
i feel lost from trying to help people on suicidewatch i ended up being one of the ones that need help  how ironic  am i right  it just feels so unfair   i  a person that never did anything right and never really clinged to life  gets to live while many  many good people have to die  i dont like it  thats unfair  i wish i could offer each of them a year of my existence  i want to see them enjoy the warm sunlight on their skin  pet a dog again  eat some ice cream  meanwhile i am here  feeling like my heart is being torn apart  like my body is always cold and frail and unable to cry even though i know i need to  i feel so lost and lonely  i keep thinking about suicide and how many people i would disappoint by doing that   i just want to feel alive or offer my life to who really needs it  ,1
your kids mental state is more important than their grades  im fucking tired of adults only fucking worrying about grades its fucking stupid   ex  my parents know im suicidal  only worry about grades  i dont fucking care about grades if im planning on killing myself and i dont think yall do either  and it just makes it worse for you to say you working on you grades  all the time when im clearly fucking looking like i am wanting to die  but no   to them thats not fucking important  ,1
kinda wish i could just restart as a different person theres no extremely traumatic event that happened in my life  just unhealthy people propagating and creating more unhealthy people like me  i dont want to die  but i dont want to live this particular life either ,1

im the worst doctor in the whole world i cant do anything right  academically i faceplanted my way through school  socially i cant even get a girl to hold my hand  even michael rotondo that    year old basement dweller guy had a exwife and son   if nothing else medical school gave me the necessary information on how to go out peacefully  was it worth           i dont know but luckily after this evening i wont have to ponder it anymore   if someone finds this from my browsing history  im sorry to mom and dad and  i   first name initial  you know who you are   if it helps  i was going to kill myself earlier but wanted to wait till graduation so at least you can know your son accomplished something in life  please use that to comfort you in the dark times ahead  im in a better place now  ,1
i wish i could take someone s cancer away who wants to live and give them my healthy body   ,1
the fact that im shy is the main reason why im suicidal i wish i could say hi to someone without thinking about it    minutes beforehand  i wish i could ask someone a basic question without nearly breaking down  i wish i didnt have to rely on other people approaching me first  so i could make friends by myself  i wish i was confident enough to approach girls without my brain sabotaging me constantly  i wish i could be confident enough to believe that a girl will someday love me  i wish i could walk in public without believing that everyone is judging me and without my heart going absolutely crazy  i wish i could go to the gym  but i always pussy out because i believe everyone there will make fun of me and try to beat me up  i just wish i could be a normal human being ,1

i was wrong i hate when people say to think of how much pain youll cause others  theyll get over it  i always think  im just a burden anyway  theyll be sad for awhile  but better off in the long run   yesterday i intended to kill myself  my ex roommate  its complicated  caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me  when my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me  she was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong  but i could feel her whole body shaking   she sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular  just talked  joked  and laughed like we do  but even half an hour later i could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine  she was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me  but inside she was a wreck  later  when i went up to our room to sleep  she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow  it was such a small gesture  but it  made me feel loved   i knew she would be sad  but i still underestimated how much she cared  i dont know if ill ever forget that feeling  i dont think i should   i wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like i do  i was wrong  you might be too  there are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when i thought they did  theres at least one who cares a whole lot more than i gave her credit for   ,1

i wish life had checkpoints or a reset button      has been absolutely horrible for me  i feel like ive ruined every connection to people i had  it feels like everyone hates me  i have a severe lack of trust in people that over and over again gets proven justified  i barely sleep at all or i sleep too much  i cry every day multiple times but most of the time its for no reason at all or its because my life is just so sad  i can barely function at work  ive been struggling with food for the last few months where i cant seem to eat normally  its either eat way too much or i go at least a day without eating  i keep planning to do things like go for a walk or go see a movie by myself but i fail every time   i wish it would just stop but i feel like i have absolutely no control over what happens in my life and theres no way to change it   ,1
i wish it wasn t painful to kill yourself  ,1
i want to die so bad i want to die so bad  im tired of being alone  im tired of feeling worthless  self loathing  im just tired  im tired of people taking me for granted  im tired of watching people fuck up after i put in effort to help them  i feel so undervalued  i hate myself   i want to kill myself    ,1
why are people acting like its always irrational when somebody wants to die  i have no friends  no social  or any  skills  no job or any normal basic experiences  i dont fit in anywhere and i cant function in society  it makes sense in my situation that i want to die  i believe almost everyone would feel the same if they eyperienced the same things  i dont feel human anymore  objectively it would be better if i didnt exist  i just keep suffering and its exhausting and tiring  ,1

my mom just called me to inform me that my sister was found dead   hours ago hanging from her closet  fuck it all  im done  listen  ive tried  very hard  for years   it doesnt get better  if anything it gets worse and worse   the universe has decided to screw me over yet again  my sister is dead  my beloved little sister  the one that came to me every time she had problems  the one that i had to go visit in the hospital every few months every time she attempted to kill herself  and now shes gone   and im fucking pregnant   life cant possibly get any worse  but im not willing to stick around just to prove it   this will be my last message  im sorry mom that you had to suffer this much  i though i could stick around for you   but you will learn to live  you are strong  you are loved    ill always be with you    thank you everyone for the amazing support  this time is the last  ignore this post and go respond to people who still have a chance  tying my knot right now   okay im inside  its kinda hard but i think i did it right   if i did  goodbye  ,1
why is suicide looked down upon but mental health is often overlooked during the entire buildup  whats the point of going on when you lost everything  no family anymore  no gf anymore  no joy in life anymore  no pursuit of knowledge  due to depression confiding you to a bed  no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi weekly while executives earn       x your salary for your menial work   i read that alan turing  who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during world war    was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay  his hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life  his thirst for knowledge  and eventually made him take his own life  was he weak  no  but defeated  chemically and without purpose   were told suicide is selfish  but if it is so selfish  why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone  where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support   nobody wants to hear your problems  if you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while  lifes short  you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck  people will always remember your wins  but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized  then you ask yourself am i doing enough  is it worth bringing up  or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made  ,1
im so sick of this  find a job you love  bullshit theres not a single job i can think of that doesnt sound like      misery  i dont even want to be alive  yet im forced not only to be here  but to pay for it ,1
i feel like the struggles of young adults and teens on this sub arent treated as seriously because they are young  ive seen many people here see someones age being under    or so and just downplay their feelings because  they have a lot of time to fix it   i see it especially with teens  many people simply say to  give it time  your angsty  your horomones are raging  etc     and i wont deny that certainly plays a part in it  however  i think its dangerous to put all teens under this blanket  as many are truly suffering from issues that cant be fixed by simply becoming an adult  someone looking for support here doesnt want to have their feelings downplayed and ignored  regardless of the cause of them  ,1
how i found my older brother commited suicide i am    years old right now  and not a day goes by where i dont think about my older brother  people used to ask me when i was a kid if i had any siblings and i would always point to my older brother and say  hes my brother     now i just say im an only child and leave it at that  half of my friends dont know i had a brother  because i dont want to mention it    well  here goes the story that i never told anyone before  me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod  we used to do everything together  play sports  watch movies  and like other brothers  we used to fight  but with every fight  we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other    i used to say rude things to him  i used to call him a jerk and a mean person  but i never really meant it   so my brother was    years old when he was dead  i remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide  and he was complaining about something to dad  that i never really know what until i later realized it was about anxiety    he taught me how to make something called paper airplanes  where you got paper and made them into airplanes  it was fun  i used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far it would land  and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning    every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when i was just waking up  sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other   so one day  i woke up  i looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room  i guess i slept longer than him  but i never do  he usually wakes up at like   am in the morning  i checked the time and it was    am   i made a paper airplane and threw it at his room   he would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when i did but no one came out the room  i opened the door fully and he wasnt in his bed    thats when i looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of  it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was    i saw the closet was mildly open and thats when i saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day  i saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed  and his face with a pale expression  almost like a frown  i remember his skin color looked odd  i thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller  i saw something was holding him up and then i saw the little rope by his throat holding him up  i didnt know what he was doing  i thought it was a prank he made to scare me  i touched his chest and then pushed him  i then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad  by then tears were on my eyes   but i can tell you right now  if i had to choose something that tore me apart more    my brothers lifeless body or my parents reaction to it  i would have chose parents reaction    my dad came into the room  followed by my mom  and for some reason i just didnt want to be in that room anymore and i let myself out to the hallway  then i heard screaming of my brothers name from my mom  and then some type of noise  i think it was my dad pushing my brothers body  like me  they started sobbing  i went to peek back in the room and then i saw my dad shaking and whimpering  he was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me  my brother  and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop  my mom was just standing there with her lips quivering    her teeth shaking  and her eyes were red  i didnt notice it but i was crying too  my whole body was shaking    i ripped up all my paper in my room and i felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides  i then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours  i never wanted to leave the room  and all i could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that i was in  i tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself  i used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up  i scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but i never woke up  i never woke up   every night now  i always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now  and if he would have had a family by now    every year on the day of my brothers death  i throw a paper airplane to a river  and every day i would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed  from my older brother  thats the story of my brothers suicide   ,1

how cant people be depressed seeing how fucked up and selfish humanity is  i just cant bare when i point out animal cruelity  or wage slavery or bullshit in religion or bullshit of politics and non depressed people are like  whatever    what can you do    focus on being productive    oh yea  productivity i love that word  it keeps sheeple in a fucking line    just obey your    loving  overlords and then you will get a cookie and a paycheck to paycheck life   ,1

i tried to ask my family for help  and their answer is  god   im from a third world country  and my entire family is very religious  im not    while i respect their choice to belive in something  they dont respect mine  they think that depression is a joke  that its just an excuse for  lazy  people  i tried to explain to them how the human body works  but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them   im alone  im     i dont have a job  i dont have friends  and the only joy that i have in this world is to talk with my  online friends  and that is starting to fade away  i never met my mother and my father   the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole   hanged himself   years ago  and now i have to hear things like  he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find god    help me internet  ,1

i dont think people really care until you actually die  and even then they might not care if i make a post on reddit i usually get ignored   even when someone listens to me and responds  they usually ghost me after some time   if i want to talk to a professional  they are only there because of money  because they know that its their job and they have to do it because if they dont they wont have money to eat   no one really cares ,1
if i had a gun  right now  id blow my fucking head off  ,1
wake up  browse reddit  watch porn  contemplate suicide  repeat man fuck this shit  people say it gets better  no it gets worse  legitimately considering trying to stab myself in the jugular  i was sexually abused and mutilated and no one cares  people laugh at my problems call me crazy  theres to much contradiction here  hurt me  tell me its no big deal  tell me ill get over it  laugh at me  either kill me or care for me i cant stand this inbetween flip floppy bull shit  its torture  everyone would be better without me anyway im just a problem generator  it hurts so much  if theres a god he knows no mercy     edit fuck  man i need some weed  i need some love  maybe ill find some at the bottom of the river ,1
im planning to kill myself just before i turn    im going to give everyone a nice surprise by ending my life the night before my birthday  i doubt anyone will even miss me  heck everyones probably gonna be happy  if you actually care to want to get to know me before i die  now is your only chance ,1
ever jump to the thought of suicide over minor inconveniences  i can t be the only one i m sure  any minor inconvenience  a mistake i made  getting yelled at by parents  beating myself up over things that are out of my control even   my mind just automatically goes to death in those cases  i guess i ve gotten so used to considering it an option and thinking about it multiples times a day  that when any inconvenience happens  my mind jumps to  you should kill yourself  right away    thing is  when i try to talk to  say  my best friend about it  he listens and then responds with  how can you think these things   i m made to feel as though it s my fault for jumping to the idea of death so easily and thinking the things i do    i feel invalidated when i talk about those thoughts to him  especially if the reason is something small  i usually also get shut down immediately with  that s not you that s thinking these things  it s the thoughts  or  that s not what you want   or better yet   that s dumb stupid    edit  maybe it s because the idea of suicide brings me peace and calms me down in overwhelming situations  i know that if i kill myself  all my problems will go away and i won t have to be worried about anything anymore  it s probably weird to say the idea of killing myself makes me happy or brings me peace but it literally does somehow  ,1
not expecting much from here  even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless i just need to vent   im a single gay man in my late   s  seen multiple mental health professionals over the years  been there  done that  have a couple of college degrees  i dont drink or do drugs   i always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment  i found myself working with autistic children and public service which i liked  but its not a stable job  i had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation  not important what   realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over  i quickly landed a job in corporate america   then i was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the da  i got five years probation and two suspended sentence  i was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew   my job  my neighbors  my family  a year into probation  i got violated for having a bullet  ironically  i had purchased a gun in case i was facing serious time  so i went to prison for two years  it was awful  there was nothing rehabilitative about it  while everyone talked about getting high once they got out  i talked about getting a job   i was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood  i found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check  a year later  it went out of business  i said  fuck it  and started applying for those high paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check  it worked  i landed the highest paying job i ever got  with health insurance too  it was a lot of work  but worth it   lately i had been feeling suicidal  burned out  anxious  overwhelmed  the one thing that kept me going was my job  it took up most of my time and gave me financial peace  which is underrated    then i got fired today   not sure what happened  but three months into the job and passing my background check  they fired me for lying  its beyond me how they found out  i think a co worker found out and dropped a dime on me  i was a good worker  i left feeling ashamed  degraded  defeated  etc  i cant do this again  its not like there was good jobs for a middle age felon  thats a lie  been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didnt and couldnt help  it had to be up to me   to keep on trying to make it is senseless  its insanity   i called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor  he was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days  i wasnt expecting anything   i think he understood  killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years   ive been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief  i thought about killing myself only after my mom dies  but truth be told i have been and am in too much pain and its not fair to me  id rather die and leave my savings to her  i feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something  they couldnt or wouldnt    there is this part of me that fears death less  what i fear is my future  at least death is inevitable   again  not expecting anything life changing on here  the next few days will be brutal  i have crossed a point of no return today     x   b   edit  i spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass  binge eating and sleeping  i looked in the mirror and look like shit  my apartment is a wreck  i thought to myself what my next step is and all of them were  tying  up loose ends  its just too complicated  high risk low reward  expensive  much pressure  etc  to move on with life  it takes up too much of my life and i was already dealing with too much and i dont have the energy to do it anymore  people like me who choose life under these circumstances end up going back to prison and or on the streets  id rather die  ,1
  weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows november          i attempted suicide  i have not told anyone  or very little people  i tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress  after the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted     i havent really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot  the work day after my suicide attempt was different  i noticed people actually seemed to care  or  i saw some accomplishment in myself  i yet to seek help for my mental issues  but so far im trying to figure things out  ,1
my sister told me to kill myself my sister and i used to be best friends  but i noticed as when she grew older  she started to develop a  grudge  against me  she got angry at me more easily  and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone  i tried to connect with her because i still loved her  but she would shut me out of her life  and because of this  my sister and i havent spoken to each other in three months   my sister was up at      am today and i couldnt sleep so i went to her room and told her to go to bed  she started yelling at me while mom heard her  and went upstairs  as soon as she reached her room  she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed   five minutes after that happened  i heard a voice in the dark say   i hate you  i wish you would die  go kill yourself    i realized that it was coming from my sisters room  i got up and said   what  what did you just say     i hate you  i wish you would kill yourself  just die already    i didnt know why she was saying this  so i started crying and went downstairs  my heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy   i told my parents everything  and my mom went upstairs again to confront her  my dad stayed with me  and held me as i cried  he said that he was very disappointed at her  even though she was his favorite    mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning   she never did  in fact  she pretended that  nothing  ever happened  she pretended that i didnt even exist  she was happy   the worst part  was how my sister  knew  i was suicidal  back when she was  nice   i told her about my feelings and how i wanted to kill myself  and she shared my sympathy  now  she shames me because of it  she shames me for being depressed and tells me that i was a mistake and blames me for my parents suffering  she told me that i was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite  she told me that she hated me everyday   this morning  i tried to hang myself with my dads belt  but i failed   now i have to wake up everyday  knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone   edit  part     https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments cgh nz my  sister  told  me  to  kill  myself  part      https   www reddit com r suicidewatch comments cgh nz my sister told me to kill myself part     ,1
i dont think life sucks  i just genuinely believe living isnt for everyone grew up in a household with parents passively hating eachother for the past    years openly in front of me and my siblings but wont divorce because they cant do well financially on their own  would often talk bad about the other to us and would use us to communicate when they wouldnt want to talk to eachother    did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and i started having anxiety and panic attacks  i couldnt focus anymore and started giving up on school  stopped doing all activities i used to love and harmed myself    started having suicidal thoughts and a year after i attempted  felt a little better after some hospitalization  but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments   was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend  ive been so happy with him these past months  but with him only  i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before  except when i was spending time with him    i dont have any goals in life anymore  i cant go to college and i work minimum wage  also  im really sensitive about whats going on in the world and it makes me loose hope for humanity    i dont think life sucks  i genuinely just believe living isnt for everyone  some people are able to make the most of it and find happiness  but some just dont have the right mentally and tools and it should be okay for them to leave if thats what makes them happy    it hurts to have someone you love die  i understand that  but what good does it make to try and keep someone who isnt happy and wont be happy in the future and let them suffer for years to come  wouldnt that hurt    also before you guys mention my boyfriend  yeah i love him  but love never really lasts  and at this point  im so sensitive that if we ever have a fight or go through a rough time  i would definitely break and kill myself  cause hes pretty much the only thing that still makes me genuinely happy  and i cant imagine how bad it would be if i left that way  i dont want him to blame himself  he doesnt deserve that  i would rather leave when were still on great terms  ,1
i want someone to take care of me like they d take care of a child i guess this is my survival instinct s last line of defence  this naive and delusional hope that someone could come and pick up the pieces of me  gently put me back together  literally provide for me and take care of all the adult stuff  hold me when i cry and relieve me of any responsibilities until i m actually capable of getting back up on my feet  and that everything will be okay after that    i m     but i can t take care of myself  i know people around me think i can  because this wall i ve built around myself is tall enough that no one can see the dumpster fire going on inside it  everything s falling apart and i m sitting here just crying  because i ve put off asking for help for so long  that the amount of help i would need right now isn t available    also  it s like i m no longer sad because things are shitty  i m sad because this delusional hope  that s just survival instinct in disguise  clouds my judgement and catches me between a rock and a hard place  i m exhausted  ,1
does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal  i feel like i could end it all at any second and get some relief  but i also go through the motions of life like im planning to live for so much longer  i go to class for the most part  eat food  try to look groomed on the outside  in a way  i feel like people cant take me seriously  all my so called friends just look at me like theres nothing wrong with me  even though i tell them things  its like the end of the day i look okay on paper  so i must be okay  my parents know i feel like this but they already have my life planned out and i feel trapped  its been a constant trend in my life where even if i tell people im struggling  no one believes me  i think thats part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help  i dont know if im the only one who feels this way   edit  im honestly surprised at how much attention this has gotten  i just want you all to know that your feelings and thoughts are valid no matter what and should be treated as such  theres still a lot of stigma about mental health in general but i fully believe everyone is entitled to treatment and a therapist who will sympathetically listen to their problems no matter what  none of you deserve anything less than that  ive tried my best to respond to all the people who responded but my inbox is always open to messages if anyone wants to say anything  thank you guys so much for making me feel like this isnt so abnormal ,1
i stay alive because i m guilted into remaining on this earth to avoid causing pain to my loved ones  i wish i had the inner strength to actually follow through on my plan   take a greyhound bus to a different state and and kill myself there  no one would be able to identify me  i would be a jane doe and my loved ones would just think i got kidnapped or something   ,1
killing myself isnt selfish why should i give a fuck about other peoples feelings when i end it  they never gave a fuck about mine when i was alive  not my family  not the people i know    me ending my own pain is not selfish  and if i am selfish  so fucking what  every single cunt on this earth is selfish  people are selfish for wanting someone who wants to help themselves to live on for their own benefit  i dont give a fuck    if you dont give a shit about me when i was alive  dont come crying to my funeral like a fucking idiot  fuck off  ,1
i got into a car accident this morning and my last thought before impact was  i hope this kills me   i hit my head and likely have a concussion  i ve had headaches and slight dizziness all day  can t afford the doctors bills  and it s the end of the year so it s not like paying towards my deductible would do any good  so  may as well say fuck it  hope that i die in my sleep  and let it be  suicide to me has become similar to the ending of batman begins   i won t kill you  but i don t have to save you   so bring on the tobacco  liquor  or whatever  let it be  stoicistic suicide   ,1
is there anyone else struggling today  or is it just me  ,1
relationships are temporary  be it friendship or romantic relationships  i feel so alone and i can t grasp   hold on to anything because they always just go away at the end  it s so painful to live i don t wanna see another day  i feel like i m living inside a game that i can t quit  we are all alone  you are either aware of it or you are not   ,1
the biggest lie i have ever been told was that you should treat others the way you d want to be treated  people will treat you like shit regardless  you can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to  i am done trying to be good to people who aren t good to me  the funny part is after it s all said and done  you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren t in that situation  i just don t care enough to live in a world that doesn t care about me  ,1
 death is permanent you can t come back  it s amazing to me how many people say this sort of thing to stop someone from wanting to kill themself    don t you get it  that s the point  i don t want to be here  i don t want to change my mind  do you really think i m so delusional that i believe i ll die then decide i could have lived longer and come back  are you really so delusional you don t see i want to die because it means i won t be coming back  ,1
how many times do i have to google  i want to kill myself  before i actually do it   ,1
took the pills  drink the beer  get cold and post on reddit before i die  been putting off killing myself  but i took the pills  benzos and opiates and can depressant meds  this time  drank some beer to kick it all into gear    fingers and legs are getting very cold      i just wanted to say goodbye to everyone here    you all tried your best  edit  added some more meds to make sure it does the trick  just so done       dec  th        i am so sorry to all of you  i did end up overdosing  but not enough to finish the job  i ended up getting really sick though and puking on pretty much everything  i have a traumatic brain injury  childhood abuse and concussions  and so it affected me a ton because of that  i spent the last several days not able to focus my eyes  i would wander around my room like a zombie  not able to comprehend pretty much anything  i am on a ton of meds for other medical stuff and i got really sick from not taking my meds when i was not able to think clearly  i am finally able to read  and comprehend   otherwise  i would have updated you all    i honestly didnt think my post would get any attention  and i remember only bits and pieces of the last several days  i am still not to      but no one knows  except for my friend who has also attempted  i didnt want any judgment    i am doing okay  had some sis creep in again but i beat them back  i am still in a daze that i could have died    and i was  and am still  okay with that  but now it feels like life is super surreal      you are all really kind  and seeing this much love from so many strangers has helped me in a significant way ,1
i often fantasize about what others would do if i ended it i imagine my teachers talking to my classmates about how i was found hanging in my room  i imagine people finally realizing that i wasnt just having a few bad days  that me saying  i want to kill myself  everyday was real  i imagine the utter sadness and horror people would experience knowing that id done it  i feel like i get closer every day  every molecule of my very being is begging for the end  and i dont think i can keep holding them back for long  ,1
i honestly cant come to terms with the fact that i will spend the rest of my life working  for nothing  and that i have no choice but to be a wage slave  it just drains me so much i feel like nothing is worth it  ,1
anyone wish they would get hit by a car or bus or get an incurable cancer  instead of the stigma their family would receive from suicide  i wish i got hit by a car or bus or got some incurable disease to die  i truly wish somebody facing death from a disease could have my body so that they could use it well and develop friends and relationships and spend time with their family and pursue their dreams  trade me please  i know what i would be walking into and wouldn t regret a thing    i don t want my family to receive the stigma from my suicide  people will think they have failed me or that our family is broken  it s not true  it s me and my fault   people can say you ll be dead so why would you care  truth is we don t know for sure what happens after death  ,1
i feel like a robot that the only way to turn my feelings off and put my mind on  numb mode  is by aimlessly watching youtube videos i wish i was dead ,1
someone saved my life today i know this is a bit different from what people typically post on this thread but i don t know who to tell  i don t want to tell anyone that i was minutes away from killing myself  but that s exactly what just happened    i m up at college right now  it s my third semester  things haven t been easy for me  i ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder  all my roommates have gone home for the holidays  they finished their finals yesterday and i still had one more to do today    i ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues  i recently changed my major to geology from accounting  my mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family    out of the   kids in her family are accountants   my dad is an economics major  they don t see any value in geology at all and so we ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life  this  however  isn t the first time my family has feuded with me  i m sort of the black sheep of the family  anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling  they refuse to give me their ssn for my federal student aid application  and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill i m declared a dependent and my university can t override my fafsa application  i tried to get a loan with my bank where i have my own independent account  but they said a co signer is required for my loan  my parents refuse to sign it  i reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and i shouldn t worry about going home  my brother and i go to the same university    i wrote my suicide note and i was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication  paxil   everything felt entirely perfect  i was alone in my apartment  done with schooling  all of my friends had gone home  it felt right  but right as i went to get a glass of water  someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door    i answer the door  my paxil bottle in my hand still  and there s a girl i ve seen once or twice around  she says  hey  my name   all my roommates are gone and i was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie  i m an extrovert so i just feel weird doing stuff alone    i don t think she knew what was happening  but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from god  like maybe god or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive  even though everything seems awful right now  after she left i sobbed and it felt like everything just changed  like a light switch went off    when i go home i m going to check into a psych ward and get the help i ve been procrastinating on getting  i m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder  and remember what happened tonight    the timing of everything that happened tonight wasn t a coincidence at all   ,1
i catch myself wanting to go  home  but not knowing where that even is i catch myself saying it in a room of people  at work  while driving  while in my bed  while eating in a restaurant  doesn t matter where  it s just always playing in my mind  i ve never really felt at home anywhere  and i hate saying it because of that  ,1
psa from the mod team  please dont report posts just because they seem high risk to you  thanks  weve had a sudden uptick of anonymous people  or possibly one energetic person  clicking  report  and specifying something like  viable threat of self harm  as the report reason   we have no idea what the motivation is for these reports  but this is a dangerous and ill advised practice for the following reasons      reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter   this is entirely outside the moderators control      the criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random  and  do not correspond to established  evidence based risk assessment criteria  http   redd it  c nqf        most of the reported posts have had some good  supportive responses  so there doesnt appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators         what it says in the sidebar is true   we dont have the resources to trace the source of any post  but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting   so wed like to point out that  outing  someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it  especially in the long term  by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings   involuntary interventions are almost never necessary  and almost always traumatic   its important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention   it saves far more lives than it costs   the times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions  as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it     if you think an op needs any kind of special help or intervention from the sw mod team  please  send us a modmail  http   www reddit com message compose to   fr  fsuicidewatch   thanks    ,1
attempted suicide two years ago  just got facebook timeline and saw something    i attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago   it wasnt much of a suicide attempt as it was a   hey  im gonna do this  and if it happens to kill me  whatever   i was unconscious for over    hours  my roommate was the only person who knew at the time  i just told him i got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day  i had taken three half full bottles of pills  it was a spur of the moment decision and i had convinced myself that i wasnt doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out  two days later i could barely move  my head was pounding  my heart was pounding  and it was hard to breathe  i may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason   i dont remember much of that semester  or really that whole year  so i was surprised to find some facebook posts just today   looking back  i posted every day  something  oftentimes a little cry for help  even if it sounded silly  and then  there was a three day period where i posted nothing  i knew immediately what those three days were  but there was one post on my wall    it was from my sister       brudder  are you alive        holy shit   i read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when i was about to die  my sister was thinking about me  i chose to wear a blindfold of self pity and tried to convince myself no one cared  dont be a fucking idiot like i was  if i had killed myself  i would have killed my sister  and plenty of other people  too   if you want to be selfish  be selfish enough to get help   i hope someone reads this and gets something out of it  my sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened     tl dr   sister jokingly asked if i was still alive after i almost killed myself    ,1

is it possible that im just too lazy for life  thats it  i feel im just too lazy for life  i have lost motivation and interest in everything  im not looking forward for future at all and i dont enjoy living   i dont know what is so wrong with me  i force myself to do things i have to do  exercise on regular basis  although all i want to do is just sleep or lock myself in a room without seeing anyone  but even i force myself  motivation still doesnt come  its like i have lost interest in life   im very tired of putting on a mask to hide how disfunctional i actually am  i need to constantly pretend that i care and im interested in everything  or that im present while im doing something when my mind just cant stop imagining about death every single moment    i dont think i will be able to do suicide because my parents would be too traumatized by it  but i honestly dont know how long i can keep going and i welcome death  or if there was a dangerous situation that could lead me to death  i probably wont escape   its like im existing but im already dead  i feel so inhuman  ,1
sometimes i wish something tragic would happen in my life so i have a reason to justify my depression  it s fucked up thinking i know but i just got these weird af scenarios in my head and i know it ain t right    i know i don t have enough to be sad about even tho i know that s not how it works  ,1
why do people freak out so much when they find out you want to die  it s an honest question  like  it s hard to believe there are actually people on this planet who think life is worth living  i honestly cant wait until i dont exist anymore    ,1
 committing suicide would be selfish  because its making your loved ones live in pain for the rest of their lives just so you wont have to suffer   uh  so then arent you pretty selfish for forcing me to live in pain for my entire life just so you wont have to suffer  sorry for title gore   im getting so sick of my being suicidal automatically being attacked with accusations of being selfish  because of how much it will affect the people around me if i did it   which  by the way  is pretty much the only fucking reason im still here  ive been suffering for a long time  the only reason im putting up with it and havent just killed myself already is basically for my family  so they wont have to find my body  so i wont leave the couple of friends i have alone  so no one else will have to suffer like im being forced to  but no  yeah  im the selfish one   i dont want to live anymore  youre the fucking selfish one for forcing me to just for your own fucking happiness when ive been telling you for years that i am not  happy  it hurts  it really hurts  if you truly loved me  you would let me end it  ,1
failure i can never do anything right  all i ever do it mess up and fail  so whats the point of trying    im a pathetic excuse for a human being  i cant do anything  i cant do taxes  my life is in shambles  im disgustingly overweight  im dumb and boring  i just dont have anything going for me  im as empty and hollow as a doll  id be better off that way  because as a human im a failure and always will be  ,1
sometimes i just look in the mirror and realize that im not cut out for life   ,1
everyone in my family i cared about is dead at    and anxiety is making me want to die  my dad was an alcoholic and killed himself when i was     my uncle who was like a father figure to me died of cancer when i was     my grandpa who was also like a father figure to me died of a major artery burst when i was     my mom was very mentally ill  she attempted suicide many times throughout my life since i was a kid and in some ways she was emotionally abusive to me but i still cared about her and she died of cancer last march  im     im living on my own now and have to pay bills but the problem is i have nearly crippling anxiety which makes it hard to work because almost everytime i go in the whole time i have really bad anxiety and keep having the thought repeat in my head that id rather kill myself than continue feeling like this  ive been working for   weeks now and almost everyday ive burst into tears while working  for the last month ive spent every day wandering whether or not i should kill myself i really enjoy living and for now im too scared to kill myself but anxiety is a cunt  ,1
there was a double murder suicide in my family last night  trigger warning     trigger warning     murder  suicide  gun violence  child involved  cheating  news making a mockery of tragedy  names are all fake   i    f  have two younger brothers  we  me  mike    m   and max    m  all have different fathers  we ve never lived with mike s dad  but he s been a father figure to us throughout our lives   now comes the awfulness   last night one of my father figures  did a terrible thing  he shot and murdered two people  and then he turned the gun on himself   so basically    my little brother mike s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink  then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it  and then dan shot himself in the head and killed himself  he murdered two people and committed suicide                dan  was a good person  he was a great biological father to my middle brother  mike   his other   children  and a father figure to me as mike s older sister  i was a    month old baby when dan met my mom  a little over a year later  my little brother mike  age     came along  dan    s  and my mom    s  didn t stay together  but he was always good to us throughout our lives   and then this   dan had a long term girlfriend   rachel   dan recently found out that rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time  and last night he hit his absolute breaking point  dan wanted rachel out of his house  and she refused to go  apparently she paraded around in front of him  wearing the sweater of the man she s with on the side  basically flaunting the cheating and telling dan that he s becoming an old man  that she can do better  have any guy she wants  but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her  she s telling him all of this  meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper  he tells her to get the hell out of the house  he tells her that he s had enough  we can tell he s losing control at this point   that s when dan s older son bill  age    and mike s biological big brother  gets in the middle  bill tries to settle his father down  and get rachel to shut up because everyone can tell dan is at his boiling point  they don t  at this point  bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his   year old son  eli  and move out and leave the house  because they can t stand the fighting  because they need to support eli  bill and megan were going to move out anyway  bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses  but dan tells him to go  bill leaves   that s when things got worse    rachel keeps screaming and taunting dan  the others are scared and frozen  dan pushes rachel into the wall  and starts hurting her  megan calls rachel s brother because dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way  rachel s hitting dan and scratching at him  screaming she doesn t love him and he has no right to touch her  that she has every right to be here as dan is grabbing at her  shoving her into the wall and towards the door  megan calls rachel s brother for help  because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid dan will really hurt her because he s much bigger   rachel s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down  the brother gets in the middle  taking rachel s side  defending her actions  it doesn t help  dan leaves the room fuming    we d never seen him so angry     and comes back with a shotgun loaded    the first shot goes off  and hits rachel in the stomach  she collapsed with blood everywhere  megan grabs baby eli and runs upstairs  and rachel s brother runs for the door  he makes it out of the house and partway down the drive  into his van  before dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly  then    then dan comes back into the living room  he levels the shotgun at himself     and then shoots himself in the head   meanwhile  megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls bill  the older son  and her boyfriend   and      the police run in and bill gets there right about the same time  running inside to get his girlfriend and son  he d only been gone for like   minutes    just   minutes   the police run in  and check on everyone  rachel is still alive  so a lifeflight is called in for her  we heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter    so basically    my little brother mike s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink  then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it  and then dan shot himself in the head and killed himself  he murdered two people and committed suicide   my little brother is an absolute mess  the news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened  swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment  horrible sick people  someone said something about publishing this in the paper  and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy  everyone is hysterical    the police have already ruled it a murder suicide    my little brother mike is a mess  my mom is a mess  and i m trying so hard to be strong  mike can t understand why his father would do that  why he d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself    taking the cowards way out  the suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body    luckily  mike s older brother bill  the girlfriend megan  and little eli is okay  but we are all damaged  how will anything ever be okay again    this is senseless   i ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family  now i m collapsed at my fiancé s  just taking it all in while he holds me tight  i ve already put an email in to my therapist  sorry about the crappy writing  and if this is difficult to understand  it s a complicated situation and i m barely functioning                 edit  the news story is out and apparently rachel survived  she coded and died en route to the hospital  but apparently they eventually got her back  she s alive  but in critical condition  ,1
technically if i did kill myself the problem would be gone  ,1
no job  no friends  and family that sees me as a disappointment  i know these type of posts are seen all the time so i don t expect a lot of interaction with mine  i just need a place to vent since i really have no one else to go to  i ve felt like a loner for years now but i m at my absolute lowest at the moment  the one companion of mine that i had for almost   years  my dog  passed away last month  i always said i wouldn t kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that he s gone i see no other reason to keep going  i graduated from college this past december and haven t been able to land a job since  most days i just sit and play video games because i just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say they re hiring for entry level but require    years of experience  i don t have any skills  i tried to learn programming but honestly i m just not very tech savy and i just don t have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse  i feel like i ve let my family down  especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college  killing myself would just be doing them a favor  at least i would no longer be a burden  the people i thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process  only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol  i don t see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers won t kill me  the alcohol poisoning sure will    ,1
i hung myself  but woke up on the floor  i tried to hang myself with a belt two days ago   i blacked out and woke up on the floor   the leather around my belt buckle broke    i dont know how long i was unconscious  but i must have hit my head and hip very hard when i fell    i have some broken blood vessels in my left eye   i have no one to talk to about this   i dont know how i feel about it    im not feeling any relief that it didnt work     ,1
i wish someone would murder me so i don t seem like a disappointment to my parents and people don t judge my parents based off of my decision   ,1
my dog stopped me i changed all my emergency contact info from my parents to someone else months ago  this way my school and local police department would never know who my guardians were  today has been the hardest day in the past few months  a situation that happened to me when i was    happened to me again today  i already have really bad ptsd  so today made it worse    i cut myself for the first time in a long time  but i did it vertically this time  i tried to kill myself but my dog came up next to me and tried to lick my hands  i love him more than anything  i want him to never experience pain or sadness  i want my dog to have the best life fucking possible  he s the only reason i didn t kill myself tonight   ,1
i always tell this board i m going to kill myself    and i always really mean it when i post it  then i wake up the next morning and feel okay again  sometimes it takes a little longer  maybe by the next afternoon  and then i delete my posts on here   it s better to post here than to tell someone i know in my life  here  i m just an anonymous weirdo that keeps crying wolf  barely anyone even comments    years ago i used to tell the people closest to me when i felt like this and it drove them away  it got me sent to a hospital and then stuck with a medical bill i couldn t afford   it s better to just post and delete here  just another name on this board  i ll probably never really do it anyhow   ,1
as of   hour ago  literally all my friends are dead  all left me in         my best friend was the first to go  she started doing heroin against my warnings  a week after her first time trying it  she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers  i remember the last text i got from her      next was someone i reconnected with at her service  i hadnt seen him in years  so we started hanging out and stuff again  he never told me he had a pill problem   he probably knew i would have stopped talking to him    he overdosed a month after we got close again   two days before that  my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway  his car flipped and his neck snapped on impact    this year has been emotional torment  i said i couldnt handle any more losses  then an hour ago  i get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer    i cant do this anymore  im sick to my stomach  im all alone  i have literally no one to talk to    all the people i could find comfort in are gone      maybe if there is an afterlife i can see them again    ,1

it s impossible to talk about suicide people don t wanna hear about it  suicide lines are bs  if you do open up to someone they suddenly become responsible for your well being which is a difficult position to be in for them  it s also emotionally draining to listen to someone talk about it  i feel like a burden because being suicidal makes me one  ,1
something worth considering the next time a case of the bad feels hits     ,1
do you ever think about how wonderful it would have been to never have existed  no pain  no happiness  just nothing   i sometimes think about this universe and wish it never existed  so i don t have any chance of reincarnation or after life  just for nothing    to have never experienced anything  ,1
i want to go home i want to go home   not to a place in my mind i once knew    not to my birthplace  or the town where i grew   not to my family that left me alone    not to the land or the house that i own    not to the west where my heart says i should be    not to the places i would one day see   not to the bed where i lay down at night    not to my  friends  who stay out of sight    each day it gets harder and harder to stay   afraid to tell anyone the things i should say   my mind has betrayed me like everything else   i finally realize  i have to do it myself    the truth that i find so incredibly sad   i have no home  not like i once had   i am tired  i am weak  i am angry  alone    i have made up my mind       i am going home   ,1
today i threw away my rope throwaway since i dont really want this on my main account and im not sure if it belongs here  i wrote my suicide note yesterday and attempted suicide  i wont bore you with the details of that but it didnt work  dont think i did it right  this morning  i took my rope that i have  the only rope i had  specifically for that purpose  and i threw it in the trash  i ripped up my suicide note  ive told myself that im going to stay here and fight  even if i dont win  im going to give it a damn good go    it might seem rather insignificant  but throwing that rope away  the rope that was always there for me to use if i felt like it  is a big step for me   ,1
i hate how i actually have a decent life and i still despise myself i struggle to relate with the stories of people with actual depression struggling to get out of bed  have a shower  and do basic tasks  they often talk about how socially isolated they are  how they dont have any friends or family to turn to    i hate how i hate myself and how unhappy i am despite being none of the above  i actually have great friends and loving parents and im sure if i were to open up to them they would      listen to me and help me through my sadness  thats the worst part  i dont want anyone worrying about me  it would break my heart to think that my parents and friends  in the back of their minds  are constantly worrying about whether or not im going to kill myself     do you know how many late night texts ive drafted  how many times ive lied in bed crying myself to sleep  wishing desperately that i could tell someone how much i hate living    i dont even know what i want anymore  i have skills and hobbies  im doing well in school  i have meaningful relationships  its like somewhere along my life  the part of me that could be happy left my side  i could have everything in the world  but ill never have self satisfaction  ,1
im actually excited about the corona virus and hope it kills me or changes life overall for the human race so my life isnt so fucking meaningless all the time  i know no one here really cares about this and thats not a surprise  in todays society  everyone is so fucking selfish  seriously  everyone either cares about money or clout or both  i dont have either of those and i do envy those who are spoiled  my life isnt bad at all and in fact i have many more advantages than most people my age  but i still feel like theres no purpose  i get a degree from university  so what  then i have to work a boring ass fucking office job for years   hours a day only having some time on the weekends for a few hours  what is the fucking point  i swear it feels like a fucking prision  the only thing i semi enjoy is gaming but you cant make a career out of it today  and yes  i know it is possible  but it is not probable   so dont give me that shit about  just try  like fuck off    overall i honestly feel like theres no purpose in life  like when thinking about killing myself i try to remember to before i was born and what it was like and i realize i cant remember anything because i didnt exist  it was like a void  the same will happen when i kill myself  no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans cant even comphrend   i dont know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me  they have goals and are doing stuff  i have no goals  i have no ambitions and dont care what anyone else thinks  one day i will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy  fml    also sorry about the grammar im not gonna edit it cause im a lazy shit  ,1
i made it to       before on this subreddit i posted about how i was going to end it all in my birthday before i turned     here i am though  although my family situation hasn t gotten a lot better there s still proof that it s going to get better over a course of a year or so  anyways don t mind this i just feel proud  ,1
i feel sucidal again  i hate being suicidal  should i call them  ,1
i think my depression is finally passing  ive found a reason to live  i dont want to die anymore  and im beginning to enjoy the things i used to love before  i feel happy for once  not that numbness i felt for so long  its been a difficult battle but i think im winning it  ,1
why is suicide so bad anyway  people keep trying to talk me out of it  i dont get why  they keep using different types of arguments  and i really dont believe in any of them   is it selfish because of the people who care about you  well  how is me living a life i dont want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them  moreover  what about the people who have no one to care for them  not my case  but still  its quite a common cause of suicide   is it cowardly  i really dont think so  every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it  so coming to the decision  and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination   do things get better  well  what if they fucking dont  for years  i keep hoping to get to a better life  to start properly enjoying it  but it just doesnt work out  i even moved to a different country  hoping for a new and better  life  truth be told  im just not meant to live a good life  i dont know  maybe i was a massive asshole in a past life if thats a thing  and now karma is working its way   people are so hypocritical  i swear  they all use the  my body  my choice  argument to support transgender people and more others  but this was the first that came into my mind   yet they fail to acknowledge that this principle works exactly the same for suicidal people  i never asked for this  if well  obviously hypothetically speaking  i could have gotten a choice whether to be born or not  i might have just said no  so i should have a right to end my miserable existence whenever the hell i want  after all  i have a right to live  not an obligation to do so  huge difference    edit   in all fairness  i have to admit that there are situations in which suicide is kind of a dick move  for example  if you have children which still depend on you  killing yourself would more or less ruin their future  so yes  in that case  i disagree with suicide  however  im single and i dont have any kids or any other person whose life depends on me other than myself   so offing myself would not affect anyone in the end  ,1
wanted to share this with you guys   i asked out a girl today  xpost from r foreveraloneadating   i was on the train to penn station and i saw a       girl reading a book and sat next to her  along the way i asked  good book   and she said yeah and told me about it  then  when the train arrived  i said   im sorry but i have to ask ill hate myself if i dont   you are absolutely gorgeous and you seem really nice  if i gave you my number would you give me a call   she said sure and took my number  ,1
ive lost my son to suicide last week hello humanity   last thursday  my son alex took his own life  he left no note and there was no indication of his intention to do this  our family came together in this great sorrow   i would like people to take away light from this event  alex was     he was a beautiful and kind person that knew how to give but had difficulty in receiving   we  all of us question what more we could have done to bring more love into his life  but we have no answers and we feel a profound sorrow at the loss of  this beautiful man   please  i ask that anyone just please take a breath if this is your contemplation and know that you are loved even if in your moment of despair in that dark place  please find that you are love and that you have love to give in this world  there are still people  perhaps some you have not even met yet that need your love in their own life   know you are light and you shine farther than you yourself may be able to perceive  know this  take that breath  find your peace in the love you have and the love you get   peace  ,1

this may be really selfish but its my opinion ive seen lots of people saying that if you die  the people around will be sad and angry at themselves etc    but the thing is  if im dead  i cant  see  or  experience  the repercussions of my death and i think i prefer that to feel like shit all the time  i know this is a awful way of thinking  so yeah  im probably only still alive cause i dont have the courage to do anything    p s  english isnt my first language so please excuse any mistakes ,1

thank you  reddit  for keeping me alive theres a lot of pain and sadness here  but theres also a lot of hope and a lot of people who genuinely care  more than most of the therapists ive ever had  to be honest  no one here is going to commit you to a hospital  or rat you out to your boss  or tell you to just cheer up and take a zumba class   seriously  i wish i were making that last one up     i came here a year ago because i wanted to kill myself  i spent a year here thinking about it  ive spent the past two months deciding that i   dont   want to kill myself  someday in the future maybe ill swing back to wanting it  you know what  no matter what  ill always have this place to write my thoughts down  and ill always have people here who will listen to my stupid problems  all that money spent on therapy and meds and the place that made me not want to kill myself was right here for free  go figure   i wish that the guy who killed himself two months ago   would post his user name but i assume rules wont allow for that   was here to read this  that his posts got me on this path in the first place  i hope hes at peace now  anyway    to everyone else  please keep on posting and replying to things  youre all fucking amazing   ,1
i wish i could be legally euthanized i have schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype  medication works for me only some of the time  and the side effects make it so that even when i am sane i am trapped in a state of joyless sedated apathy  antipsychotics took every last little bit of imagination and happiness i had left and now i am a shell who literally goes to work  comes home  and stares at the wall until i can fall asleep  i am    and have been sick for over    years now   how am i supposed to keep going for another    years like this  poor  barely able to work  still surrounded by hallucinations on the regular because the horrible medications dont even work properly on me  if i take my meds  life becomes a chore that offers no relief  if i dont take my meds  i have crazy states of mania and hallucinations and end up jobless and alone  i feel like this illness stole everything from me  i wish i could go to the doctor and tell them  i am incurably mentally ill and i would like to die  and be offered an option for a peaceful death  i wish that there was an end to this suffering  ,1
i lied to my therapist  i m just done  and at this point i don t think i can be talked out of it  you can t save people that don t want to be saved  i just want someone to know  i don t think anyone will read this  but if you do  thanks  throwaway account for privacy    i know people will think i m posting this because i still have some shred of hope or some part of me wants to live  but that s not it  like i said  i don t think anyone can talk me out of it now  i just want someone to know  everyone on this sub is completely disconnected from me personally  and that makes me feel better   i m young      and i understand there s so many years that i could have  i just don t want them  i ve contemplated suicide a few times over the years  i m sure everyone has  but it was always a fleeting thought  now it s constant   i just lost a parent  i m in so much pain  not just mental  mostly physical actually  i live with health conditions that leave me in pain every second of every day  no matter what i do  the odd thing is  i m not depressed  i deal with crippling anxiety  but not so much depression   i ve been in therapy for a couple years now  she s an amazing therapist  i genuinely couldn t ask for anything more  she has tried very hard  the only time i ve ever admitted wanting to die is last week  i regretted saying it immediately  she asked a couple questions  i answered honestly but told her i didn t want to say anything else as i was scared she would tell my mother and i would be committed  she said she didn t have to break confidentiality unless she suspected i was a danger to myself  doing things like stockpiling  planning etc   so obviously i didn t admit that i had been doing those things  because i don t want to be stopped   i honestly don t understand why we try so hard to save people that don t want to be saved  if someone wants to die  and they are so determined that they will do whatever it takes to make it happen  let them do it  at least they d be able to go out with some shred of dignity  i ve set a date to do it multiple times  and then backed out at the last minute  but tonight s the night  i m done backing out  i was scared this morning  and then counted how much i had stockpiled and was suddenly so relieved and for the first time in a while  felt excited  i can t wait to go to sleep and not have to wake up resentful that i m waking up   i feel bad that my family will have to find me  but not bad enough that i m not going to do it   i don t really want to die  but i don t want to live in this pain either  i ve weighed the pros and cons  and dying just outweighs living for me   thank you for reading  i hope everyone else on here can find peace with whatever decision they make  ,1
i feel pathetic for posting this  but i m gonna try to go to sleep  and it would mean a lot to me just to have a few nice comments when i wake up  it doesn t have to be much  but if you could just say something that would be awesome  i just want to feel like someone cares  it s been a bad night     edit  thank you everyone who reached out to me last night     if i had the energy  i would reply to every single message i got  i really appreciate y all s support and i m gonna try to make each day better than the last  ,1
is anyone else not able to cry  a lot of people have told me that i shouldnt bottle up or hide my emotions  because that would only makes things worse  and that i should express what im feeling  but the problem is i have nothing to express or bottle up  i dont feel anything  nothing makes me happy or excited anymore  although ive gotten pretty good at faking it so people around me dont realize just how dead i am inside  i dont feel sad ever either  things happen that should make me sad or any other emotion but theres nothing there  i feel like i should feel something  but i dont  im just so desensitized to it all i just dont care anymore  and i know i should cry  and ive tried  but i cant  nothing happens  im just there  as dead as ever with no tears or emotions or anything  at night  when i lay awake  im just blank  i just want to feel something again even if its sadness because i cant keep going feeling so empty inside  ,1
wish i could press a button to die instantly killing yourself is so much work ,1
zero motivation to live but zero motivation to die  just kinda want to not exist but not die at the same time  i dont know if that makes sense  feeling massively depressed for most of my life growing up and i feel like even if i get over depression i wont get over trauma i experienced which sorta still creeps up on me  at times i wish i could disappear cause i feel it wouldnt matter  but i cant make myself do it cause i know itd hurt people even if i tell myself they wouldnt bother     i get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which i guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow   the only time i feel something genuinely is when i hurt myself but it leaves my face bruised and its hard to make up excuses when people ask but sometimes i wish someone would ask about it genuinely because its draining feeling this disconnected from the world and myself and im too afraid to find help so it just eats away at me ,1
stop promoting the stupid ass hotlines  they suck  i honestly want to off myself even more when i see them  horrible service overall and they have no fucking idea what theyre doing most of the time  hats off to them for trying though  ,1

my best friend of     years is engaged to the man who sexually assaulted me i have always had a shitty life but this just takes the cake   in      i was raped  it was the hardest time in my life  and i attempted suicide then  clearly i survived and am still here   tonight i just found out that the girl who i ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me   and yes she knows he raped me  she is very aware of the fact   it turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault   and they are now engaged  she s somehow kept it a secret from me  i ve moved away for college so we don t see each other every day like we used to  but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so i saw a post of the two of them together in facebook   this is the girl who calls me her sister  says she loves me more than anyone  tells me she ll always be there for me    so it hit me tonight  no one actually fucking cares about me  clearly not  the person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life   i feel like it s      all over again  i feel like all progress i ve made is lost and i m back right where i was  i don t want to wake up tomorrow morning  i don t know how to pretend everything s fine anymore   ,1
update i told my mom if you look on my profile you ll see my post earlier on this sub about being suicidal  it finally overpowered me and i told my mom  she told me that she loves me and that i m gonna be happy again  we might go to a therapist soon   i m also still talking to that girl and we re both getting closer and dealing with this fucked up world together  thanks so much for your advice guys  you saved my fucking life  i love you guys and i m trying to love life again  ,1
i wish they allowed people to donate their hearts when alive  it is a good way to have a painless death while also helping the people in desperate need of one   ,1
death isnt the worst thing  waking up and realizing youre constantly in pain is  cant even find the motivation to do anything anymore because my brain tries to pretend everything is alright  that stupid piece of shit  i have to make myself feel like crap in order to try and get anything done  i dont want to feel pain anymore  ive always told myself id make it out of this  that id live an enjoyable life after all  but i realize nothing is set in stone   ,1
its so much harder to kill yourself than they make it seem  or maybe im just not trying hard enough   i dont want to do this anymore  ,1
my wifes boyfriend told me to kill myself my wife left me in september after   years of marriage  this last saturday  i received a phone call from my wifes number  when i picked up  there was a mans voice on the other end  the first question he asked was why i hadnt already killed myself  i was taken aback at first  then he kept convincing me to do it  with my wife laughing in the background  he kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if i did so  he told me my sons wanted me to do it as well  i havent seen them since september  they are only   and    he said they were his kids now  which made me angry and extremely upset because i am over     miles away from them  on sunday  november   th  i attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication  before i was fully unconscious  my sister stopped by because she hadnt heard from me in over a day  when i came to  i was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck  one pumping the contents of my stomach out  while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream  after spending    hours in the icu  im home  i have an appointment on the   nd of november with a therapist and a doctor  but i dont think thats soon enough  im scared  and ashamed  and i feel even more alone  i miss my wife and my children dearly  which makes this so difficult to comprehend  i still cant believe that someone could say that to another human being  it cut deeper than any wound i could possibly imagine  ,1
ill just leave this here for you all   think about it   ,1
when i die dont you dare come to my grave and tell me you love me  because those words were the only thing that i needed to stay  ,1
monday again tomorrow  another week of anxiety and pain  everyday on the way home from work i wish i was dead  like id rather die than deal with the stress and anxiety of having to work and live in todays society  i would rather die than have to attend meetings  work  and feel incompetent for the rest of my life  i feel so stupid and inferior to everyone  like i cant even remember basic things and have to ask questions all the time    every day is painful  suffering  im crippled by anxiety and i dont know how much longer i can go on like this  cant quit cuz i need money  but seriously debating dying  wish i was dead  ,1
my life does not matter billions of people on this earth  not every single fucking life matters and is precious and sacred and important  i am fucking scum and a drain on resources that could be used to help productve  happy people  stop telling me my life matters there are millions that could die and humanity would just keep on leeching off this planet and its beauty  fuck us all  ,1
why is it so fucking difficult to die  i never wanted to exist  i want to die  there isnt anything in this world thats going to change my mind  i dont want to get better  my mental and physical illness might actually be curable but i dont want to get better  i never enjoyed life and the only reason i am alive is simply due to my parents selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me  i never asked to be born and no  life isnt a gift  life is pain  misery and dread   i am too much of a coward man  i tried to take my life once but didnt do any research on my method so obviously  as you can see  i failed tremendously  i took a bunch of xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping theyll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing   a simple google search wouldve saved me some time  because you need huge amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die   yet i went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it   i woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit  i wish i had the courage to attempt it again  in a different way  but im too much of a pussy  that failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that im such a failure that i cant even kill myself  ive been researching suicide methods ever since  but i just cant bring myself to do it  yet i somehow will  i need to    nbsp   looked up every single suicide method  most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable  others  will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and i just dont have the guts to go for it  i am a huge coward  who knows  maybe im just not ready to kill myself yet  as much as i want it    possibly   jumping in front of a train  nope  theres a chance of living through it and suffering     times more  jumping off a building  literally same  if youre unlucky  you can jump off a skyscraper and survive  theres an actual story of some dude who fell off a    floor building and survived   shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since i live in a shithole of a country in eastern europe  its nearly impossible for me to get a gun  im currently doing some research on hanging since its the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and ive read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly  but if you miscalculate  you will either end up decapitated or youll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you    minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging  overdosing on pills  i cant think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you   so what am i left with  oh yes  opiates  good old heroin  theres stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ods and said that it was absolute bliss  you just go in a deep sleep and  hopefully  dont wake up  no hallucinations or paranoia or shit that youd experience with other types of drugs  just peace      nbsp   so i started to look for a heroin plug in my area  its not easy living in a small city because youre out of luck  at some point  i was so desperate that i stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and i just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area  i was met with surprised reactions  some were weirded out  some were concerned  luckily  im not in prison so lucky me i guess  would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something  long story short  i couldnt find a dealer for the love of me  so here i am  browsing the darknet   it took me a few weeks to learn the ropes  theres special software like tails  tor  pgp kleopatra  and the bitcoin wallet of choice  still  no one will actually guarantee that you dont get scammed  im still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that i wont get in trouble  it fucking sucks  i just want to die and i cant understand all the unnecessary struggle i need to undergo  i wish it were as simple as going to the hospital  signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot  yet  only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows  i didnt choose to come into this life so why am i forced to stay   i cant find anyone who is willing to fucking help  i have tried reaching out online  both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback ive received was from people who  want me to get better   why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life  why does everyone care about a random strangers death so much  i dont want to live  is it a crime to hate life  it certainly seems so    nbsp   theres so much stuff im going to risk  i thing i have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback  im going to order from him as soon as i figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency  i might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door  who knows  maybe my pack will get seized  i might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws  even if i do get my hands on heroin  i know nothing about it  i dont know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation  can you freaking believe it  youre trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm  amazing  i know nothing about how to cook the heroin  how to shoot it up and how much to take  i know nothing about the purity of heroin and i might end up with some shit grade heroin that isnt going to kill me anyway  theres no fucking way to die peacefully  but anyway  ill go through this  not sure why i even wrote this  just needed to vent i guess    nbsp   wish me luck  ,1
i will forever resent everyone who told me it gets better  i will forever resent those who told me to wait because i was young  because  it gets so much better once youre done with school    i will forever have deep hatred for those who told me to just go to therapy  get on meds  get professional help  idk how the fuck it could ever help anyone but sure as the blood on the crucible it never helped me   i fucking hate empty platitudes   i fucking hate false promises   it doesnt get better  and im far too weak  tired and lonely to keep pretending that it will   fuck you  ,1
someone help me  tbh i kinda feel very sorry for myself  idk why i just don t believe it tbh  until the end of the day i said today s my birthday to someone else and everyone then said happy birthday but it s worthless to me now  i got surprised with cake and some gift cards but they personally didn t make me happy  yes i was happy but it just   idk just made me feel worthless sometimes  i got a reason why   i ve done some bad in my life and they accept me for that they don t accept me as a friend they only accept me as a weirdo and a annoying loser  i ll accept my fate and be a statistic after all  i have ambitions that are not good and aren t that ambitious at all    so yeah i need motivation and training     ,1
life feels like perpetual homework i dont give a shit about and dont want to finish  but i am forcing myself to care about it for some reason  do you relate   ,1
 killing yourself is selfish  you mightve heard this when mentioning suicide to somebody  or talking about it  maybe you even said it to someone else if youre not suicidal  ill make this clear  its fucking rude  seriously  what is insulting a suicidal person gonna do  ill tell you what it wont do  it wont pull them away from the edge  i had a friend who was at the bottom point  where they could hardly do anything  and they spent   months in a hospital due to brain damage from asphyxiation  and even longer in a different hospital while they took medicine and rehabilitation courses  i asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it  and they said  i kept hearing how selfish i was being  and i hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more  i only pulled back when they stopped saying that   a doctor  told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue  and i felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did  and he knew it wasnt selfishness to me     he went on for a while  i wish i took more of it to heart though  maybe i wouldnt feel so bad  ,1
anyone else feeling like they never truly connect with anyone  like youre so distanced and can never truly be there  not just in relationships but with everything as whole  feel really truly alone  even if i have friends i still feel alone   ,1
anyone else just want to sleep and never wake up  im tired  ,1
it is likely that i ll lose my husband to suicide  we ve been married    years and have   kids  he attempted suicide once  before we met  i should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby  he s been honest since we met about his mental health and i knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him  but i was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered   fast forward to present  my husband works in mental and behavioral health  he is very successful  constant stream of referrals to see him  he wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in  we ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years  this past fall was the worst  he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job  he was really down for a few months   finally we tried a ketamine infusion series which worked really well  but slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back  we tried a ketamine treatment yesterday  but it hasn t helped much  he told me last night that he s done fighting  life is just too hard   i felt like in the fall i had started preparing myself for the fact that i might lose him  i was seeing a great therapist at the time  and she really helped me  but right now we dont have health insurance and financially can t afford therapy   no one else really knows the extent of his depression  i feel selfish wanting him to stay  because i know he s hurting so much  and so tired of fighting  i want peace for him no matter what that means  however the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family  emotionally  and financially  and i have to think about those things because i will be responsible for all the pieces  and helping our kids navigate life without their dad  and i cannot imagine life without my soul mate  i don t know what to do or say anymore   i feel so scared and alone      thank you so much for all of your kind words  and support  this is my first post and first i thought it didn t work  but it was therapeutic to write down how i was feeling    i know it sounds like i m giving up  but truly i will fight with him as long as he wants  he knows this  he also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as  depression mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease   in my opinion    so i m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me    that said  i will never regret choosing him  everyone has struggles  and depression has been the biggest one we ve fought together  working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances  he s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others    and we have a beautiful family  we have kids who understand how their brains work  and how to be compassionate  they know that their feelings and the feelings of others  no matter what they are are  valid  my kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have  my husband has taught us all so many things  i am a better person  and parent because of him  and this won t change regardless of when his battle ends    and for those who haven t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life  just know i hear you  keep talking to your loved ones  it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you ve never felt that way yourself  but i am proof  it s possible  ,1
why is there no euthanasia for depressed people  it seems crazy to me that you can t opt for assisted suicide if you re depressed  even if there was a mandatory period of therapy or anti depressants etc before  at one point there s just little that seems worth trying  and it doesn t seem fair to try and force people to live   life is just shitty for some of us   i get that the idea is a suicidal person could always get better  but then lots of people don t recover  and lots of people then have to take it into their own hands   sure there s a lucky few who achieve a peaceful death   but then what about everyone who spends their final moments suffering  or those who are permanently damaged from botched suicide attempts   i think the most peaceful method of death in my country would have to be gas  but then one simple mistake and you re brain damaged for the rest of your life  incapable of doing anything to take control of your life anymore   it s       where is my suicide booth   ,1
biggest lesson ive learned so far in life  most people enjoy seeing you fail  and will not hesitate to kick you when youre down   ,1
i actually wish i had the balls to kill myself i have absolutely nothing to live for  i got no clear career goals and im doing horrible at university im convinced that life is horrible and i cant see anything positive about it  i tried cbt and it isnt doing anything  i just cant see anything in life thats worth all this pain  the struggle and the fight  life is so meaningless to me and its really unbearable i feel empty most of the time and i get suicidal thoughts every day but all these methods are quite scary to me  i find it quite sad that the only thing thats stopping me from ending it all is my coward personality not because i feel loved or worth it or like i have something to fight for if i was brave i would have been gone since i was    years old ,1
i dont want to commit suicide  but its almost all i think about  okay   want  is the wrong word   cant  fits better   i  cant  kill myself because of what it would do to my family  how it would tear everything apart  i cant do that to them    i need help  i dont want to feel like this anymore  i want to get better  i want to go back to how it used to be  i  just cant do this anymore   please please someone help me  i cant keep feeling like this  ,1
what are you realistically supposed to do  i fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option    option      tell a person you trust  maybe your friend     problem      you place a huge burden on them now to  keep you alive  and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead  they may tell people that you don t want to know  you don t want to stay alive no matter what  you want to feel better  and being betrayed doesn t make anything better     problem      telling someone means you re not actually serious about killing yourself   the only truly suicidal people are already dead      problem      telling someone is manipulative and harmful to  them   abusive  if a friend leaving will tip you over the edge  you can t  tell  them that  it s not their fault you feel suicidal without them      problem      you can t  get help  all by yourself  but you can t tell anyone else either  and professional help is a long  sometimes expensive process  like hell i want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will  let alone without the support of a trusted friend  i just want to be better     problem      the reason you re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts   the past  the present  the future  it s not just because of one breakup  or an unpleasant family life  or a toxic relationship  or possible mental health issues  or an existential crisis about your faith  it s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you  even if you desperately want one to     problem      nothing changes  except that now you ve hurt and burdened more people  you ve damaged relationships  and you feel the same if not worse than before     solution      you don t tell anyone  in part to not burden or hurt anyone  in part to be taken seriously  i  am  suicidal  and if i need to prove it then so be it      solution      you commit suicide  people get hurt  but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had  after all  in the end the problem was your existence  not all problems have solutions  minimize damage by acting now  rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you  ,1
why do others get to decide if we have to live or not  let me die  why are we forced to stay alive  why do others go out of their way sooo much to pretend they care by setting up acts like the unusable hotlines and expensive therapists    if i want to die and literally end it all  that should be my choice  i am a burden and i am reminded of that every single day  just let me go  why does it have to be about you and your potential grief  i am obviously lacking resources and suffering from a life long illness that will never get better  so why should i continue to suffer  so you dont have to pay for a funeral  that shouldnt even be a thing anyway    i also wish overdosing was easier  ,1
does anyone else admire the people that actually kill their selfs  i want to so bad but i m a huge pussy  but i really do admire people who have the guts too do it like kurt cobain or anthony bourdane  ,1
told my partner im suicidal he took it well  he didnt act like im the burden i feel like  he said wed get me help    i expected abandonment  i expected dismissal  instead i got love and support  it would probably feel good  if i could feel anything right now   if you are also suffering  i hope you find something similar to help you through the tough times ,1
i say  i wanna fucking die  to myself out loud at least    times a day  i have an appointment with a psychiatrist on the   th but i dont know if i can make it that long  ,1

i  get better  and then fucking what  i wont magically morph into an optimist  im not going to forget that everything is futile and that everyone i know and love has an expiration date  who the fucking hell cares about their own potential and personal fulfillment when it all gets funneled back into the ground   whats the fucking point of being alive  so i can watch people and animals suffer and die for no fucking reason  so i can suffer for no fucking reason  sure some motherfuckers coast through life  but that doesnt candycoat or erase the fact that heinous shit happens everywhere  every second of every fucking day  and there are no ultimate consequences  innocent children  women  and men will face unimaginable cruelty just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and nothing happens to a tenth of the cocksuckers who perpetrate evil  i cant fucking do anything about it  those who can would rather stick their thumb up their ass   everyone fucking hates each other  nation against nation  ideology against ideology  generation against generation  gender against gender  were programmed to manufacture some way to be at odds with each other at all times  unhappiness and discontent is our evolutionary imperative  this will never end   life requires a certain degree of numbness to the truth in order to operate  being this sober about reality is debilitating  whatever happiness i can invent pales in comparison to what is  no amount of cognitive behavioral therapy  no pill  no electric current through my skull will ever make me forget this  i am millions of miles beyond the point where i can take a little ignorance with my bliss  i cant be comfortable while knowing pain and suffering are taking place all around me  i dont want to be a part of this anymore   im not the one that needs to get better  ,1
suicide is a good plan   think about it alive  learn how to be an adult  learn how to be polite even when angry  develop a dependency on substances  figure out a way to be sober  find someone who will love you and put up with their shit the rest of your life  and everyone has to   be a parent who doesn t pass this suicide tendency down to your kids so you suppress it  causing a worse situation i imagine   and i haven t even started on the political climate  everyone is racist if they even dare support trump publicly  i am not a trump supporter but i find it odd nobody is allowed to agree with any single thing he has done or is doing without being raked over the coals  this is only an example  and covid      suicide   i m dead  i can t hurt anyone anymore  i won t yell at my kids anymore  i won t fight with my wife anymore  i don t need to go to work anymore  my political opinion won t matter and covid can t hurt me   seems pretty open and shut to me  i know you re all having these thoughts too  life is hard and it s too hard to live for it anymore  ,1
depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home  but no matter where i am  i am never home  even when i m at my physical home  it s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else  i d feel better if i was at this place  then you go there and then it s the same exact feeling  just in a different physical location    i feel mentally homeless and i just want to go home    edit  i didn t think this would get traction and that s my first gold  thanks buddy  ,1
depression is so much worse if you live with your parents  i cant hide  i cant cry out loud  they dont understand me if i cant clean my room or cant go out  they watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens  ,1
shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression  this is me  don t get me wrong  it s better than don t leave my bed for a week depression  i am grateful i can be an independent person  but there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day  occasionally clean up after yourself  pay your bills  generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being    but that s it  nothing else  no social life  no hobbies  constantly battling your mind  and being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time  ,1
a stranger just saved my life    i woke up today wanting to die  i was planning on doing it after school so i decided school was pointless to go to  i walked to the mall by my school and went to a kneaders and ordered french toast  french toast has always been my favorite so i figured it would be a good last thing to eat  i pondered a ton about my life and what it is i really want  i felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts  i had convinced myself i needed to finish my life today  i had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate  he said that he ordered it for me because he could tell i needed it  he told me  i dont know what youre going through  but life will get better   and then he left  and then i cried  and now im back at school  and i think i want to live    edit  thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind      ,1
i was going to kill myself tonight i wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning  i spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy  getting coffee  walking in the park  listening to music  etc  i ate my  last meal  while listening to bob marley   about an hour before i was going to kill myself  my friend from college messaged me and asked to play xbox  we ended up reminiscing on good times  and laughing our asses off  it felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me  we re planning on playing tomorrow too   i don t feel as bad as i did earlier today and i also am glad that i didn t kill myself   edit  thank you for the gold  friend    edit  thank you for the silver  friend   i m currently sitting at a coffee shop  reading all the kind messages everyone has sent  it means a lot to me ,1
does anyone ever feel okay for a while  then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck  recently i thought i was beginning to feel better  not quite happy  but just sort of    i don t know  content  but my depression always seems to come back  sometimes stronger than others  this has happened in the past too  i m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i m hanging onto will snap  or maybe not  that could just be the apathy speaking though  anybody else really frustrated by this  it feels like i m always walking a razors edge between being fine  and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance  ugh    edit  evidently  there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings  i just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives  it makes things less lonely  ,1
the worst thing is realising no one is coming to save you and you have to rescue yourself with zero motivation to do so  i imagine these ridiculous scenarios in which i somehow get saved from my depression by others  like an intervention where someone comes and tries to save me     but now my mind is clear  no one is coming to save me  it is up to us     but how can you mend yourself when all you want to do is destroy yourself  ,1
living with depression is like running a marathon with a broken leg and then having everyone run past you and say  yeah  yeah  broken leg boo hoo  we re all tired   and then run the same fucking race everyday  the cycle  you re depressed   you re okay  it ll take time  but you re okay   what the hell is taking so long  life blows  you re depressed again   you woke up and got dressed today  it s looking up from here   sike  you fucking idiot  did you truly believe your depression was done with you  you re dumber than you lead yourself to believe   okay  we re okay  we re gonna make it  i just gotta stay strong   oop  you fucked up once today  i m dragging your ass back into the dark    over and over and over    is there really only one way out  i don t know if i wanna die  i got a brother who may need me one day  i m tired  so tired  man  ,1
if    years ago someone told me that in    years i would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat  sleep and use my phone pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks  i would never believe them but here i am     years old man and doing exactly that  ,1
do any of you feel like youre lying or being melodramatic every time you try to talk about your mental health  i think i may have depression  but i find it so hard to talk about  because every time i try i feel like i am just making something out of nothing  i can write out   messages to a friend but never send them because everything i write feels like a lie   i managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now  then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like i was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them  they were so supportive but i shut it down  now i feel even more like i am just being melodramatic or attention seeking  ,1
does anyone else feel normal one minute then wish you were dead the next  i feel decent  im watching youtube or im just browsing the internet and all of a sudden my mind is like   everything in life requires effort and im way too exhausted to try  i have a long life ahead of me but its too much of a bother  i dont want to live    even if im feeling optimistic about my future and   what if everything really does work out the way i want it to   i feel like its way too tiring to live the life i want and all i want is to sleep and do nothing   everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and i dont want to do it  i think if i knew that i would inevitably drop dead in    years then i would feel a bit more motivated  but just knowing that its likely that ill have to wait    more fucking years before i might finally drop dead is like a giant weight on my shoulders  ,1
high functioning depression  i feel like im living a double life  i read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily  debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives  making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower  i feel that i am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible   from an outsiders perspective  i appear to be a very happy and stable individual  i have a financially secure job and i go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day  my coworkers like me  and some look up to me  no one would think i have any problems at all  however  i feel like i am hidden behind a veil  and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home  i am in such crippling depression  i have such terrible episodes of sadness  i hate myself  i over analyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself  i dont feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely dont know why anyone even likes me  and yet i still get up every day  live this routine  and put on a facade like i am okay  it feels like i am living a double life that i cannot escape  ,1
 depression isnt always at  am when youre alone with only the thoughts in your head  sometimes its at  pm  when youre surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing   this is high functioning depression  so many people dont get it  i look normal on the outside  but thats because i try very hard to  ,1

does anyone else get extremely bummed out seeing people younger than them doing more with their life  i hate being told   itll get better when youre older   no it fucking wont  ive waited for over a decade for things to get better   they havent  its especially not true when i see people younger than me living better  happier    more interesting lives  clearly that means im a failure   i just cant properly do this game we call life   just today someone i know whos younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their so  i cant do that now   if that doesnt scream that im a pathetic loser  i dont know what does  ,1
i want to be alone  but not lonely  i want friends but hate socializing  want success  but have no desire to be productive  i m lost in my own conscience  thank you all for the supportive messages  it s heartwarming to know that i m not alone  i know we can all get through this together  i love each and every single one of you  ,1
does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day  i don t know if that makes sense  what i mean is that i stay up as late as possible wasting time because i know that if i go to sleep  i ll wake up and have to go to school  i usually go to bed at around     am and get up at  am and it s destroying me  i ve been doing this for months and i m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it  and they always seem to get their way    edit  i m really glad that this spoke to so many people  it feels good knowing i m not alone  sending lots of love to you all  this isn t easy but i believe in you    ,1

my therapist died she was only     she told me every so often about how she always thought shed end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end  i dont know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt   im extremely shaken up  but i think she wouldnt want me to be sad for her   in her memory im going to tell the people i love how i feel  give my dog a hug  and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when i feel like nobody else is   edit  thanks everyone for your kind words  i feel less alone about this now  in lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dogs vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover  maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further ,1
does anyone else have a constant feeling of not fitting in or belonging anywhere  i feel this way around everyone  friends  family  coworkers  anywhere i go  i just always feel like i m in the background  but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don t have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight   ,1
the scary part about having depression is when you start to feel down its hard to know if its a temporary reaction to life or the start of a relapse basically what the title says and my current situation  ,1
the worst part of depression is waking up and the first thought that pops in your head is how shitty you feel  alone and already struggling to get through the day before it s even started  i can t even remember the last time i woke up excited for anything   edit  wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and sharing your own stories  definitely glad to have this community it helps to know we aren t alone even though it may feel that way  ,1
do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever youre doing and feel a great wave of existential dread self hatred happens to me a lot  cooking  walking to class  brushing my teeth   sometimes i just stop for like a minute  feel a tremendous sense of self hatred and suicidal ideation  and then continue on as if nothing ever happened  ,1

it sucks realizing youre no ones best friend i mean  its not their fault  i cant really be mad at other people for having better connections with another person  i just wish i had someone i could call my best friend  and have them do the same    ,1
is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning  i know that the fact that i can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression  but i m also sick of constantly feeling like i m about to break  i hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work  each night i think to myself i can t go on like this and each day i do  part of me just somehow wishes i completely gave up and just hit rock bottom  i don t know  anyone else feel the same  ,1
becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life i was depressed  failing school  etc and i decided i should do my homework at a coffee shop one day  i went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if i wanted to join the rewards program and i was really craving community at this point and i was super excited   i kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me  i started to get to know everybody there very well and now i consider them all friends   i found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot  and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses   a two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have ,1
to people who say  you can always talk to me  no i fucking cant  you really think i can just drop  i want to kill myself and have for   years  on someone at   am and expect it to go over well  im not about to put that on anyone ,1
people that arent depressed exist and its fuckin insane to me  like       i posted on askreddit asking non depressed people how they felt and im shocked  not sure what i expected though    you exist in this hellhole and youre just like    chill with it  like im so happy for these people but its mindblowing  like i have never known a time that i didnt experience severe recurring depression so its just fuckin crazy that these people are real  one even said they dont understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason  like i wish so much i could say the same    like logically i knew they must exist but its still just unfathomable in my mind  it kinda makes me sad that i dont understand them just as much as they dont understand me  but im glad at least someone is happy in life  idk man  ,1

anyone keep switching from admitting to yourself that you have depression to invalidating yourself into thinking you were just playing victim  i know i have issues  but i go through manic mood swings  and while on the depressive end i feel like absolute shit  when im out of that phase and feel somewhat  normal  again i tell myself i greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind  it doesnt help that my self loathing wont let me admit that i have depression because i keep thinking i dont deserve to be depressed  so i invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits  and the cycle continues  ,1

the worst part of depression is that its stolen my personality my actual personality is over the top  fun in my opinion   confident  and kind  but the depression teams up with social anxiety so that i just dont have enough enough energy to act like who i truly am  i turn into this very flat  monotone  boring  quiet person who i would never want to hang out with or date   its the main reason i avoid social interaction now   it feels humiliating because i feel like im perceived as this pathetic  pitiable  ignorable person    when im feeling better and have a little more energy i can act like myself but usually im just this shell  its horrible  like watching the progression of als in a loved one  they just slowly fade away until theres nothing left of who they used to be  at least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself  that fundamental spark of who you truly are  and youre able to show that and share that with others  i dont even have that privilege    sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive  this is just how i feel   edit  guys  thanks so much for all the responses  i appreciate all of you  i didnt know so many people felt the same way  and im glad if i was able to help give voice to your struggles  ive had depression my whole life so ive had a lot of time to think about these things  i think it helps to be able to really narrow down what youre feeling  i wish you all luck in getting better  ,1
i can overhear my mother on the phone laughing and joking about my depression to her friend saying things like  she s so emotional hahaha  and telling her friend everything i just said that was making me upset   everything about me is just a joke to her  just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over   i don t even know why i m crying  what else should i expect from someone who hasn t ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support  ,1
imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it  thats what getting help for depression looks like to me  im discouraged today   d   edit  this is a bit overwhelming  but reading all your comments was lovely  i hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day  i guess we can run this marathon together if thats what it should come for  you lean on me so your broken leg doesnt hurt as much  and ill lean on the second person  etc  have a wonderful day    ,1
we only wish depression was being  sad   but depression is much more than that    it s the excuses you have to make when you can t make that meeting    it s the friends and family you ve lost because you can t explain why    it s the opportunities that land in everyone else s lap  that they get to grasp with both hands  while yours slip out of your grasp    it s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed    it s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself  towards the world for being the way it is    it s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better  except for you    it s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind    it s the ball and chain locked around your neck  choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon  while everyone else gets to charge on ahead  unimpeded    it s the wall that blocked you off from life    its the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories    it s not just being  sad   and we can only wish it was     edited to add  thank you all for the kind words and awards  i really didnt expect this to blow up as much as it did  i wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words  and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like  for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isnt real or otherwise downplay it   ,1
after i revealed i ve had depression for a very long time  a co worker told me today that i am the most positive and uplifting person at the office to talk to but she d known something was wrong because of my eyes   your face lights up  your smile is infectious  but your eyes always look like you re staring at a freight train while you re standing on the tracks in front of it    man if that didn t fuck my shit up for the rest of the day ,1
trying to lose weight while being depressed suicidal is weird because it s like who am i getting skinny for  the embalmers   idk where else to put this ,1
why does no one ever speak about the major memory loss that comes with depression   i havent been on this sub before so idk if its discussed here more often or if it even happens to everyone but i have basically never heard of people talk about this aspect of depression  seriously  before i had depression i didnt have the slightest idea that it would effect your memory and every time i mention my fucked up memory people are always suprised  i cant think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life  i cant explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff ive said or done and i cant properly remember it myself   edit  everyone probably doesnt have this and its not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect  like some people have said it all just blurs together  i think it has something to do with how you dont really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them  i mean i cant remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so dont know whats that all about but its kind of a relief that im not alone with this   edit  it took me about    minutes  if not more  to read all of these comments  i didnt really read everyone all the way through or focuse on them but i tried to read them all  still thanks everyone and im glad this helped some people  ,1
it s not that i want to kill myself  but if i die i wouldn t be upset  i don t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn t mean i don t want to die  it d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone i love if something just happened to me and i died  i know it isn t right to think like this but i can t stop    edit  this blew up  it s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same   edit    thank you all so much for the words of encouragement  i m home now and would love to reply to all of them but i have to do homework  things will get better for all of us if there s this much support in the world  ,1
has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression  but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience  i found that a lot of times in the past i would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that i was already  trying  to do and then i panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session  it s hard to open up about it when i m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion  difficulty thinking and focusing  memory loss and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating         for not from depression  sorry ,1
i almost killed myself today i just broke down  that just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out  i sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if i should write anything  before i could do anything my cat came and jumped on me  he pressed his face to mine and i just snapped back  i m trying so hard to get better  i m glad my cat jumped on me  that sweet little guy saved me   edit  i want to thank everyone for their kind words  i didn t expect to receive so much kindness  for those wondering  i am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management   to the few people who said hurtful things  my story may be  cliche and boring  but it s still my fucking life  it s my experience  i can t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you  it wouldn t be real then  to those who told me to try again and that i m a failure  you don t have to tell me that  i know but i ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life  ,1
when i m sitting on my ass doing nothing  i feel useless and depressed  when i m actually doing something  i think about how i d rather be just relaxing at home just a loop of unhappiness  really hope i can fix it soon   i wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life  ,1

im black  im scared  tired and im at the end of my rope with life  jesus  how do i even start  as you could read by the title  im a black man  ive always been in the fight  grew up with racism in all its forms in my country  which  ironically  usually denies there ever being racism in any way   the kind of shit ive heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self esteem  sense of self worth  voice and made into introvert  because of the mentality of  you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there   i always saw the future as bleak  tiresome and as more struggle  this never really changed  it just got worse with time  with college and the awful reality that came afterwards   ive been depressed for most of my life  with my initial diagnosis at age    i still have it  with severe anxiety  my first suicidal thoughts came at age    and then and there i already hated myself for everything  for not being enough  for not being what the world wanted  for failing myself at being the best  for never getting anything good out of my own life  for never letting myself rest or be human   and with all the recent events  like the absurd police brutality worldwide  the rise of authoritarianism in my country  with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic  with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid    and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened  which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine    all of this shit  is just wearing me down really badly   i wake up exhausted  i cant deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts  followed by fullscale breakdowns  im feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom  i feel guilty by feeling tired  by feeling afraid  i feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action  i feel guilty for existing  im so fucking exhausted and i dont know what to do  i just want it all to end  i just wanna go somewhere else  i cant handle anything anymore   edit  all of this support    im very  very thankful for it  i think ive never felt this supported in my whole life  all of your words have touched me deeply  im so glad you helped me  i feel more hopeful  more energized from talking to you all  thank you  thank you all  from the bottom of my heart  youve all stopped me from doing something terrible today  thank you   edit    wow  i was not expecting this kind of response from so many people  im trying to respond to everyone  but i think i cant  id like to thank you all once more for all your words  im very glad that i vented about all these feelings here with you all  i feel so much support from you and i feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling  it may seem a bit dramatic  but im legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life  i never expected to see so many people i dont know just rush in to support me when im in my absolute worst  so thank you  once more for being here for me  i mean it  i love you all ,1
do you ever feel that the deeper in depression you are  the dumber you become  today i was feeling extremely low  i dont know but my i feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased  im just so angry and irritable  i hate this feeling ,1
i feel like i m addicted to depression  whenever i feel sad i don t try to cheer up i try to make myself sadder because i like it more  i feel addicted to isolating myself from others and there s a small part of me that enjoys feeling depressed and isolated  depression feels strangely comforting at times  does anyone else have this issue  ,1
i fucking hate dreams that make you feel love and make you feel happy they just give you a taste of what you ll never have and when your self esteem is at an all time low it just makes you want to kill yourself even more ,1
the worst thing about depression is seeing everyone around you progress in their life and you are stuck in the same place its like when you are playing videogame and you get stuck on some part of mission while others are having fun you are having the worst time in ur entire life ,1
does anybody else ever stay up late so they can avoid tomorrow   ,1
a depressed persons vocabulary  im fine   im okay   nah im just tired   its not a big deal   what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad  or when your being moody because your sad  ,1
when i don t have a job  i want a job  when i have a job  i don t want a job  when it s hot  i want it to be cold  when it s fucking cold  i want it to be hot  when i m myself i want to be with people  when i m with people i want to be by myself do you guys see what i m saying here  i m always constantly completely bullshitting myself       i always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then i get them and i want the opposite  complete self destruction and all  ,1
an unexpected side effect of depression  the decline of cognitive capabilities this has been really scaring me lately  since becoming depressed ive noticed more and more     an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people    severely reduced attention span    short term memory loss    severely reduced motivation  i think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism  as i spend much more time browsing reddit youtube and getting high since when i actually try to focus on work i usually end up crying  the result seems to be a feeling like ive been living in a haze  like im never really fully aware of whats going on  im just passively going through the motions of life    getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than i thought  i literally feel stupider now that ive been depressed for months  i can barely even talk to people in my classes now  they seem so competent and on top of things while im just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence  ,1
it s so weird how parents swear they know you better than you know yourself but can t see when you re not happy it s been so bad lately  my sleep schedule is completely fucked  the lower left corner of my bed is full of trash and i can t toss and turn in my bed without feeling a crumb  i don t leave my room unless it s to get food or see my mom because she works from home all day  i haven t changed clothes in a week  at least i m showering and brushing my teeth and stuff  that s become a habit ever since i got two cavities from not doing so in a month  it s like i don t want to talk about it because i hate talking about it  i just want to go to the doctor get a therapist or some shit and never talk to my family about anything like it  because i ve still got doubts whether i have depression or i m just lazy and a shitty person  ,1
too depressed to be productive  and not depressed enough to kill myself i lowkey wish i can be pushed over the edge so ill have the courage to end it all  as horrible as that sounds  ,1
i hope being dead is like sleeping because im tired i really am i just want to sleep forever and never wake up again  ,1
i feel like im getting stupider  less talented  clumsier  and that soon i will be completely retarded  as the title says  i feel like im getting worse and worse at everything  i feel like im getting weaker  much much dumber  i used to know a shit ton of trivia  a lot of history and be really good at helping people out  now ive forgotten most things unless i read up on it daily  ive been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and ive become completely socially unaware   things that used to be easy are now difficult  i constantly make typos and i cant even concentrate on things i like  much less things i dislike   anyone else feel like that  ,1
i sleep all day because it s the closest thing i can get to not existing i m too cowardly and afraid of pain to commit suicide but i just don t want to exist  ,1

anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare it makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again weird post lol sorry ,1
i don t live for myself anymore  i only live so my mom doesn t have to go through the pain of me committing suicide i wonder how much longer i can continue like this ,1
i dont wanna kill myself  i just dont wanna wake up anymore  idk if that makes sense  but i dont want to kill myself  i really dont  i want to be killed  i want to be shot or to not wake up  i dont want to make the choice to kill myself because my friends and family will feel responsible but i want to die  ,1
today i woke up and didn t want to die  after bordering on suicidal yesterday  i was surprised to find i had the motivation to get out of bed when i woke up this morning  the first thing i did was make my bed  and that s a victory in my book    i love you all   edit  thank you for the silver  and for the heartwarming comments  it means a lot   edit    this has me all kinds of emotional  i ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers  ,1
fun fact  when i was younger many people told me i was a gifted child of above average intelligence  well i sure showed them  didnt i   im a massive fuckup  i forget things the minute after i am told them  theres just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head  my grammar has devolved into caveman speak   i dunno if i blame my mental health or if im just stupid  ,1
anyone else barely hanging on to life with no motivation whatsoever  too much of a coward to kill myself  but at the same time have no reason to live  i just need to know that i m not alone who feels like this in this hour  ,1
anybody feel like you died long ago  and youre just a zombified shell  i just go through the routine every day  and kinda let everything just pass by  i dont really have much of an emotional response to anything  and my personality feels like a mush of stuff  like  whenever things go wrong  people say they want to die  and while  yeah  i dont like what happened  i just feel kinda    neutral  ,1
is anyone else hating the fact that they re wasting time of their life as you re witnessing it all go in the drain because of their stupid mental illness holding you down  it s so stressful  there s so many things i want to do but i just can t at the moment and it sucks  theoretically  i could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if i wasn t paralyzed and living my regular depressed life  watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you ve kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me  ,1
do you ever get so empty you re excited when you finally start crying because at least you re feeling an emotion  i ve felt empty for days and just now cried a little  even though i m miserable i was almost happy  it s worse to feel like you re dead than being sad  ,1
mom died last night going to be needing all your love and support  my depression has been doing so good  i m so proud  but my mom passed away last night of pulmonary veno occlusive disease  really needing positivity in these trying times  thank you so much    ,1
fuck u if u discriminate against people with trauma and mental illness you know how many people reject me and judge me for my mental illness trauma  guys will fucking play me  act all into me at first  and then flip the script and be like  oh srry this ain t gonna work out  u don t rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye   they don t say that literally but im trying to summarize lol  like wtf   you knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one  why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways  do you know how devastating and invalidating that is  that s like saying someone with a disability can t love someone because they re not  normal   tbh i think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets  since i m mental and i ve been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me  and are surprised when i stand up for myself and don t allow them to do that  well  screw you and fuck off   ,1
anyone else get super motivated at night to get your life together  then when its daytime that motivation is gone  i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day   ,1
anyone been depressed for so long they dont even know if they are depressed or if they are just really boring  i dont know if im depressed or if ive just lost my personality and identity  i dont know if this is me now or what   im nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it    years back dad said it was just a stage im going through  yet here i am  all my friends are still themselves im completely fucking different ,1

i m a christmas person  but this year i m just    empty  i ve felt better these past few months  a lot better  great even  but this christmas it s like    i can t bring myself to care for the holidays   and it s my favourite holiday  i can t explain it    my family lives two hours away and i almost didn t go  just because i wanted to be alone in my apartment  doing absolutely nothing  but i m a single child  my parents are single children  all my grandparents are dead   it s just us three  they re getting old  too  i couldn t just  not  go  they would have been so sad and i don t want that   but i m just empty and miserable and it s christmas so i have to put up a front  a nice dress and be nice   gosh this is hard   merry christmas   edit  wow  you guys know how to make someone feel special and a little less alone  thank you  kind strangers     ,1
the reality of depression  yesterday i was googling  most effective suicide methods   today i feel fine  this has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime  im    now  so obviously i havent succumbed to depression yet  but the peaks and valleys are insane  i guess  im  insane  yesterday it fully made sense to me   if i had had immediate means to end my life i could see taking that action  this is why i can never have a gun  or live in a tall building    so far that small voice in me that says  it will get better  just wait  has remained more powerful than the other larger  louder voice that says  youve always been alone  youll always be alone  life isnt worth the pain   my reality is having both of those voices in my brain  and feeling that both are absolutely real when theyre there  ,1
do you ever doubt the validity of your depression  and just think that the reason you can t do normal things  is just because you re a bad person  my depression has depression bro  a lot of the time i doubt that i have a mental illness  and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things  i feel empty all the time  yeah  i have a diagnosis  yeah  but i still manage to doubt myself anyways  it almost feels like it s normal to feel empty  it s strange when people tell me they can do their school work  have a job  and feel happy by second nature  it seems like feeling this way is normal  but i also feel like i m alone in this  it s weird  i tell myself things like   this isn t because of the depression  it s because you re worthless and incapable of doing anything   i tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing  but deep down i would give anything in the world to feel happiness   i hope this isn t just me  like deadass  i don t know if i m the only person who feels like this  and if i am that s just gonna scare me  ,1
my girlfriend cheated on me with one of my best friends while i was at the psych ward for trying to kill myself  someone please cheer me up so this happened about   months ago but i found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me  we had been dating just about a year and i genuinely loved her with all my heart  i trusted her so much and she knew i have severe depression  i cant understand how another human can be that shitty  anyone willing to talk    edit  just found out she cheated on me with another guy too  shes completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated  back to feeling terrible again  just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good    ,1
absolutely nothing interests me anymore  i fucking hate it  i literally don t want to do anything at all  it doesn t bring me any happiness or joy or whatever  at best  just distracts me from feeling shitty  absolutely nothing helps  video games  writing  reading  doing photography  drawing    none of that makes me happy   it s the absolute fucking worst  i don t even feel like sleeping  but i don t wanna be awake either  i go to bed before  pm because i have nothing else i wanna do  all i do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry  then i go to sleep  wake up and repeat   i hate living  i hate this existence  i wish i could just die in my sleep   edit  this got a lot more attention than i thought so i just wanna day that i m reading all your comments and i love you all ,1

i wish i could have just one single day where i dont feel like i need to work at being a person one day where i dont have to apologize for existing  one day where i can just exist instead of vowing to do better  to improve  to work harder  to be worthy  my whole life is a stupid apology  ,1
nobody gives a fucking shit about you until you mention killing yourself  this world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit  nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness  its blatantly obvious  fuck this   edit  this post isnt about me  its about other people  ,1
i shouldnt have to lie about my depression to get a sick day but i do  every time  because saying  i threw up everywhere last night  gets you a  oh sweetie  take the day off to rest  its okay    but saying  my depression is acting up really badly and i just cant do it today  gets you a  dont be lazy  everyone gets sad  suck it up and come into work     i shouldnt have to be fucking ashamed of my depression  its as medical as the flu  yet people seem to think mental illnesses arent a valid reason  and that youre not really sick   fuck that shit  we need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general  ,1
anyone else get lost in their daydreams and get hit with a wave of depression when you snap back to reality  i spend so much time thinking about how i wish my life was that i can t face the actuality of where i am  ,1
high functioning depression is so easily over looked i try and do anything and everything all day  i cant be alone with my thoughts so my objective is to do as much as i can to keep busy  every evening im exhausted  emotionally drained and still depressed  i feel like im beating back a relentless force  i feel like ive been robbed of being proud of the little things i do like washing my face or baking because i do that anyway so its not like i can be proud of the effort ive put in  my biggest fear is waking up and not having anything to do  just be in my head  fortunately im able eat  brush my teeth and do things every day and to the outsider i look like im doing really well but im struggling a lot  before this there was a year of staying in bed and not doing anything but now that im doing things everyday i feel even more hopeless  its proof that even if im proactive in my life i feel as shit as i would if i did fuck all  ,1
does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression  i always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and ive felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head  so many things piss me off  i sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger  its led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and i dont know why i push them away ,1
how many other people go to sleep wishing theyll die peacefully before they wake up  i read this a lot here   i dont want to kill myself  i just wish i didnt exist   i identify with that     so much  i just dont want to keep feeling like this anymore  and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as im trying to sleep  e g  right now   all i want is to simply not wake up tomorrow  is that so much to ask for   edit  wow  i did not expect to get so many responses when i wrote this yesterday  although sad  its still oddly comforting to know im not alone in feeling this way  so thank you sincerely for sharing  for those who offered helpful tidbits  thank you also  i hope that you all find peace one way or another  just as i hope that i can too  but lets face it  chances are thats wont be tonight  so     here we go again  ,1
i deleted my note  i had a long  very long suicide not stored in my phone  just waiting  and yesterday i deleted  it  i know it it s not a huge step  but i feel ultimately better   update  i didn t expect this to blow up  i posted it because i couldn t believe i had finally done it  and i had felt so good  i m trying to say thank you to everyone who commented  thank you to whoever gave me gold  you re the best  and you all are amazing  thank you   update    to everyone saying i inspired them to delete theirs  i cannot comprehend how good that made me feel that i helped to inspire you guys  i am so proud of every one of you  thank you for all the love and support  i m blown away and feel incredibly uplifted right now  ,1
sleeping is the only activity i dont hate because its like a free trial of not existing dreaming is also a bonus  sure the occasional nightmares are bad  but at least its better than being awake  where you feel bad      of the time  ,1
my friend attempted suicide a couple days ago  my family is saying i will  ruin christmas  if i spend time with her in the hospital on christmas eve instead of visiting them  what can i do  a good friend of mine with whom ive been attending therapy for bpd overdosed a couple days ago  she survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital  she woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated  i want to be there as her support  she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends  i had plans to see my family for christmas but when this happened  it left me deeply depressed  particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day  to elaborate  i dont like spending christmas with my family  i like them  but christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace    i thought i would spend christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital  i dont want her to be alone  i know that if i were in her situation i would appreciate it if someone came to visit me  so i proposed this to my mother and brother  even the possibility that i would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner  however  their comments left gasping for air  they showed little empathy for my friend or me  my mother asked me if i had any  normal  friends  my brother told me that while its ultimately my choice  i would be ruining christmas by not coming down  or even by coming down just for dinner  that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments  implying i would be at fault for them    heres the breakdown   with my family  i risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if i dont go down there  however  ive felt more and more like they were less and less my family  while ive felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and bpd than my family ever has   in fact  theyve dismissed it as me  not having enough social activity   as  not having enough will   and have called my therapy  a waste of time   i feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do  i know i will think of her the whole time i would be down at my familys  but i do not want to be ostrasized for months  i dont think i could handle it with my mental condition    any and all thoughts are welcome  thank you  ,1
i hate how fast i go from being okay to empty and depressed i was doing fine this past month  i ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once  i started talking to this girl and things were perfect  we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things  i haven t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time  yesterday i invited her to hang out with my friends and i and she was just so different than she is when we re alone  when i tried to hold her hand she didn t let me  afterwards she texted me and said she s not ready after all and realized it when i tried to show affection in front of my friends  we ve only been talking for about   weeks so it didn t completely destroy me  but i just always get attached quick so i m still upset about it  it seems like every person i see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and i m over it    being a front line worker is exhausting as it is  but having a failed  almost relationship  again is messing with my head and i m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when i ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that  it s hard when i put all my effort into people that don t do the same back  you know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life  i m starting to think i m the problem behind all these failed relationships  i know she s not worth it  i don t think it s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life  i don t know what to do anymore   tdlr  things were fine until they weren t and i just don t know what to do anymore ,1
why i stopped opening up   bottling emotions is extremely unhealthy  you know  you can talk to me about anything     dumps brain onto poor unsuspecting soul    wow  you should talk to a therapist about that  i believe in you though    edit  thanks for all the supportive comments  to those suggesting i not open up to people who dont get it  i completely agree  this has happened to me when opening up to people who used to be very close friends who dont really have the time for me anymore  im not just dumping my brain on anyone who asks  ,1
i feel like depression makes me more stupid like its harder for my brain to work   like im in the middle of a fog   i make stupid mistakes at work   i wonder if im mentally handicapped   i have thoughts of  what if im no longer mentally able to do my job   that scares me   edit   finally got back here and wow  did this take off   i went through every last one of your comments   im in a brain fog even as i write this so i dont have the right words but thank you for all your stories  support  advice  information and so much more   as much in pain as i am right now i am so grateful   because until now i was missing a huge understanding of my condition   a doctor once told me i was  living in a dark room    well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps  and possible permanent loss of function  that go along with this disease   so i hope you have had  a ha  moments about your condition too   so that we can all be on the way to recovery  like some have fortunately accomplished   ,1

our most broken and least understood rules is  helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort   so weve made a new wiki to explain it we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help  but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster   it usually works out quite differently here than when you say  pm me anytime  in a casual social context     we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content   even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves   were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here   this is just a small start     our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments  at least until youve gotten to know someone   it will be maintained at  r depression wiki private contact  and the full text of the current version is below             summary       anyone who  while acting as a helper  invites or accepts private contact  i e  pms  chat  or any kind of offsite communication  early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement   either way  its unwise to trust them        pm me anytime  seems like a kind and generous offer  and it might be perfectly well meaning  but  unless and until a solid rapport has been established  its just not a wise idea   here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately       by posting supportive replies publicly  youll help more people than just the op  if your responses are of good quality  youll educate and inspire other helpers     the        rule  https   en wikipedia org wiki      rule  internet culture    applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet       people who are struggling with serious mental health issues often  justifiably  have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high level of ever changing emotional need    unless the helper is able to make a      commitment to be there for them in every way  for as long as necessary  offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good    this is why mental health crisis line responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders   its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole   analogously  its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole   even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high intensity situations alone   its partly about availability  but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue        if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental health issues  including suicidality  which is often comorbid with depression  escalate  in a pm conversation its much harder for others  including the  r depression and  r suicidewatch moderators to help      contrary to common assumptions  moderators cant see or police pms        in our observation over many years  the people who say  pm me  the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental health issues and mental health support  we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively   community input mitigates these limitations    theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny     if helpers are concerned about their own privacy  keep in mind that self disclosure  when used supportively  is more about the feelings than the details  and that we have no problem here with the use of alt throwaway accounts  and have no restrictions on account age or karma        we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others   these people  do  want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims  there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental health issues    if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good  supportive experience  theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers    this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mental health crisis  when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning     if ops want to talk privately  posting on a wide open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option  although we dont recommend it  we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support  if you want to do this  please keep your expectations realistic  and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them  ,1
waking up is one of the worst feelings ever  because then you realize that nothing has changed since you slept and your life is still fucking awful   edit  i just want to say  that after briefly reading the comments  im sorry that many of you feel the same way as i do  theres not much i can say or do to help  but i truly am sorry and i hope that you all can find the time to finally get a good nights sleep and look forward to waking up  ,1
i often fantasize about something tragic happening to me so i have a reason to be depressed or dont have to participate in life for a little while just today on my way to work i found myself hoping somebody would lose control in the rain and cause an accident  ive even imagined contracting covid    so i can self quarantine and not have to deal with life for a couple weeks  edit  welp  i got to work where weve been doing mandatory temperature checks for all employees and i have a mild fever so i got turned away  now that something is actually happening ive become so anxious   ,1

i m     my girlfriend was murdered  the trial is soon and i m getting more and more depressive hi y all  well im not used to posting on forums but i feel so bad atm and i cant open up about this to my family  my friends or my therapist even if they want that  i feel completely unable to talk about it with them  i m a   yo man  i m irish but my family moved to france when i was   and that is where i have lived since  i grew up in a small country village  the school had only two classes  i hardly spoke french but i got a friend very quickly  i ll call her honey in this post   so honey and i were friends all our childhood  we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school  year after year i became bilingual in french and made lots of friends  but i started to have a crush on her  when i was    we started middle school  we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together  but we were pretty shy at that time so we didnt dare to   flirt    finally it was the following year  when i was    years old  that we got in relationship  ofc the feelings i had for her weren t as strong as those i had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but i was so happy   she was the first girl i kissed  the only one actually  we kept growing up  we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together  if i explain that  it s so that you understand that from my   to    years i almost spent every day of my life with her  she gradually became as essential as breathing for me  the more the years went by  the more   serious    important to each of us  our relationship became  we never argue  ofc sometimes we didn t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other  then when i was    we started high school  at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple  because at that age it s unusual  but we loved each other so much  and i still love her so much   it was like i had found the perfect person to me and i dont want to speak for her but i felt like i was perfect to her   we kept growing up  we did our first time together  and all the others  i never had sex with another girl   we wrote long love letters to each other  any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other  i mean  im kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player  people dont really imagine me doing that  yet for her i d have done anything and everything  she was so exceptional  i felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life  we graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment  then started university  i was so glad to live with her  to sleep with her every night  of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn t the same  it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy  when i explained to my new mates from the university that i had been with my girlfriend for   years they were stunned  they asked me if i had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no   since my childhood  i grew up alongside this exceptional girl and i always dreamed of being with her and i felt so lucky to be in a relationship with  i never even noticed any other girl  i found her perfect in every way  we were so happy  i just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was  she was so heart warmed  she couldn t stand injustice  she always wanted to help others  she was so kind and caring  whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call  she was full of wisdom and good intentions  she was always smiling  she illuminated peoples lives with her presence   she was a very funny person as well   she always saw the bright side of everything  she was so positive  she never gave up  she worked hard to reach her goals  she was so clever  i d even say brilliant  she was a very gifted student  she was passionate   when she did something she put her whole heart into it   she made people feeling special  she knew how to bring out the best in them  she always complimented everyone  she was adorable  she was also sensitive  she hated seeing the ugly things of the world  she could cry for that   but she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence   i ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic  she was also incredibly beautiful  the most beautiful woman i ve ever seen  she was an angel  for her friends  for her family  for me  for my family who loved her too  my mam has three sons and she was used to say that honey was like her daughter   my little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me   she spent so much time helping him  because of her he really took control of his life again  everyone loved her  literally   she was wonderful  she was someone who loved to pamper people   she could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone  but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her  i think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive  i felt so good with her  she was the love of my life  literally  i always wondered how she could love me so much  i mean i m not that bad and i always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me  and yet she still looked at me like i was one of the wonder of the world  we were so happy  i was only    years old and yet i saw my life with her and she saw her life with me  we had lots of plans  and even beyond me  she was a great person  who was so young and had her life ahead of her  i mean  if we had broken up  it d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing  living  shining as she deserved   but i cannot bear what happened  we were together  so happy and in love  i never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way   no one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you  someone you love so much  it s extremely harsh  it was a sunday and we were at our parents  for the weekend  sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together  on saturday evening we slept each on our own  her at her parents  and me at mine  there wasn t even a particular reason  on sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but i was lazy  i was tired  i wanted to stay in bed an hour more   it s absurd   i was studying sports science and i was too lazy to go running  i d never forgive myself  it s an ongoing case so i m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn t have to be  but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died  and then her body was burned  suspects were arrested a few weeks later  it was in feb      and the trial was supposed to be in may      but it was postponed because of the coronavirus  france is in quarantine   i cannot even describe the infinite pain i felt when a few days after his disappearance  while very important research was being carried out  her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her  i had a blackout  since i woke up from this fading away i have been taking heavy psychotropes  that doesn t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep  otherwise i have awful nightmares  i never thought i ll fall so low one day  i have always been someone very happy and full blown   but i never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either  i havent been going to university since  i dont do anything except think about her all day  i saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit  how am i supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person i love the most in the world and with whom i grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together   they tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions i have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this  i feel even worse since i know who did this and what their  reasons  were  because they were people i knew  i feel devastated  sometimes i want to kill myself and sometimes i want to avenge her by killing them  but i feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents  who are very friends with honeys parents  they had been friends for a long time before  because we are neighbors  and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened  i can see that they have the fear is that i kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of honey  her parents are suffering so much  they lost their only daughter and i dont know what to do to relieve their pain  whenever i speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden  they say that honey kept living through me  but imo its not true  she no longer lives and will never lives again and i miss her so  so much  but i know if they say that it s because they miss her so much too  she is missed by everyone who knew her  she was so wonderful  and i will always miss her  people tell me that one day when i ll be happy again and i ll meet someone else and go back to normal life  but i know it s wrong  first i ll never be happy again  how am i supposed to live without her after growing up with her   she was as essential to me as breathing  it s unbearable to survive since she s no longer there  how can i resume a normal life   and how can i meet someone else   i never wanted when i was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn t now that i m desperate without her that i ll want to meet someone  plus she is irreplaceable  i feel devastated  she is the only one i want and yet i know she ll never come back  i constantly think of her  of her laughter  her smile  her scent  i bought her perfume and i spray it on my pillow every day  i know its stupid but its the only thing that helps me sleep a little better  i just wanna hug her again  sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least i m   relieved   that honey knew how much i loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away  because i told her every day  just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity  as i no longer go to class  in rugby or to see my friends i don t see anyone and i had not seen some people for several months  they were dazed by my appearance  and i hadnt realized but actually i became the shadow of myself  i always was very   strong   and now i m extremely bony  it depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me  thats why i avoid my friends  they dont know what to say  and i understand thats normal  in their place i wouldnt know what to say either  and they re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me  the only person i used to open up to is honey  and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful  my family is trying to support me as much as they can but its very hard  there was a very bad atmosphere at home  so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to ireland with my older brother  i feel like my mom and little brother dont know what to do with me anymore  but i dont know what to do with me either  i think that after the trial i ll go to ireland for a while as well  just to take a break  here every time i go out everyone is aware of what happened  throughout the region  and even outside  but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more   i m not afraid of the judgement  i know they ll have a long sentence but i m very afraid of the trial in itself and to  during a week or two to  hear what she has been through in detail all day  to see her murderers and to hear what they re going to say  i m anxious i cannot bear it   for the moment i m trying not to think about it  i spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger  we spent all our time there  when we were teenagers and our parents didn t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night  everything remained as it s  when i m there i feel calmer  i feel like nothing can ever ease my pain  i dont even know why i came to tell my story here  i just needed to open up and i cant do it with my loved one  i don t think anyone will have read this anyway  ,1

my   yo lovebug doesnt remember me anymore so my cat apparently got alzheimers and its breaking my heart    all the things we have been through  he has been there for me like no other person in my life has  all the play and joy  hardships  running in and out to the vet  petting him and loving him  waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing  following me downstairs and watch me make coffee    and now  all that is gone  its like he seized to exist  wiped out his hard drive   i got him when i was   yo  my cousin gave him to me  when she learned i had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father  my life was in pieces    but my cat  he mended my heart  he gave me love and support when no one else did  he was there for me  always  no matter my mood  and i loved him so so much    now he is gone  but his physical self is there  but none of his personality  he stopped doing all the things that was him  he is only existing atm  doing all the necessary things like eat  drink  sleep  poo    but not making contact with me  not cuddling  not meowing  i look into his eyes and i dont see him there anymore   i am so sad right now i dont know how to think positively about the future without him  i feel completely shattered   ,1
suicide ice cream i contemplated suicide a few years ago  couldnt take it anymore  everything was going to shit  you could argue it still is   obstructive suicidal thoughts etc  so one day i decided to kill myself by hanging  pretty straight forward right  well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there arent a lot of hanging  friendly trees  they were only on main streets and i cant hang myself in front of the free clinic  id make them feel bad  and someone would take my shit  cant have that  very surreal and fustrating using google maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when youre working with shitty metropcs service   finally i found a spot  small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park  good  now for the suicide note  i get to work  banging it out all through the night   not meant for this world   i know youll miss me but its for the best   hit all the basic bullet points  done  now          make a noose  but idk how to make a noose        so i look it up on wikihow     studious minutes later i have a functioning noose  all of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened  numb brain  im proud of myself   im proud if myself    i try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now   i made a noose  thats kind of dope    what else can i make    homemade ice cream  hmm   so at around      am on a weekday  possibly a tuesday  i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone   p s  the ice cream was terrible ,1

i m killing myself  update  so most of you probably didn t even see my post before  which is fine  obviously  but i just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did    days ago i was so close to taking my own life  i was going to jump off a bridge and end it all  i was drunk so it made matters only worse  as i sat there and thought to myself  a voice came in my head  this voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do  that i have so much more going for me  and i can t lose my life over some girl    so here i am    days later  the girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like  we are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy  my happiness can t be dependent on another person  that is unhealthy  i ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more   staying active  i know in the end i can conquer these demons   i would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night  i obviously didn t respond  but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they re okay  well that is special to me  thank you once again  and i hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life  we all deserve it  this is a disease just like diabetes  and you should not be ashamed of it  instead face it head on  and say  fuck you depression  i m better than you   ,1

people dont realize that coming over and just sitting with you  watching tv or having food or whatever  while youre depressed is the best feeling  i usually decline social events when im really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person  right   so  ill stay home by myself  which makes me feel even more isolated and down  but its not that i dont want to be around people  i just dont want to pretend all night that im this other person    i do that all day at work  its exhausting    but to have a good friend come over and just be there  just sit with you while you watch tv  it just makes me feel loved  which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit  ,1
does anyone habitually say things like  i fucking hate myself  ive developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc im always alone  always thinking them  and talk to myself when no ones looking    its reached the point where instead of saying  fuck  when something goes wrong ill say  i want to kill myself   its become so engrained in my mind that ive come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around    anyone else do this  ,1
why is it that people will call you lazy or weak for not wanting to do anything ever  but then will tell you that suicide isnt the answer  i never asked to be brought on this world  and yet im expected to be a  normal adult  and get a job  move out and maintain relationships  things that ive never known how to do   i feel like if ill be by myself for a month ill end it all honestly  i never asked for any of this  people think this excuse is playing the victim game  and they may be right  but why the fuck is suicide bad then  am i supposed to rot on the streets instead  im just angry and i hate this  thanks for reading  ,1
i wish i could give my life to someone who actually wants to live fuck new years by the way ,1
i ve gotten immensely stupider since my depression i was depressed for around   months before i saw a psychiatrist   got put on medication   i m doing a hell of a lot better now  but i feel like my brain s been completely rotted  it s definitely noticeable for me because i was always so sharp witted   clever   it was something my friend s always pointed out  but now i always fall short in conversations  i can almost never think of the word i mean to use   i m constantly left unsatisfied because i have to reword my entire sentences  i constantly have to say something along the lines of   i don t know what that means  or   i don t get it   i always sit back on debates and really any conversation that requires critical thinking that pre depression me would ve excitedly jumped on  my memory is horrible  i couldn t tell you what i ate yesterday without having to spend a few long minutes thinking on it  i m always the last to get the joke or i have to ask for the joke to be explained  i have to reread things   x over to actually understand it     the list just goes on about things i can t do anymore  i m just all around a slower person   it s so frustrating that i ve fallen so far back  i know i m not the only one that struggles with this  are there any ways to help  or do i just have to reteach myself everything i ve learned  ,1

i ve been told my whole childhood how intelligent i was  now i cant live up to those expectations put upon me by others and myself  i feel like a failure  i am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were  but i dont see it in myself and i cant live up to those expectations put upon me  in middle school i got lazy and relied on my  intelligence  too much  now i i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive    year old self thought that i was somehow special or above average  now in almost everything i score below average and cant keep up with others  its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years  now as everyone else is just about to graduate  its not even clear if i even will graduate  everyone has clear goals and ambitions where as i dont see any real future for myself  ,1
don t you hate it when you re having a particularly bad day and your mood is really low but friends family just assume you re in a bad mood with them  no  i m not angry  no  i m not sad about anything in particular  no  i m not upset with you    i just have no energy and don t feel like talking or doing anything  so please stop making me feel guilty for being this way  please stop being short and impatient with me  please give me time and space    just please  stop assuming what mood i m in and actually listen to me for once before you actually do put me in a bad mood  ,1
anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something  fun   like ill be out trying to enjoy myself and ill be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but i still feel sad underneath  hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling  even hobbies i have just seem dull and im usually just trying to mask the pain so i dont have to feel    i hate this  ,1
realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard  sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually i will commit suicide  this realization really fucks me up  i wish this wasn t the case  i wish so much i could be normal and happy but it s been years and i ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable  i hope i m proven wrong   edit  it s been     days since i posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset i still come back often and read all the new comments  those of you who commented or will comment i see you and just wanted to say thank you we re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together  ,1
i feel like im wasting my life being depressed  i feel like im wasting my life being depressed  i keep hearing give it time  itll get better  yeah maybe eventually itll get better and ill have wasted the better part of my young adulthood trying to figure out how to produce serotonin   we only get one life  and ive already spent a quarter of it feeling like shit   i honestly hope reincarnation is true because if not then ive thoroughly wasted my one chance at a halfway decent life  ,1

i convinced myself i was going to commit suicide sometime in the next   weeks  then i walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful  loving family  now i cant stop crying i want to die so badly  but i cant do this to them  they greeted me with smiles and joy  my mother asking if i ate anything and if i wanted breakfast  my elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how i slept  i dont want to make them suffer  if it werent for them i wouldve killed myself already  they are also sick and need my help  i cant a abondon them  im so sick of living  but i have to live for them  i just want the suffering to end  and dying is the only way  ,1
anyone else feel like their  fake depressed   its stupid  but i always doubt the fact i have depression  even after getting an official diagnosis  im still scared that im just an attention whore taking up everyones time  most of the time when i go to post something on here  i end up deleting it because i dont want someone in the comments to say something like  your not actually depressed  your just a whiny teen   i dont know    edit  hey so im not the only one who feels this way  if anything its slightly comforting to know that  edit    yes im aware of the spelling mistake in the title  its kinda hard to spell correctly when youre rambling at    pm ,1
depression is the hot funny meme until youre not sleeping  not eating  and hoping youll die in a car accident i never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually  like  its funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good  doesnt it  i cant understand how this is just so commonplace    i laugh at them  theyre funny  i see myself in them  and then for hours and days upon days i lock myself in my car with a vague numbness  ditching class or calling off work to just    what  stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot  chew through a pack of cigarettes  and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions  i stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of whos looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn    i dont sleep for days on end until i collapse  i lose weight in   pound intervals  the thoughts of being a fuck up and how bad i would beat the shit out of myself if i met myself on the street just stew any time im beside myself  its so funny  so quirky and relatable  if this is relatable thats fucking tragic  being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something i want everyone to laugh at with me    its three am here and im just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because i dont wanna think about anything  i wish there was a way to turn brains off  medications havent worked and i dont like being medicated at all anyway  it feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime i try to feel anything  sure is loads of fun  ,1
one of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where youre genuinely happy then waking up to reality  this happens to me a few times a year  its like my brain is teasing me  ,1
 you re faking your depression because you look happy  i fucked up  my colleagues friends at work asked me in which reddit group i posted the most stuff  and i said in r depression without thinking  because my brain is a slow  stupid piece of shit  so they said  just because you get sad sometimes doesn t mean you have depression  and  a lot of people are faking depression nowadays  while they both suspiciously looked at me as if i m some kind of murderer    at work i m super  bubbly  and  happy  and it is fucking exhausting  after they said all that  i became too awkward to reply  so i walked away  hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again  i just sat on the ground for a bit  did nothing  felt like shit but also emotionless  like i m floating  empty  alone and misunderstood   i m definitely not faking my depression  and it freaking hurts when people don t believe you because you  seem happy   i automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though i despise being like that  faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when i m finally home i m just dead in my bed   i m not positive or bubbly  i m a negative piece of shit who can t even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday   a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on  yay  super happy   ps  sorry  i swear quite a lot when i m upset   edit  just wanted to say thank you for all the support  kind comments and my first award c  ,1
does anyone else get random moments of clarity where you think  oh crap  im actually very mentally ill   had one of those today  it feels like  for just a moment  i understand that i am indeed suffering from an illness  its such a strange contrast from constantly thinking  youre not actually sick  youre just a terrible person    anyone else experience something similar  ,1

i ve been diagnosed for    years   yesterday i quit my     k  high pressure sales job to become an  th grade science teacher  yesterday i made the decision to make mental health my priority  after years of telling myself money can make me happy     yesterday i decided to be happy     thinking about you all   edit   never received gold before  so thank you kind stranger    also  to those saying teaching isn t easy  no one said that it was easy   everyone has different personality traits   please remember this is a post celebrating mental health  and to instill hope in others    edit     another very large deciding factor   one of my best friends shot himself in the head on christmas eve        the impact is real    ,1
perhaps whats worse than depression is not being able to realize if youre having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same  im having a really hard time keeping up with life  especially since the lockdown started  i just dont feel like i have anything to live for  i  do not  want to be happy  i just dont understand what happiness is to be completely honest  that is not to say that im unhappy and miserable  what im saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me  i just cant separate the two  on top of that  theres this feeling of guilt i keep having about everything  i  am  from a rich family  people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since i learned to walk  but i was never able to be on top  ive always sucked at everything  i tried to be on top  but never made it  and so now im this    year old uni student  and ive been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything  and since ive always failed at that  i feel safer as a failure  i just  do not  feel that i want to succeed  ive become an emotional masochist  sometimes i imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again  thats not to say im suicidal  i am  not   i just like having those kinds of imaginations  the only thing i do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that i listen to music  even my genres are new age  or shoegazing or doom metal  which used to be uplifting epic music  now im not going too much into that stuff  but i hope ive made my point clear  im not looking for concrete advice  perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot  thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post   i truly appreciate it  ,1
i had a personality once but now i cant remember who i am j remember i used to be funny  i used to laugh and make jokes  i remember being able to hold a conversation with people  i wanted to know people and give back  i was shy but querky   talkative and funny around people who knew me    now im nothing  i dont seem to laugh or smile anymore    i feel numb and unsatisfied with everything i do   edit  wow thank you everyone for your responses  i thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that im not alone  we just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on     on a side note    im not sure if anyone else feels like this but   i sometimes think part of the reason is i have this intense fear of losing people  so much in fact that i start believing in  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes theyll like me  and not leave  i just agree and comply with everything  ive done this for so long i just dont know who i am anymore  ,1
god dammit  i should be able to tell people i have suicidal thoughts sometimes without them freaking the fuck out  i feel like killing myself sometimes  there  i said it  doesnt mean im going to do it  i told my wife yesterday that i have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what im doing about it to feel better  needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons i shouldnt and then went and told my mom without my permission  guess im not telling her anything anymore  im in this shit alone  ,1
depression is when you dont really care about anything  anxiety is when you care too much about everything  and having both is just like hell   ,1
i feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead if i had cancer  i could say i needed time off work and everyone would be understanding  i could apply for and receive disability    i could freely tell my patients i was gone for   months or whatever bc i was doing chemo    no one would suggest that i dont need medicine bc jesus died for my sins    i could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldnt think im lazy  theyd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts    people would rally around me  i could post about my journey on facebook without shame    when i fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me i dont have it bad at all  my health problems would be validated    most importantly i wouldnt feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die   edit  thanks for all the responses  let me rephrase something here  i dont wish i had cancer  i wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer  im not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes  ,1
woke up  realized it was christmas  and broke down sobbing  i just woke up an hour ago  i dont know why  but i always really struggle with christmas  i started getting so sad that it was getting hard to breathe  the worst ideations ive had in a while  i almost blocked my fiance because my brain kept telling me that im a problem  thank god my brother came in with the puppy and it snapped me out of it a bit   hope everyone is safe today  ,1
nobody talks about the memory loss i have days where i feel like im being gaslighted or getting dementia  no told me when i was diagnosed about the memory issues  so if this is news to anyone here  you might be going mad but not in the way you think  its just the shitty disease  ,1
it s my   th birthday today  even though i don t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms  birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that i truly am alone  spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food   even if friends were there to celebrate it with me i just can t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy   i m always stuck in my own world of depressing obsessive thoughts and need to be left alone  i don t want to be left alone  ,1
cheers to everyone on here  this sub is the only place i feel accepted  we may be depressed  but we are never dicks to one another or reject each others voices  whenever someone posts something wholesome  everyone cheers for them  nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better     nbsp   whenever someone posts something depressing  everyone comforts them  nobody one ups one another  this subs etiquette is the epitome of  always be nice to people  but if you have nothing nice to say  then dont say anything at all      nbsp   on other subs like askreddit  whenever i post a question  itll always get downvoted right away  i seriously dont care about karma  i just wish my questions become visible because im genuinely curious  my questions are usually something like   people who manage to get their life together  how did you do it       nbsp   i ask those questions because im looking for hope  i try not to make them sound negative but theyll always get downvoted  that makes me feel like im not allowed to hear something wholesome  its like im being denied hope     nbsp   on this sub  it is normal for a post to have  k upvotes  and stays     upvoted  if not       posts that dont take of  and only have   default upvote will usually stay      upvoted  so that means the people here very rarely downvote anything  if theyre not upvoting it  they just leave it be  we use the upvote and downvote for what theyre meant to     nbsp   r depression is not a community in the same sense that r  put hobby here  is a community  were not striving to be good at being depressed  we just want it to stop   but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature   we just want to be heard  i guess  and we understand that about each other  cheers  everyone  wish you all the best of getting through your day  ,1

anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of  tomorrow  feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought  i know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little  but this is different   it s just that knowing that i m not going going to fall asleep and stay asleep  that i ll wake up in the morning and have to do this all over again  is so soul sucking that i force myself to stay up as late as i can   ,1
burst into tears because of animal crossing i ve been having a really rough few months and my depression s been more intense than usual  so i got animal crossing   weeks ago in hopes of it calming me down when it gets bad    a new villager just moved onto my island  and it started singing while staring at the lake  i started crying because it was just so pure and cute that it made me realize how fucking depressed i am  social distancing  being quarantined  not seeing my friends  becoming recently single  on top of my mental illnesses have been so overwhelming  i m so tired of being alive and i wish these feelings would just stop  ,1
i  attempted  suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at     km h and walked out with a minor concussion  i feel like its a sign i need to step up my action against depression  what are some things i can do to alleviate my depression  the title and this story may sound fake  new account to hopefully protect my identity   but i swear to you it could not be more real for me  i wanted to share this  i am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help  more questions will be asked at the end of my story   as the title describes  a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash  the paramedics  police  doctors  nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast i was going  and i replied      km h    i have been depressed for   years now  nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly  i have been on multiple medications  tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy  cbt   and even went a course of electroconvulsive therapy  ect   first my motivation to do anything went down  i couldnt eat  do school work and most importantly  socialize  my social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger  after   years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight         in each eye with astigmatism   sleep apnea and anxiety  i figured life wasnt going to get any better and i decided to end my life   i drove to the mountains where i decided i would find a large hill  go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road  ultimately killing myself  about   hours from my hometown i found the perfect hill  the road was steep  perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash  without thinking too much  i would just talk myself out and not commit   i pulled a u turn and drove to the hill which was about   minutes after that point  they say your life flashes before your eyes  mine played back to me for those   minutes  the most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes  they suddenly disappeared as i approached my chosen hill  my foot automatically floored the gas pedal  i placed my left foot behind the brake so i wouldnt back out  i raced down the hill  gaining more and more speed  by the time i reached the bottom  my car  which only has a speedometer for up to     km h  i saw the road start to bend and i jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn  slamming the front end of the car into the median  that was the last thing i remembered before waking up in my car  with tapping on the window from bystanders  all i could think to myself at that moment was  wow  i so much of a failure i cant even kill myself   a bystander described to the paramedics and police that i hit the median  did about    spins  no flips  and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another    m  i got a glimpse of my car before i was taken away in an ambulance  it was completely destroyed  when i arrived to the hospital i was placed in the trauma room however  the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a     km h car accident  he assessed me and ordered a full body ct scan  the results came back clean  no bleeding  no broken bones and most importantly  no death  he then admitted me to the psychiatry ward  which i wont get into on this post but it was a nightmare       the everyones surprise i was barely injured  walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most  this phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person i have talked to so far has said   its a miracle youre alive   im not religious  but i agree  it is a miracle im alive  and i m not going to waste it  im begging for help because i know this community loves to help people when they reach out  i really want to try and beat my depression but i dont know how  i have tried cbt  im going back to ect for another round of treatment and im on increased medication  i will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists  however thanks to canadian healthcare not until       which is one of the reasons i decided to end it  due to lack of resources    if anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know  im still alive today despite the severity of the crash  and i believe its a sign that i need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life  i am tired of laying at home  with no energy and no motivation  wasting away my life every day with my depression  i can personally say even those who are suiciding dont want to die  they merely just want to stop existing   please help with any advice you have  im begging for my life to change  please  i am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so i can give life another try   here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot     how do i keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time     how can i keep up or have more energy     im thinking of going back to school for nursing  my current position  lab tech  doesnt feel fulfilling and im looking for something more  is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful      what are some habits i could do to alleviate my depression    any secret self help feel good tips     how do i make more friends and build a better support network     what do i tell to my friends who have noticed i just  disappeared  for a few days     x   b   thanks to those who took the time to read this post  i usually get little to no reads on reddit but i thought id share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a     km h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries  if you have any questions  please feel free to ask   edit  more questions  edit    thank you  everyone  for taking the time to write to me  i truly didnt believe this would reach this many people  i will try and reply read everyones post but i am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists  but i am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way  thank you  i will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life  ,1

anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f    up sends you plummeting into the abyss again  it does not even have to be a major incident  but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole  that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around  suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit  and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again     ,1
did your depression mess with your attention span  because i cannot bring myself to focus on things  i could do normally before  be it hobbies  watching movies  reading  and so on  all i feel is lying down all day and doing nothing   edit  mixed feelings with the responses ive been reading  sucks to hear that i am not alone with experiencing this  i just hope that some day  some miracle might happen to our lives and bring back the spark we once lost  ,1

does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them  and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or cure  i literally cannot remember a time in my life where i wasnt angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me  ive had body issues since i was   years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day  which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents  i first started thinking about suicide when i was maybe    or    and    years later i still think about it  i dont think ive ever has a solid year of my life where ive thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living  ive had months of temporary relief from the constant pain  but thats all they were  temporary  i thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasnt  i thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life  but it hasnt  i have lots of friends  an attractive face  and i had a job i liked  no body in my personal life except for two people know that i struggle  and the rest would never guess it  i have nothing to be sad about  really  i have an objectively easy life  but that doesnt matter  i am depressed and i always will be  i could have the perfect body  my dream job  have millions in my bank account and id still feel exhausted  in the same way that people say once an addict  always an addict  ive come to believe the same thing about my depression  ,1

i have no personality does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression  for me the downward spiral started when i was    or so  so being depressed is basically all i remember  i dont know who i was before that  or who i am now    i always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person im talking to  putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality i fake for them  i cant  for the life of me  tell you a single characteristic of me  except for my anxiety and depression    when im alone  i tend to talk to myself  probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction  and yeah i know its weird  and then i feel like a blanc slate  like theres nothing to me    this is my first ever post on reddit and im extremely anxious about it  but ive wanted to tell this to someone for such a long time and now i found this sub  ,1
does anyone else want to kill themself but they don t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt the worst part is now i have a girlfriend that i ve dating for a while and i m crazy about her and we ve talked about our future together numerous times and she s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those i care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy ,1
does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression  when i feel ok  i feel off  when i sink into a depressive mindset  in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied  its like my life is so shit that if im not feeling overly depressed about it there is something off  like im wasting time being ok or even happy  this might make zero sense  but its a feeling ive had for so long  ,1

scared of sleeping because tomorrow will start lately i ve been neglecting sleep because i can t overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things i m behind on whether it s school or even socially  it feels like when i m awake a long period of time i can just manage my stress  unfortunately as i ve been neglecting sleep it s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it s mostly because i have a hard time telling them the truth as to why i m not sleeping   idk just feels like i m trapped   edit  i find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because i hate when people feel bad for me  i ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but i always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems  ,1
i don t wanna kill myself  but i don t want to necessarily exist either  like  i wish that instead of having my crappy  depressing consciousness being tied down to my body  i could just exist as a floating  formless concept instead  right now my mind and body feel incredibly heavy and all i can do is lie down in the dark  i wish i could be free and light and weightless   i don t want to kill myself  i doubt i d even have it in me to inflict physical pain on myself  but i don t wanna exist like i currently do either  can anyone relate  ,1

anyone else previously cared way too much and now is completely apathetic to everything  yup    that s me  i think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and i don t do anything at all and don t accomplish anything because i don t give a fuck and then i look back and so much time has gone to waste ,1
anyone wish there is a redo  i just want to turn the clock back    years and redo everything  and right all the wrongs  now i cant  too late and too much   edit               i did read all the comments  thank you  this thought of regrets have tortured me so much  a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me  in the past two weeks  wrestling my inner demons  i lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest i used to possess  but recently  after watching being erica as some of you recommended  i realized that  no matter where you run  you just end up running into yourself   i suppose regrets will come in different forms  no matter what i do or try  the outcome would be the same that id be short of what i desire to be  to be honest  i dont know what a solution could be here  but i suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle   ,1
i wanted to kill my self last night but instead i called an ambulance no real reason for posting i m just proud of myself for making the choice i did  edit  this is not what i expected  thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support  in the real world  only my partner knows that i even have depression because i don t want to stress people out  i m honestly so overwhelmed  i thought i would answer some common questions in an edit  and i ll slowly get to each comment as i can    firstly the cost  i m an aussie and i have private health insurance  which includes ambulance cover  so it cost me nothing  i can t believe some people have to pay  i wouldn t have called if i knew i did  second   what happened after i called  i had my live in boyfriend with me  and they came in and asked me some questions  eg had i overdosed   self harmed etc   i explained that i had accidentally missed a few days of my medication  and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days i forgot them  i called because i started to feel like i couldn t trust my brain  and i had a plan i was worried i would act on when my partner left for work in the morning  i had also had a panic attack right before i called  which i had never had before and oh boy was that scary  so off i went  it was all very gentle and calm  i basically just needed someone to watch me while i waited it out   for my meds to kick in  i slept in a nice room  was allowed to keep my phone so i keep in touch with my partner  in the morning i was given my meds  i had remembered them the dish before   i had various meeting were they explained that they were happy i called  it was just a relapse  forgetting my meds didn t help  i had a long meeting with a doctor where i went through everything  i was first diagnosed   years ago with ptsd and depression  and the difficulties i ve had getting help  i had a good doctor for a while  but she moved  so they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule  and a new therapist  again that work in my work schedule  most psychs in my area that bulk bill don t do after       bulk bill   in australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system  medicare  is the doctor only charges what they cover  it s referred to bulk billing  basically it s free  but covered by your tax dollars   they also renewed my mental health care plan  my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost  which i hadn t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn t fit me in  lastly i was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker  i haven t meet her yet  but basically she ll contact me regularly to see if i m ok  and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when i m struggling too  i ve nicknamed her my depression pa  lastly they recommended i get my dosage upped a little bit  then i was realised  it was about lunch time  and got sushi  they also rang my boyfriend a lot  plus me texting him a selfie every    minutes on his request  to keep him updated  and to run down my plan moving forward  ,1

i fucking hate being depressed all the time no  im in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry  but i am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good  im tired of having to remind myself that how i feel is not normal  im tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me  im tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today   every fucking day  im tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday  im tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole    pardon the pun  but my depression is fucking depressing  ,1
im a    year old boy who is abused and need help im    years old and i live with my dad  im shared custody from my mom to my dad  my dad is very abusive towards me  ive been diagnosed with depression and ptsd and ive gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time im with my dad i want to kill myself  he pushes me to the limit and im afraid that    ever since i was  little  my dad has always beaten me with a belt  even before i was old enough for school  my dad has beaten me for not doing what i was told to do  he yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be  and that makes me feel sad because i miss my mom  recently  my grades dropped  ive been having problems at school  i have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what im being taught  my dad was pissed  one moment he s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me i wont achieve anything in life  and telling me im going to regret it when he s done with me   my    year old brother also made a bad grade  so he walked into my brothers room and i heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt  then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand  i held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt  i screamed and held my hand  but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again   then he told both of us to come in the kitchen  he started yelling at us saying he was in an  ass whooping mood  and that hed beat us whenever we felt like it  that if we didnt care about our grades he wouldnt care either  that hed make us feel his pain  he hit me extremely hard  my hand was red and swollen  i had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch  he told me to hurry and wash the dishes before hed do it again  and he did  but my hand hurt too badly  he threatened to hold me down   im going to kill myself if i have to continue to live with him  i cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it  i decided that when i go back to my moms on sunday i am refusing to go back to my dads  this is what its come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesnt have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long  so i am not going  i know my dad will call the police if i dont go  when they come  i will talk to them and tell them my situation   can they force me to go  what will they do  because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me  i am in fear of my life and i dont want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so i just cant be around him  i dont know how many times ive tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this   he doesnt care  he simply denies treating me the way he does saying hes never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass  idiot  son of a b        and he even calls my brother those things and denies it  then when were in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person  and his girlfriend thinks that im the problem because he constantly complains about me when really its just a big show   what will the cops do about it when they come  ,1

somebody noticed i am not ok went to a doctor today because i suffered an injury while drunk   the doctor  god bless him  amazing person  saw right through me and asked if i was ok  actually pretty much told me im not ok mentally  asked what happened to me  how do i feel  why do i drink  gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist  for drinking  and to a psychologist   it was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested  it was way beyond his job description   im a bit sorry i opened up only in the most generic terms  but i was already on the verge of tears   unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if im giving all the signs  they get annoyed with me if i dont wear my happy face  but i can not bear to put it on anymore   god  i hope i can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself  because i cant live like this anymore  ,1

do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure  i think about it a lot  my mom has a friend of hers who has   kids  one is in an ivy league school and the other is going to a nice university  they both get good grades  have a social life  and know where theyre going in life    meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone  i dont drive  dont have a job  dont really wash myself unless its been a few days or i have to go out somewhere  i have severe adhd and dont really do well taking basic classes  i just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with  she always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when i was first born  and i just think  if only she knew how i would turn out   it wasnt her fault  though  she is such a loving caring person  she didnt deserve this    anytime my dad comes home from work i have trouble even looking him in the eye because i know im probably such a disappointment in his eyes  i act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background  i wish i could just kill myself and end the bullshit  but that would just hurt them even more  no matter what i do  everybody loses   ,1

im tired of being everyones therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time  ive had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month  i got appendicitis and surgery  still recovering  accidentally twisted my ankle  i got a cold  which im still fighting  however  none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor  they demand it from me       practically  not asking for advice  really just ranting  these are just a few examples   i had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing  and she was complaining about how she hates where she works  i tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else  it wasnt as short as it sounds  i listened to her and gave her serious advice  though i know she wont take it because she never does  instead of thanking me  no one ever does  she tells me that its easy for me to tell her to just get another job because i dont have one and can just sit around and sleep  well  thanks  i just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life  it is a positive joy  we hadnt spoken until her son ended up in an issue and  of course  the family therapist  me  gets a text  asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to  reason   i agree just because i know my nephew doesnt get good support from her  come to find out  shes mad because hes dating some girl who has a kid already  i cant say its great at his age  but hes also an adult  so i just told him to be careful  watch out for emotional abuse  and reminded him of his last relationship  which was like a copy of his moms relationships  she doesnt realize he gets his bad examples from her  after talking to him  his mom texts me and is like   im getting off work in a few hours  ill call and we can do a three way call and talk to him   nowhere did she ask me if this was okay  didnt ask if i was busy or anything  but as with most of my family  since im at home  i never have anything important to do  so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking  like im a human being  i tell her i texted him and i was still recovering and needed to sleep  she didnt ask me what i was recovering from  if i was okay  nothing  just said   okay  night     my niece had trouble at school and shes a lot like my sister  unable to let go of things  shes upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair  a chair this girl wasnt using  mind you  but that was just sitting next to her  my niece calls me  upset and frantic over this because the girl wont let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology  my niece refused because she said she hadnt even done anything and she went to the principal  who told her that the girl is known for  keeping things going   so she wouldnt be bothered again  but my niece wouldnt get off the phone until i promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them  a huge reason i dont have kids is so i dont have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents  yet i have to be a parent to my niece because my sister wont be  mind you  i had just come back from the doctor  had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing  but sleep  i forced myself to stay awake  but thankfully  no one called   then  my sister calls me and is crying  telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house  so  i dont say anything and just let her talk  finally  shes like   i just dont know what to do or how to get him out of my house   i told her to call the police  she doesnt want to get him in any more trouble because he has a dui because he drinks and drives  she allows him to drink and drive her car  because he doesnt have one and doesnt have a license  i wont even touch how stupid that is  so  i get frustrated with her and tell her that i keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens  so i dont know what she wants me to do  she acts like i offended her and is like   i just called to vent  cant i vent  sometimes   i tell her that she can  but im tired of getting calls almost every week about this man  im not her therapist or life coach or anything  im barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because  even if i dont like her very much  i dont want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff  not to mention  her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot    make him leave before he gets to that point  anyway  she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up  maybe i did make it about me  but i want people to understand that i am not a therapist and i cannot fix their issues and im not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff  im not sure anyone is  tbh   finally  we come to today  my mother had to take me to the doctor because i couldnt get there on my own and need support to get there  were talking about normal stuff  then shes like   arent you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing  you really need to get out and get a life   i dont ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like its a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesnt understand why im  letting it bother me  as an adult  id like to mention  she has horrible anxiety  as well  but she powers through it to work  at least  it still takes over her life  she also doesnt do much outside of the house and has no life  but when i point that out  she brings it back to me  anyway  i tell her i just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher  i dont have money to have a life  even if i wanted to  so  then  shes like   if you get a job  youd have more money   i know this  but i have tried many times to hold a job  i cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns  which either end up with me leaving or getting let go  which then leads me into a deep depression  she acts like i dont try and this is even with medicine and therapy  sometimes  im sure the main reason none of this works is because im around my family  but i never tell them that because i dont want to deal with that fallout  at this point  im just tired of the conversation  so i dont respond  then  she brings up how i need to get some friends  at least    says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her  even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her  heavy eyeroll  anyway  i tell her that ive tried to have friends  its not my fault they dont put effort in and either they end up not talking or i fade out because nothing is happening  she asks me why i dont hang out with the people i met last summer  the two girls i met last summer were nice  but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend  which left me and the other girl  we hung out a few times  but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back  so i stopped texting her and let that fade out  this happens too often  so i stopped trying to make friends  i tell my mom that i dont talk to them anymore  and shes like   thats your problem  you dont try and cut people off so quickly   i texted the second girl every day for a week  she wasnt working at the time and she was always posting snaps  so i knew she was available  i wasnt going to keep texting for no reason  i try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them  unfortunately  i am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when i see things obviously arent going along  anymore  she then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month  but they are still good friends and i need to be more  realistic  with friends  what good is a friend whom i only talk to for    minutes once a month and hang out with  maybe once every three months  if that works for her  great  but thats not  getting a life  or anything else  plus  i have a history of getting friends and then i become the  therapy friend  and i fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice  then i dont hear from them for months  when something else is going wrong  thats not friendship  to me    and go back to my mom and my aunt  my aunt is mad at my mom for  checking up on her  at her age and  of course  i get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and wont talk to my aunt  so ive been designated the go between  but i never said i would be  they are     years older than me  why am i even in this   i dont know  im just tired of being everyones therapist and mediator  i keep trying to explain how draining it is  they obviously see i have my own issues  but they continually pour their issues onto me  expect sincere  helpful  empathetic responses  but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesnt answer their phones or i get  advice  that isnt helpful  my niece and nephew would probably talk  but i dont want to burden them with my issues  their mother does that to them enough  and they complain about it  to me  of course  what is it about me that makes everyone think im a therapist  plus  none of them pay me for my services  that probably makes me more upset than anything  if i was a real therapist  id probably be rich off all these  sessions   lol

depression turned me into an idiot  i used to be quite a bright kid  at least  according to what everyone said  after years of trauma and abuse  however  depression completely overcame my life  and after so long  i feel it has utterly destroyed my brain  fried it  like an overloaded computer  i genuinely forget how old i am sometimes  i struggle doing basic math  my short term memory has deteriorated to nothing  etc  i just feel as though im slowing down only more each passing day  if i can ever beat depression  would i have any hope of restoring my cognitive ability at all  ,1
is anyone also more happy relaxed when no ones around  i have gotten used to being alone and i always somehow feel way better when i dont have any friends  it just made me realize that i cant hurt or disappoint anyone in that way  i genuinely feel more well and less depressed   now im wondering if this is actually normal or not  can anyone relate to this  ,1
i m not actually living my life  things just happen to me and around me sorry if this is spam or whatever  but does anyone else feel like this  recently it feels like things are just happening to me  but i don t feel anything  like i m just going through the motions  like a robot on a set program  i wake up  then go about my routine  then before i know it i m back in bed in the evening  and i might as well have not done anything during the day  because i didn t even experience it  and i didn t even put any thought into it  time passes so quickly  and things just happen around me  it s like someone else is living their life and i m watching it from their point of view  it s a weird feeling  ,1
i survived my suicide attempt   yesterday i had lost all hope and just went ahead and hung myself from the ceiling fan   made sure to lock everything so i cant be saved  as soon as i moved the chair under my feet i thought my neck would break cuz it was considerably high but it didnt happen  had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts really bad    half a min in i went unconscious due to the severe pain  woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood  i dont remember how long i did stay that way but apparently not long enough     had a long talk with my parents and its better now  im not sure whats gonna happen next    edit   im   years old ,1
   f  i feel so behind everyone  i feel like a    year old  i know i shouldnt complain at    but ive struggled with depression since i was     every year  for    years  i have few positive memories  im tired and i dont want to do keep trying anymore  everything ive tried never has worked  meditation  cbt  psychologists  psychiatrists  medication  sleeping pills  weed   i feel so young  because i havent literally done much at all with my depression anxiety  but ancient at the same time  i have no passions  no interests  no goals  havent had good friends in years  virgin  i dont go out  i dont take photos  i dont use social media  i feel like i dont exist  i dont even have a fucking job now  never had a boyfriend   literally the only thing ive done is graduate university and i cant even get a fucking job   ive struggled in everything ive ever done  school  hobbies  uni  work  job applications  appearance   the only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs  i just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life  even people who are        have had more experiences then me  i hardly go out  ive spent     of time at home alone with my elderly parents    i try so hard  but im still a loser and i hate it  im not introverted and i just hate how my life has become  i hate it  i do  i feel like i must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better  these last   years in particular have flown and im just so fucking done   its not like ive tried  for   years ive tried joining groups  volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere  no one wants a bar of me   there is this little person jumping inside me wanting to live  but my brain and heart is just so done  ,1
my sister saved my life yesterday  there i was minutes away from grabbing my gun  about to walk in the woods and end it  was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too  not having to hate myself  going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore  then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me  blue with a guitar on it  and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar  it said made in       love nikole  i almost cried in front of her which is something shes never seen me do  it just hit me so hard  like beyond words  my family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves  i just thought to myself  how could i put her and everyone else through such a thing  spent half the night crying like a little girl  im   m  still woke up feeling like garbage  but i dunno somethings different  i guess that feeling like someones thinking of me is helping a bit  i cant say anything to her now but in the future im really gonna thank her for that  i still feel like i dont wanna be here  but whereas before it was       now im slightly on the fence about it  hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me  i should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me  plus then the whole family would know  thats why i like coming here  it hurts but i feel like i must press on  ,1

please don t give up on me i m trying  i haven t been happy in five years  but i m trying  i think about suicide every day  but i m still here  i m hanging on  i m trying to believe that maybe i ll find happiness again  maybe i will find faith gain  maybe one day i will find people who care  i know you see me struggling and i feel you look at me with eyes of disdain  i hear your thoughts    she s a lost cause   she s too much   i wish i had never talked to her   i know you don t like me and you would probably be happier without me but i m begging for someone to please stick around  to please not pull out  even if you just pretend to care please don t give up on me and maybe even just pretend to believe that i can get better  because i can t do this alone   and if everyone around me leaves  then why should i stay   edit  thanks for the awards and support  it means a lot     ,1

depression is having no drive  purpose  passion  or commitment i go through life with a lingering sense of worry  fear  doubt  uncertainty  regret  and utter lack of passion or drive  i am constantly worried about something going wrong  lack focus and passion for what i do professionally and have no confidence in anything  i feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig  toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues ,1
i feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential i always felt that i could have been something way better than i am now  i am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if i had done things differently  ,1
these random spikes of happiness and hope really fuck you up after  nothing matters now  you guys ever get outside  get that extreme spark of motivation like   fuck yeah  things are looking up for me now  this world can kiss my ass because i m gonna make it out of here   then  what feels like seconds later  something comes and rains shit on you  it s like nothing ever lasts  when the fuck are people like us ever gonna get a break  were shoveling shit all day  everyday and nobody fucking cares  but the instant we say we re giving up  everyone s like  oh no  you have so much to live for  think about x y  and z  you can t give up  things are gonna get better   yeah  shove it up your ass  you re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when i m dead and gone  you think you care  but you re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another  good luck with that  i m tired of being told to get help  with what fucking money  all just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because i m so fucking shit at doing it without paying  what the hell is the point of trying  i m stuck here  just like i ll always be  just give me the freedom to take my leave  i ll be happy then  but i ll be decaying in the ground by then  ironic  huh    i wish things were different  ,1
i miss the person i used to be ill admit that even years ago i wasnt very happy and had problems  but i still miss the way i was back then  i still had things that made me happy  hobbies i enjoyed  and i actually had the motivation to do them  i could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while  now i cant find the motivation to do anything   but i think most of all i miss how hopeful i was  despite everything i fully believed that itll get better  that the future will be a good one for me  and ive lost that completely  i dont have any hope anymore  i dont have any motivation  i dont have anything to look forward to  and i just really fucking miss that part of me ,1

depression and perfectionism is hell it really is a horrible combo  i was raised to believe that there was no room for mistakes  that i wont always have someone to help me  now  everytime something goes wrong  my entire sense of worth just leaves me  ive been told that im talented at a few things  particularly writing  yet  if i was actually talented  i wouldnt be having so much trou le with my manuscript  mistakes literally cripple me  and make me not want do anything  for me  not trying is better than trying and failing  edit  thanks for the gold  kind stranger  ,1

happiness really is a privilege growing up i never thought about it like that  i always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm  and that anyone who wasn t happy was some outcast  now i see happiness really is a privilege  and i don t say this in spite  if you are happy  that s amazing  but also i think there are a lot of people who don t realize how lucky they are to be happy  it truly boggles my mind that there are people who go to bed excited for the next day  it s a feeling i don t think i can remember having  at least for a very very long time  ,1
today was my   st birthday i turned    today  i live in one of the biggest college towns in the country  when you turn    here  its a big deal  i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends  im not the party type or anything  but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with  today i received three texts  more than most days   one from my mom  my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday  in all fairness  i dont have a facebook and i dont expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything  but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone  i guess ive never been comfortable with having a facebook  the idea of being so interconnected which each others lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me  but i think in not having a facebook  ive sacrificed my social life absolutely    anyways  ive spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college  there is not a single person who if i called them right now  they would pick up and talk to me  ive been fighting with my parents and after a few shared unpleasantries  are not answering my calls because they want we  to cool off   and understandably so  ive been no contact for ever a year with my girlfriend   i knew from highschool  who i ended up dating long distance when we started college  today  i made an attempt to call her  went to voicemail  to ask her if shed let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but i havent heard from her  it really breaks my heart that i lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life  i assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday  i certainly didnt forget hers    anyways  if youve made it this far  from the bottom of my heart  thanks for listening to me vent     edit  the reddit community has been absolutely amazing  you guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe  ive been getting offers for people to buy me drinks  and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk text me if i was still feeling down  you guys are unbelievable  you turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays ive ever had  from the bottom of my heart  thank you  for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet  thank you  your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially  i cant say it enough  thank you  thank you  thank you   ,1

i hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents  but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs  ive been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job  im a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just    miles away from my hometown  working there has been pretty easy  but i wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering i dont really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much   so just today i came home late as usual  and i have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that i took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor  i told her that i didnt really want to joke around like that  but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then  despite attempting to change the topic and explain why i havent been feeling so high  all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house  what an ungrateful little bastard i am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices    at that moment i was legitimately about to begin to cry  but rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages  all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks  i got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek    and even before i went to bed  she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours  then escalates into a more  this is why youd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel  considering i had practice driving this morning  unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework  but she didnt seem to care    thanks for reading  i hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness  along with having a parent who doesnt make your suffering all about them and why you shouldnt be depressed  ,1
depression ruined my creativity i cant use my mind in the way that it used to work  i cant think too strongly  i cant think too deeply  i am a shell of my former self  it hurts to use my brain  i have no strength for patience and doing what i want to  i am weak  i escaped depression  but i am weak    edit  so many beautiful comments  thank you all for sharing  i love this community as its very insightful and you dont quite feel as alone as you may think you are  ,1
in your experience  is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person  what i mean is that i constantly worry that im not actually depressed  that im just lazy and dont want to take the next step in life  that i dont want to put in the work to get where i know i want to be  so im wondering if anyone relates to that ,1
do you ever wish you would accidentally die  i would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes i wish something else would just do the job for me   ,1
have you ever seen your friends smile and thought  yeah they are better off without me   ill start by saying this   under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly   its been a while since that happened  the bell rang and the break began  so i went to find them and when i did they were laughing so hard  i was in my very lows that day   i felt so nice for them and at the same time i thought  i cant offer them that   before we went back to the classes  i let them walk infront of me because i didnt feel like being      in the mood and just by looking at them i kept thinking how great they are together  now today i saw some insta stories of them staying at the house of the one i am closest to and it kinda hit me again  i hope i am not just jealous  its just that at points i feel like i annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that   i always tell jokes and laugh and     of the time they wont even notice the state of me because of how well i hide it  i love them  yet i am sure they deserve someone who is not like me   especially the one i am or used to  yes i am insecure  be closest to  she deserves the world and shes always been there for me but i cant keep being a burden to someone so kind  whom i love so much  i just feel like they  clicked  so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that  especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend   anyway thanks for reading    what about you   edit   thank you everyone for replying  each and every one of you  i havent answered to everybody  sometimes i dont know what to say but i have read all the comments  i love you all   p s   i dont know what this silver plate is but  i guess  thank you kind stranger  i hope you are doing fine  all of you  ,1
does hearing  college is the best time of your life  or  enjoy being young while it lasts  freak anyone else out  because for me  probably like for so many of us here  it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time  i wouldnt even say im looking for help or reassurance with this post  more just curious if this fomo is widespread    ive devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures   tons of social hobby clubs  going out to bars and trying to dance with people  attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events  whether because im interested in the event itself or because i feel like going would make me seem more interesting    and i hate all of it  i havent met a single person i enjoy spending time with  even my academics make me miserable  to top it all off  when someone detects im pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards  because we know thats what life mostly is for us  a choice between faking happiness confidence or revealing just how negative pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time  ,1
i want to be left alone but don t want to be alone  so i ve felt with depression for about    years now and it s always so confusing when i push people away but still want them to care for me  instead of going out and doing things with my friends i ll stay at home and cry  instead of reaching out to people i ll think about how they probably hate me  whenever i try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all i m doing is complaining  i m just so tired of feeling like this  does anyone else feel like this  and if you have do you have any advice for me  ,1
today i got a haircut  shaved  cleaned up my desk and walked the dog small step for a man but a giant leap for my mental health  ,1
so sick of hearing  you need to go out  and  put in some effort  go where  i don t like bars  i don t like to drink too much  especially if i m driving  where else do people go to socialize   i don t have friends or even know where to go to make friends    i try every opportunity i get it but i don t get many opportunities because i have no idea where to go socialize    i m just sick and tired of being alone      and feeling completely hopeless to change it  this makes me sad as fuck     ,1
you wanna know the worst thing about depression  to me  its that depression doesnt kill you desire to want to do things  it doesnt kill your dreams and what you want in life  it just stops you from doing them  its like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage  depression  locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them  i dunno but to me thats one of the worst things about it  p ,1

anyone else feels like they are annoying everyone  i get ill or upset over something  mum yells at me   i m too tired because of work  sudden change in environment and social circle  went from having friends to not knowing anyone  and depression  sister thinks i m being lazy for just not wanting to do something last minute on my only day off  or for not washing a mug and a plate straight away   i m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something  friend says  why are you so snappy lately  or  what do you expect me to do   nothing  i just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong   i feel like no matter what i do  i ll always be annoying to everyone around me  i m sorry for not being super happy atm  i m just having a bad fucking time which apparently nobody understands  ,1
if isolation is bad  why does it feel so good  why do i feel even more inhuman when im with others   i dont want to talk  i dont want to smile  i dont want one of my friends to listen  im sick and tired of speaking  of explaining      whenever im alone  i might have moments of sadness  but i also moments of joy     when im with others  i forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like i am caught to spend time with them      i dont want people to occupy  me or make me happy   i just want to be how i am  angry  sad  tired     and just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how i feel and why i feel that way       i dont even want help  because everytime someone tries to help  it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that i dont want     its not that i see my depression as a disease or illness  i see it as a symptom for something deeper  for the fact that i simply dont want to be part of this society  be  normal   hang around with others     meeting friends feels so pointless  so shallow  like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments  i dont want to forget  because i actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something      if your leg hurts because you broke it  you dont just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine     you have to see whats wrong and adjust it  and right now  every form of human interaction feels like im doing a marathon with that leg    ,1

after three months of almost crippling depression  i finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and im very proud of myself    ive been struggling with depression for about three months now  ive had severe depression  social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from      to beginning of       harmed myself and tried suicide a few times  but i started a treatment  took medications and got  cured     i guess depression never leaves  right  we just learn how to deal with it and control it but its probably never truly gone    that makes me terrified  but i might me wrong      but now all of this feelings are coming back and im panicking  i have no motivation whatsoever to go to work  im arriving at least one hour late every single day   i cry every morning and every night  im becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general  thinking no one would want to be with me cause im a failure  i get too anxious to reply to anyone  im feeling alone  abandoned  ugly  insecure  unworthy  stupid  weak     i tried to create a to do list to get me occupied  stop using the uber app to go to work when i can perfectly walk  its just     kms   or about     miles   cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food  start exercising  my apartment building has a gym where i can use wherever i want   go to bed early  wake up in time  have breakfast before leaving the house  reply to all the messages ive been avoiding for months  start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit  get out of my art block and start drawing again  post more things on my artistic social media so i can be more active  start applying for jobs  i dont get paid enough and hate my current job   finding a new apartment to stay  my roommate is my exes cousin so its a bit    weird    just  simple  things i thought i could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself  but i cant  i literally cant  every time i try to get out of bed in the morning i cry cause i simply cant  i walk in front of the gym and just want to cry  cant even step on it  sometimes i can even put on my gym clothes  i turn on my computer i just want to die  my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working  im always procrastinating and pushing people away     i think the thing thats bothering me the most is that i cant achieve the simplest goals  and im failing even on the silliest things in day life      i dont have suicidal thoughts anymore  neither the urge to hurt myself  so sometimes i just feel like this might not be depression  its just perhaps me not trying hard enough    but either way i cant live like this anymore  ive been deeper before  but that doesnt mean my life is wonderful  it took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist  my appointment will be next friday  im very nervous  but relieved  i really hope things get better from now on so i can have a normal life again     ,1
 depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die   this was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class   we have this facebook group where we submit all our photography works     and it just resonated with me    depression is such an ass  struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that i ended up self harming and nearly killing myself three times this year  and i couldnt do it because im too afraid  i want things to end  but i couldnt    at this moment  im not suicidal  im not even at the point that im severely depressed to the point i cant function normally  it just resonates with my struggle  especially with my experience for years  but this year in particular    the fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesnt  the fact that i still have it despite having great family  friends and a loving girlfriend  the fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely  the fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future  and ultimately  the fact that i realize that its such a miracle that im waking up each day  still alive  and bravely battling depression   peace out  and much love  ,1
i have constant passive suicidal thoughts recently i think i ve been okay  not super happy  but not completely down in the dumps  but ever since about a week ago  i ve been getting passive suicidal thoughts  if you don t know what that is  it s when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it  this has happened every day  even this morning  my first thought when getting out of bed was  i should just die  these thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what i have to do during the day  which makes me feel useless  which makes me think about suicide  it s an endless fucking cycle and i hate it  ,1
do you also sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are not depressed anymore  every now and then i start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything  i start to have all these ideas about how i will change things around and become a better person etc  just to find that the morning after im as depressed as ever  if not more  its like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say  psyche  you still suck   ,1
you dont know how much depression affects you until you have a good day yesterday i played video games with my best friend all evening  and afterwards i laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier  i suddenly realized an odd  light  positive feeling in my chest  id forgotten how nice good days could be  and how giddy  bone deep happiness felt  i hope this is a sign im getting better again   ,1
my dog just saw me crying on the back porch and started barking at random things  she wasnt sure what was making me upset  but she wanted to scare it off  getting a dog hasnt cured my depression  but she sure has made it easier to deal   i love this dog  ,1
does anyone else  when theyre in a really depressed mood  feel like theyre just acting sad to get attention  i mean myself personally  whenever i feel down i automatically start shaming myself by saying im only acting like this because i want someone else to feel bad for me  but i know thats not what i want  or at least i think its not what i want  idk  does anyone else ever feel like this though  ,1
anyone else jealous of others happiness  it could be over the smallest thing  whenever i hear someone talk about hobbies or anything i am just envious of them  i wish i could enjoy things  i wish i could actually have the desire to do anything  it hurts    i absolutely hate when people ask me  so what are your hobbies    what did you do this weekend   shit like that  i have no answer because i just stay in my damn bed whenever i m not at work  the other day someone asked me  have you done anything interesting lately   i just straight up said  no  i m boring    i hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me  and i get it  why would you want to be friends with someone like that  i don t blame them  but goddamn i wish i wasn t like this  its not a choice  i wouldnt wish this on anyone  it s literally the worst  a curse  why couldn t i just be normal and have a happy life ,1
does anyone else just wanna start new i just want to move to a town where no one knows me and start fresh  i m struggling so much ,1
i just wish i could be asleep for the rest of my life probably sounds stupid but the only thing i look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for    hours  i like dreaming  i wish i could sleep longer ,1
don t want to sleep because tomorrow will come faster all i want to do is get in bed and sleep forever  but i can t seem to bring myself to sleep because that will just bring tomorrow faster and that is worse than just lying here exhausted   does anyone else ever feel like that   i m new to this level of depression and am at a loss   i really don t know what i want to say or hear  but thank you for letting me rant and for listening  ,1
people who are depressed should reach out to their friends   tries to reach out  nobody replies  update  so  i thought it would only be fair to post this update  while one friend still doesn t seem to give a fuck  i m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow  turns out she s been having a thyroid flare up  one other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we ll see about that  some people care but have stuff going on  other people don t care  pay more attention to the former   original post  seriously  fuck everyone  it s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked  but who s really willing to listen  only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way  the rest of them are just faffers  capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable  including friendships  hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk  more often than not it s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves   edit  it is usually better to talk to a therapist  if you can afford therapy  that is  about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with  i dont recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away  people have enough shit in their own lives to deal with  however  it sucks if you want to talk with a friend who clearly knows youre going through a tough time and they dont return your call    edit    looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical  but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need  a big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful  if you can  please seek the help of a therapist  it has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i need deserve from them  it can be a long drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt  but please persevere if you have the means   thanks to everyone for your comments  i m trying to reply to each one but it s hard to keep up  so i m sorry if i miss yours  remember you re worth the effort and the struggle  so please hang in there   edit    if youre in the us  uk  canada or aus  you can use this directory to find a therapist near you  read about them  what insurance they take etc  https   www psychologytoday com us therapists  ,1
being called lazy  useless  and internet addict is a daily routine for me  before  i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way   i was wrong   my dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day  reading  stupid  useless novels   and refusing to go to school   mu grandma  keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday   my sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff   my mum is dealing with my dads manic episode and my sisters upcoming national exam  she doesnt have time to deal with me   they all know i am depressed  and they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all  in your head    i use my phone and games as an escapism  i need to distract myself so i wont constantly think abiut depression   i am so tired of being called lazy  if i had some more energy to get up and do the stuff i like  i would do it  but everyday i feel like my body is deteriorating  and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto   schools not any better  all of my classmates are nice but i just   cant handle the socializing  i hate being contacted  and i cant get anything into my head  i feel like my brain function is shutting down   i used to be so good  kind to others  excelled my studies  can connect with anyone   i feel so tired of keeping up the mask  i cant carry on their expectation  even if i want to  i cant handle it  ,1

i really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc   depression doesnt exist   you just want to be special and quirky   you stay in bed all day cause youre lazy   most people diagnosed with depression dont even meet the diagnostic criteria   why cant you just be happy    depression is just an excuse     x   b   i think ive heard it all at this point  really if depression doesnt exist  is that why i lay in bed all day starving myself  if depression doesnt exist  is that why i leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time  i didnt realize being smelly was special and quirky   if depression doesnt exist  is that why i wont leave my house  do you honestly think laziness is the reason i was reported as a missing person to the police  if depression doesnt exist  why do i cry when i glance at myself in the mirror  why am i isolating myself from family and friends  why did i cut into my wrists  why did i abuse substances  if depression didnt exist     x   b   an open letter to all those people out there saying  just be happy   thats cute  youve probably had a comfortable life  with parents who loved you  unlike me  whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic  my dad first invalidated my diagnosis at    by saying depression didnt exist  he also threatened to kick me out onto the streets  and then again   years after that when my anorexia got worse  he just keeps me around cause i have some leftover money from school and he wants it     x   b   ive come close to suicide a few times  once when i was    and another time when i was     recently its been on mind  as im hitting new lows  but i dont think i could ever do it cause im just so in love with my boyfriend  though  if he ever betrayed me who knows what id do  i dont know myself  it feels like i have no one  except him  and i know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships  ,1
i m not gonna kill myself  but i hope to god that i ll die  life seems pointless honestly  it s too much  i m too tired  no one particularly cares about me except for my parents so if i die it wouldn t affect anyone  i haven t felt like i ve lived life in years  i m just a person watching myself go throughout my day   edit  i really appreciate all of the comments  i m reading all of them and i m trying to respond to all that i can  thank you guys so much  ,1

i almost feel like i should ve killed myself a long time ago and now i m just living out a life that wasn t meant to happen  i feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself   i would just die and i would never have to get to this part of life  it would just happen like that  but now i feel like i missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn t planned out because it should ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised  and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before   because in all honestly i feel like i tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then i never went through with it and now i ve given up trying on work and stuff  i don t know whether others feel this way  but maybe in another alternate reality i did kill myself at the right time and that s why i feel so wrong because i didn t  who knows ,1
why do people tell me being alive is special  this is life  mundane days like these from morning to evening until we die  theres no fucking transcendent spiritual bullshit crap  its just fucking this  i woke up a few hours ago and ate too many chips and too much chocolate pudding until i felt sick   then i read the news and felt sick   then i read r popular and felt sick   then i looked at the mirror and felt sick   whats up with this crap  what do people see there  its the same old shit every day  im not even hopeless im just annoyed because everyone is so delusional   life is more of this  locations  schools  work places  are just wallpapers that are changing  personality  clothes  haircuts  are just avatars that are changing  success is just reaching higher levels in the same shitty game  the emptiness  the pain  the anxiety  stays the same   life is stabbing you  hurting you  mocking you  and offering you ice cream  then people ask if youre depressed because you dont like ice cream  no  i dont like ice cream fucking hell  why dont you stick it up your     sorry  i just needed to vent a little     edit  i just want to remind everyone that this is a venting post  maybe its not wrong  but its also not a normal or healthy way of thinking  a depressed world view can be  valid  while depression is  still an illness   its an illness that can  in many cases  be treated  its always worth to try to make life less miserable  ,1
anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb  i feel like i dont think as much anymore  like depression killed all my brain cells  im just numb and floating and not interested in anything  i cant remember words very well  sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air    edit  wow i didnt think this would get so much response  i made this post while i was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important  now i feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone  im sorry youre all feeling the same way  i know how hard it is  thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences  it really made me feel less alone   i truly dont think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it  we just have to recognise that its this horrible disease doing it to us  i wish i could hug each one of you individually    ,1

i no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone  i used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything  i no longer believe that  i think hard work  wit  the help of others  and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone  this was quite a blow to me  im trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment  ,1
if i knew what i know now i wouldve just killed myself when i was    all this pain and suffering  hurting other people  wasting peoples time  dragging myself through life just to be in the same place   years later  this fucking medicine doesnt help  nothing helps  im just tired of it  ,1

i hate it when people say  well occupy yourself  when you re depressed  people often say to take your mind off depression  go do something  play music  focus on school  etc  but the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down  just as alcohol is a temporary fix  although it is destructive   using music  exercise  etc is just as pointless  i work out and then i feel great and then afterwards  i remember my situation and my life and i feel depressed again  if it s not resolved  no amount of  substitutes  can help  all these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can t close   edit  wow i didn t expect this to get so many likes  my first post with over  k likes  i m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way  ,1

does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people i hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist  ive been depressed for past several years but one thing ive always had is my family which im grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare i not be happy with all i have  anyway ive purposely hid this from them because i dont want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type whos always seemingly upbeat and has his life together  the fascade is exhausting  ive wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldnt even understand  maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until i get better   ,1
my parents just yelled at me for   hours  my mother decided to take me to the hospital tomorrow  so at dinner  i asked my parents which hospital we will go  father astonished  he didnt know we have such a plan  i fucked up   he started yelling   shes not crazy      shes not sick at all      shes normal     blah blah  mother yelled back  and all of a sudden  they turned at me  i dont need to mention the rest   i cant stop crying  im so fucking desperate  my mother uses my fathers high blood pressure to threaten me  said if i cant be a nice daughter he will die from stroke because of me  i know  i know ive done nothing wrong  but i cant stop thinking about that possibility  i feel guilty  its all because of my existence  i wont commit suicide tonight but i dont know about future  fuck  fuck  ,1
every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it it happens every time  they say to reach out if youre struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down  people either make it a competition about who has it worse  or try and tell you that you dont have  real  depression  another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse  for some reason it always happens with this illness  can this stop already  ,1
   months ago  i tried to kill myself    seconds  that s how long the emt says i was gone for   my body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts  i took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard  downed a fifth of tequila  and put a pipe to my car s exhaust into the driver s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over   i passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney  confused  sobbing  and hysterical  my housemate got home early and found me  i was admitted into the icu  spent my birthday  christmas  new years  etc in the psych ward for three months going through ect   all i can think of lately is not messing up this time  it hurts because i m a perfectionist  and i couldn t get it right  ,1
i dont know myself outside my mental illness is hard to think that i can improve and get better when ive had either anxiety or depression since i was     ive read some people that have beat depression as getting my old self back but i dont know how that feels like  idk  its hard to think that i will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an old me that actually enjoyed life    having some bad weeks lately  thank you if you read this little rant   edit    god damn i wasnt expecting all this attention  im really new to reddit so im just  kind of speechless  ive been reading   all   your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you  you took the time to answer and help me when i was feeling sad and hopeless  even if it was to say that you are in the same situation  you made me feel understood and less alone  i will try to be patient with myself and  as some of you said  work to get better so i can discover myself little by little  its a long  long road  and right now it seems so hard and impossible  but i will try nonetheless   i will continue answering all the comments i can  but i wanted to add this first   i hope we all recover and start feeling better soon  you all deserve to be okay  thanks again to everyone  ,1
am i the only one who constantly imagines living a different life and different scenarios in my head  i heard other people that do this but ive never known if anyone does it to the extent i do  i ll spend so many hours everyday just lying in bed imagining myself living all these different scenarios kinda like a story in my head  it s almost like im living a different life in my head where i do whatever i want  it s really sad when i think about it but my life is just so boring it s the only thing that brings me joy  ,1
does anyone else wish they could die from an outside cause like it s fucked up  but i wish i would get cancer or have someone hit my car and push it off the edge of the canyon or something  a terminal illness or an accident would do the job and make it so that my mom wouldn t be as sad  i just want to die but i don t really want it to be my fault necessarily  ,1
i need constant background noise  youtube  watching series  because im afraid of being alone with my own thoughts  going to sleep is scary because i dont know how ill feel in the morning  just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort  it feels like im not entirely alone then  my friends cant really get through me and im constantly tired  in order for things to change i need to do something  but to do something i need energy    so yeah     i want to sleep the entire time and im much more exhausted in general  but im also afraid  will i feel better when i wake up or worse  ,1
i dont feel like i have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore  i dont know if these are just symptoms of depression  but i feel so distant from people that i used to consider friends  they never come in contact with me and i cant bring myself to contact them either  and when i do  its often just short lived conversations or i end up being left on read  my main circle of friends kind of broke off  and now they never seem to plan anything with me  i feel so alone  but at the same time  it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others  as for finding new friendships and relationships  i feel like ive met someone but i find it so hard to trust them and i feel so scared all the time that its never going to work out or if theyre even interested  i honestly feel like im not even a priority for them but i feel so guilty and self absorbed for feeling this way  i dont know if i should tell them because it might make me feel clingy  i dont know what to do and i feel hopeless   edit  thank you for gold  hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers  sisters  and siblings get through these hard times ,1

i really wish i could kill myself before the new year so i dont have to deal with whatever misery      is going to bring there have been like  at least three suicides on the tracks this month and i so very much want to be one of them   but as much as i want to commit suicide i dont want to commit murder  and it would kill my mom if i did it  so here i am facing another lonely worthless year  im so tired of this  im just so  so tired  i dont know why im posting  like i said im not going to do it  i wont do that to my mom   but i really wish this could be over  ,1

i want to fucking die fucking  holy fuck  holy fucking shit  god take me early  ,1
the most depressing part about turning    is when you start thinking  this really is my life after all  when you re     you can make mistakes  you have the time to fix them  they don t define the rest of your life  you have a decade   to build a life for yourself  there is always that hope that one day  things might turn out well for you  there is excitement  life is full of colour  but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale   then you turn    and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you is the road you re now walking down  and all you can see is darkness for the next    years of your life   nobody is coming to save you or bail you out    i would give anything to go back and do things over  but there is no reset button  you can t start a new save file  all you can do is turn off the game   for people in their late teens early twenties   don t waste a moment  appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with  they disappear without warning and one day  it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever  ,1
does nostalgia bring up your depression  whenever i think back to when i was younger and happy  i realise that my life is worse now and itl never be how it once was   just found my old pokémon pearl cartridge in a box and looking at it made me remember how much i enjoyed life when i was    now i feel like shit ,1
does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they cant get rid of  maybe this has been talked about in other posts but im new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain    does anyone else feel like your head is a fog  or like your living a video game  controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached  the feeling of un motivation  detachment and numbness has only gotten worse  im    now   i notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight  even though i know what the outcome will be  sometimes even as far as not being able to think  as if my brain is just a static tv     i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling normal  or even periods of time  but it always leads back to that same empty hole   i feel like my brain is broken  like ive been missing out on how everyone else feels  ,1
having friends and family that dont understand depression is awful it makes me feel like a freak  and so unloved  ,1
ive told   college professors that i am suicidal in less than   days of each other and   i was quite shocked at their reactions  i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason  the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well being  he too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger  and the second professor  he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well  he was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually  that was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors    edit  i really cant express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are  i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester  and it is doing wonders  hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help  also  thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others  thank you greatly  ,1
this is not the life i imagined for myself i was bullied in elementary school  and i always used to tell myself that its only temporary  that life will be good later  like in the movies  all i have to do is wait until im     im gonna have friends  have a girlfriend  go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult   im    now  no friends  no girlfriend  i lost my job recently due to a work injury    the life never really got better  im no longer being bullied by other kids  im being bullied by my own head  every year is another wasteful  unfulfilling stepping stone on the road to death   it doesnt get better  ,1

ive been left out of everything  and someone actually cared  so  basically  my school is crap   teachers dont care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here  i didnt think the students did  until today   there was an odd number of girls today since one was off  and we had to go into pairs  of course  none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys  so  i sat at the side and said i was fine not doing it   however  one of the boys asked why i couldnt go in a three with one of the girls pairs  if you couldnt tell im female  and in my school girls and boys dont like to go together much   but all of them said  no this is a paired activity   so he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if i wanted to go in his pair   he got a detention  just at lunch break  for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by  but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity  and that someone actually cares   it was the first time id felt happy in a long time  to be honest  ,1
i hate it when people criticize me for not doing enough because of my depression  i am literally trying my hardest  this is my best right now  stop comparing me to someone with perfect brain chemistry  im doing all i can  this is going to have to be enough for you because its barely enough for me   ,1
does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn t actually have depression at all  even despite an official diagnosis  i constantly think  anytime i want to share my thoughts  that i m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones  it makes me feel guilty the moment i open my mouth to talk about how i m feeling  anyone else   it makes it worse that every time i talk to my partner about it  she always twists it into some underlying meaning that i don t want to be with her  and i get livid that she s made it about her  maybe i am just selfish and attention seeking   ,1
do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years  im a sophomore in college right now and i am constantly surrounded by wise people    people who did things with their lives in high school and didnt waste it away crying  starving themselves  neglecting their work    they were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all  they were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues  they were able to make friends without poor social cues   i had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday  and even then i never had positive influences to help me  my parents were so busy with work that since my youth i was always alone at home  i have trouble having fun    i cant emotionally feel like a happy person  its always forced  it doesnt come naturally to me so people didnt like people like me   im too lazy to write this but basically i feel so bitter  i wish i did more so i could show off my potential but nope  i wasnt certain of myself ever  im trying to improve but my past latches onto me     sigh   edit  i have something to add  first  i am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post  we all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past  i also didnt get to finish writing this  because i hadnt the energy to finish  but there were moments where i stopped eating  showering  and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time  i also hid my feelings all the time  when people used to say   you dont understand   it would hurt so much because i really did in some way  or so i thought  i had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but i was never very honest because i was always afraid of the consequences  i feel a little bit of pride i guess saying this but i feel like im an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all  like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until i can remove it completely  nowadays i struggle to even read sometimes  i just don t have the strength  but i try   i do say though writing this was therapeutic because i am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading  ,1
do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because youre not doing anything productive and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol ,1

casually suicidal do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death  you think about the consequences of it and what peoples views are on it  maybe you have even considered suicide  you brush it off  most likely  that is what most people do  people are scared  i am scared  who would actually want to die though  right  this is what casually being suicidal is  can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time  i have a fear of death  i always have  always will  how is it that some days i want everything to end  but i don t at the same time  its my biggest fear but also my biggest relief  my biggest wish  in reality  i just want the pain to stop  why is everything so difficult  sure  you would tell me to go get therapy  go get tested by a psychologist or something  as if that advice means anything  you want to label us  as if everyone feels the same thing  people like this are the same  in some ways  sure  they are  but most people don t want to die  they want it to stop  what  exactly  do they want to stop  people  people are predictable  what other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts  even good people turn bad  everyone is bad  even me  people tell you to talk to others about these feelings  that it will help  but only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand  and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to  is that really a good thing  to relate  in wanting to die  back to my point  what can people do  i can t call myself depressed  because i m not sad all the time  i can t say i have anxiety  because i m not anxious all the time  it goes on  the point of this paragraph is to say  don t tell people to ask for advice  or say that you understand what they are going through  i always tell people what i m going through  they brush it off  talking about it can help  but only for the right people  for people like me  i don t exactly know if i have specific mental health to blame everything on  i m just feeling like this  that s all     x   b     x   b   for all the comments  im sorry i cant reply to them all but i will try to when i get round to it  but i want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future  please feel free to pm me  ill always reply  didnt realise this would blow up  but it is nice to know people feel the same way  i hope you find some sort of comfort in that as i do  stay safe   someone shared this link with me  if you want you can read it    https   theoutline com post      living with passive suicidal ideation zd   zi  b  wq r  https   theoutline com post      living with passive suicidal ideation zd   zi  b  wq r  ,1

isn t it weird to explain that you d rather feel sadness than nothing at all   it s so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many   i used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like   i think when i feel   better     it s not really like happiness   it s more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness   normality   i keep trying to force tears just to feel something   as dramatic as it sounds     but nothing happens  i can never cry naturally   i have to force myself   and the minute i stop focusing on it   the tears dry up oops    i feel isolated from everyone   like i can see my family   friends interacting but there s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense   all communication is too much effort   let alone movement   the feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable   i kinda prefer it than being happy i guess   happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable   everything good and bad in life comes from feelings   ,1
anybody feel like this   does anybody feel like they have to kill themselves to prove to people that they actually have depression and they aren t crying out for attention   ,1
doesnt it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time  i feel like nothing makes me happy  even when im laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit i still just feel incredibly upset and depressed  sometimes i actually feel worse  ,1

i feel beyond suicidal anybody else have this  suicide just feels completely pointless  infact  everything does  people try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to  be practical  and to  stop being dramatic  when youre not even showing any emotion the first place and all youre doing is lying there like a dead fish  killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that cant be fixed and even then suicide doesnt do anything except cause more pain to people  not even dying seems appealing anymore  at this point i just want to lie in bed and sleep  and keep sleeping  and keep sleeping  but i cant even be afforded the option of giving up  if i do  people tell me im selfish and stick pitchforks in me  i ask why and the best answer i get for  keeping going  is just  because you have to   and then people get angry when you press them further because they cant really think of a reason either  its just a blind desperation to survive we all have  like were just that important  that need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me  and so has the need to die  im stuck here in this place and all i want to do is block it all out  sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed to piss  we keep going because we have to  but nobody ever tells me why   edit  wow    k upvotes and an award  this is the first post ive ever made here on this sub and youve all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much  im glad so many people get it  i knew i wasnt the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone  i wish i could thank each one of you individually  thanks for being there reddit     ,1

i hate when people say  life will get better  i want life to be better not to get better  i want it  better  now  i dont want to wait for fate  im done waiting    besides the future is uncertain  it could very well get better or it could get even worse  and most of the times it may be out of your reach  ,1
am i the worst human being in the world for secretly hoping the coronavirus would take my mum so that i can kill myself without affecting anyone too dear to me  its such a selfish selfish thought and im trash for even thinking it  obviously i do not want my mum to suffer through it or for her life to be taken  but right now shes the only reason im still alive and i feel so trapped  im just wishing for any way out now                                                                                                                                                                                                    edit  thank you to everyone who gave so much advice and support and shared their experiences  i really appreciate your thoughts and i really hope anyone feeling the same way could take something nice away from this too ,1
i wish i could re do my teenage years without my anxiety and depression and in a different time period  prior to the internet being a thing    s or   s maybe  i spent my entire childhood locked away in my room with a glowing blue screen  ,1
i ruined my own life it s no ones fault but my own  i pushed people away and now i have no friends  i don t even know how to socialize anymore  i m too anxious to even try and make friends  but at the same time i don t want any friends  i like being a loner  but i know that i m never gonna be happy because there s no one to love me and i certainly don t love myself  i don t even know where it went wrong years back  but i wish i could beat the fuck out of my younger self for socially withdrawing myself because i ll never recover  ,1
i feel like depression has made me less smart i dont think about much anymore  the things i do think about are unimportant   because of this  i dont have anything intelligent to say  im not funny or clever or smart  i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this   i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so one dimensional and dull  ,1
memory loss from depression so recently my depression has hit a low point as i am in the middle of switching my meds since i saw a psychiatrist this week and she diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety and is worried about me  anywho  my memory has been bad  like  i cant remember what i am doing sometimes or past    minutes of anything someone tells me  can anyone else relate  right now  i dont know if its derealization but i just dont feel present  i feel like i am alive but not here  i cant remember anything and it is driving me crazy  i would rather be sad  unmotivated  and depressed rather than suffering from memory loss  ,1
it s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves i guess i ve just been living like this so long it s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all ,1

do you ever just lie in bed  thinking how different your life could be and imagining all the possibilities instead of actually going out there and doing them  i do  i know its a lot easier than getting stuff done and i wouldnt be able to get half the stuff i want done done anyways  ,1
why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you  seriously  i can t tell even if i ve known them forever  do they like me  or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don t  today is a bad day and i m just obsessing over everything  ,1
does anyone else just think  kill yourself  every time you do something wrong  i make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so i end up thinking the words  kill yourself  dozens of times a day  it s like a reflex at this point  i m not actually going to kill myself but it s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down  i m afraid i ll start saying it out loud or something ,1
i wish suicide wasn t harmful to other people  if i could take my life  and know that it would      inconsequential to others  i think the decision would be easy  if it was just lights out for me and no one else is hurt or lives disrupted at all  i would do it right now  ,1
you ever get asked the  where do you see yourself in five years   question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because  probably not alive  is the knee jerk response  first off  what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway   what do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question   that im indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that im ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit   fuckin hell  man   undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it  all depends on the person   i suppose im the sloth suicidal   ive tip toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and i cant help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time   yet  when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is  well  dont be alive anymore   the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone i leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint i have for seeing myself out of my life   sounds rather counter intuitive  but id rather my last thoughts be more  you gave it a go  youre not doing anything wrong  you do you  kiddo  and less  hey  youre a tremendous asshole for this  i hope you know that    i can comfortably say im not doing it tonight  or tomorrow  or this year or even the next  but i genuinely feel like thats how im going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit   dont even really know what im trying to say here  but do you ever feel like this   like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of  but for whatever fucking reason just cant make any sort of move   afterthought   cant help but laugh that when driveling on in this post i look up at the browser tab and it says submit to depression     haha  fuckin a  ,1
i have no passion for anything anymore i don t enjoy anything anymore  i dread waking up and i can t wait to go home to sleep just so i don t have to think anymore  i use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all i do is work  see my boyfriend  study and maybe see my friends once a week  my life is so meaningless i feel as if it isint going anywhere and i just feel so empty inside  i use to enjoy activities i use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever i do i can t enjoy   i don t know how to get out of this sometimes i can sit for hours just staring at a wall i am so dead inside ,1
i really miss feeling joy and euphoria i wish i still felt that full body joy euphoria like i did as a kid  waking up on christmas morning  making eye contact with a boy i had a crush on during class  playing video games with my dad and winning the level  everything feels so dulled and flat now  it makes me wonder what the point is  i m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it  the closest i get to joy is when i m shitfaced drunk    antidepressants sorta help but i don t want to be taking them forever  plus the side effects are crappy  i guess i will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son  watching him do things for the first time   edit  please stop suggesting drugs ,1
i wish to be dead  not to die  this statement makes no sense to someone who doesnt suffer from depression  i wish i was never born  i wish that this would all end  but i cant bring my self to end it  i want to not exist  but for some reason dying scares me  not death whatever lies beyond i will deal with when i get there  but its the step between suffering and non existence that scares me  ,1
sharing something i m proud of for a chance the past two weeks i have cooked almost daily instead of eating fast food  i ve kept my house clean  showered regularly  and i ve done all of my work for grad school  even some of it way ahead of time   i usually don t say i m proud of myself but i think i need to say it today  ,1

nobody wants to deal with negative people you really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers  friends  and family  if you re not always a ray of sunshine  you become the negative  depressed person who is no fun to be around  at the end of the day  no one really gives a shit about what you re dealing with  if you re not being positive and smiling  no matter the reason  they have a problem with you   i wish there wasn t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing  it is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor  ,1
what if i don t have depression and i m just a lazy worthless useless human being who does absolutely nothing i m just using resources undeservingly that should be reserved for more worthy people tbh  ,1
depression has made me so stupid i can t concentrate  i don t focus  i miss the picture of concepts  overall i m just disengaged and demoralized  i live the same repetitive day over and over  dropped out of school for the  th time  can t keep jobs  lose passion  i m comically miserable  i don t even feel like a real human anymore  i used to be articulate blah blah but nope  at this point i just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that s next to me until i have to move  no wonder my brain is rotting  hell i can t even get through reading paragraphs on reddit  i generally don t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards  same fights ,1
two days ago i was feeling amazing  the best i ever have and now i am miserable and want to die  wtf brain  the last few days i felt on top of the world  had boundless energy  felt my depression was completely cured  was so happy  life was so beautiful  every thing was so beautiful  i was planning days out  chatting to people more than i ever do  making jokes  laughing  felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe   now im lying in bed tired and miserable because i painted my shed door and made a mess of it so im obviously a worthless human being  the idea of following through with any of those plans i made fills me with dread    i wish the happiness would actually last  ,1
does anyone else feel like they either cant or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldnt complain  i often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how i feel when im upset  ,1
daily cycle  ,1
i really dont want to die  i actually really like life  i just dont like my life  i think the world is beautiful  there are so many amazing things to see and do  and seemingly countless possibilities  too many for a single lifetime  i think people are amazing  and the shitty terrible people dont prevent me from appreciating the good ones  whom i consider to be the majority   to me  life is wonderful  except i dont like  my  life  i wish i could be somebody different  somebody less mediocre  someone more attractive  more intelligent  more motivated  more adventurous  and more knowledgeable about what im looking for in life  im    and all i can think about is everything i have missed out on and will miss out on in life  i wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else  i dont want to stop playing  i just wish i could start a new game  ,1
warning  watch out for pms pushing religion    update   we are aware this person has been pm ing everyone whos participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions   i hope it goes without saying that were not   one of the people who let us know what theyre up to used the phrase  persecution complex  and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that     after warnings and explanations  they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules  after we resorted to banning the account  something we very rarely do here  they announced that they were going to escalate their rule breaking behaviour   the sort of person who claims to want to help  but ignores a communitys rules while claiming to want to follow them is  in our regretful opinion  exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable ops need to be protected from     if you received any pms as follow up to a comment you made on this post  please click  report  on all of them as this brings this persons behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins   thanks                                                                                 weve had reports of pm ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom weve had to take action against for persistently trying to  save  people in this sub   their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because its a way to find a  community    this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic   dont fall for it     edit   i should have worded that last sentence better   were not saying that all religion is  notorious  or anything   were saying that  this particular person  is being deceptive and manipulative  and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way thats representative of the worst types of cultish  religion    so our issue is fundamentally not with religion  but the misuse of it    ,1
makes friends    get close  really get to know them    alienate them slowly with your issues    get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime    repeat this pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me  i dont still have any friends from then now  hell  i barely have any friends left from   years ago   im just so sick of it  i thought id broken this cycle  but its rearing its head again  im being told to just make new friends  but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and im right back here  wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment  isolation  not belonging  etc  all over again   it just reinforces for me that i dont belong on this planet  that as soon as somebody knows the real me  our relationship  whatever its nature  is on borrowed time  that im just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups i never quite seem to fit into  spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next  until finally  almost mercifully  it ends  just   why bother  if nobody can love me for the real me  and i cant for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept  whats the point   edit  thanks for the silver guys  i wasnt expecting this to be so well received  ,1

my therapist committed suicide last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i don t know how to cope  i feel so alone  this wasn t just some therapist off the street  he was highly educated  well respected  and worked with a few institutions  selfishly  i feel hurt and abandoned  everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like  a close friend died  get a new friend  but so much trust was broken  i don t want to open up to a new therapist  the thought that keeps running through my mind is  if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn t get better  what hope do i have   and also  selfishly   how could he    i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons  but it feels so unfair  like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed  thanks for listening   ,1

my girlfriend died hey everybody   i m writing this to vent    about   years ago my girlfriend died  she died on the night of june          from a car accident  there was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road  she swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch   we met each other when we were    going on    years old back in  th grade  of course  for a while we were just close friends  but eventually it turned into more  we met each other randomly i would say  we just happened to be in the same class  from  th to  th grade  we hung out all the time  mainly during school   after  th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school  we still hung out with each other every weekend though  i would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other    fast forward to senior year of high school  at this point we had been dating for some time  both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating  we wanted to go for film  photography  we loved each other very much  we were honestly just right for each other  we rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other   we graduated from high school in may  unfortunately  right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons  but then she was gonna be back soon for college  senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit  when she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night   on the night before june   th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour  she really hated living far away from me   especially right after graduating  on the   th we didn t txt each other all day because we were busy  later in the day i waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone  i txted her around   but she didn t respond  i just assumed she was busy  a little after   i received a phone call from her mom  i was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd  i cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice  it must ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on  eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died  i remember initially freezing up  but i could feel tears running down my face  the pain  anxiety and guilt was massive    that night i could not sleep at all  the next night i slept maybe a few hours  my life took a sharp turn when she died  i was so much more lively and joyful   i just became dull and lifeless  i felt lifeless as well  this is kinda random  but i never grew my hair out growing up  it was always buzzed short  but when she died i kinda gave up and grew it out for   years  my life spiraled out of control for about two years  i became a nihilist  i lost joy in life  i don t wanna go down that rabbit hole though   fast forward to now  i ve really came a long ways since then  i didn t go to college right after high school  i couldn t find the motivation to  after about two years i got myself together and attended college though  right now in my life i m almost about to graduate from college  not in film  photography  but i think she would be proud of me   i wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that i lost someone so important  losing her was like losing half of my being    lately i ve been thinking of her   wishing she was by my side as i graduate  i wish she was here     it feels good to write this though    for about three years i had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend  but lately i ve felt the desire to do so  i hope someday i find someone i can love as much as i loved her   thanks for reading          ,1

anyone else have semi suicidal thoughts on a regular basis  i m not saying gun to my head thoughts  i mean like  driving down the road and once in a while my brain says  just turn into the opposite lane  it ll look like an accident  but then i just shake it off  or shaving my legs and think  just cut  bleed out  it s so easy  but i never actually act on these things  they ve just become a part of my life  i feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that i have to constantly argue with  it s exhausting   ,1
i hate being alone  yet i want to be alone  id push someone away even if i wanted them to stay  because i feel everyone is better off without me  ,1
we only see those who get better aka survivorship bias  we hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better  but there s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill  i m tired of hearing  it will get better  just look at what happened to me   because it hasn t  why should i continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up  i call it as i see it  if my mental state has deteriorated  even after years of treatment  then i probably won t end up as a survivor  ,1
the closest ill ever get to the life i want is my sims game self pity  during a pandemic  ground breaking  ,1
all i want is not to wake up tomorrow i dont enjoy anything anymore  the hobbies i used to do just no longer interest me  the older i get  the less i enjoy talking to people  i havent talked to the people i used to call friends in several months  all i want is to go to sleep tonight and not wake up in the morming  so i can just be done pretending to be a happy  normal person  i dont want to kill myself because my parents and people would be sad  but i hate that the only thing i keep going for is so other people dont have to bury me  i wish i could get sick and die  or get hit by a car  or anything that would let me just be done  ,1

millions of years of evolution among millions of species on this planet  all with a single common instinct within them    survive  and here my brain is telling me everyday to kill myself  if that doesnt prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us  then i dont know what will  i really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down  that too by people whom you would give your life for  fuck this shit  i hope i was born heartless and emotionless so i didnt care about these kind of people but i still love them even after they refused to help me  i hope i die a miserable death  it would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me    if i cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself  i promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this   ,1
depression will have you saying  im tired  cause  im sad  doesnt seem to explain how much it drains you   ,1
i really thought suicidal thoughts were for idiots and pussies but well    when i first heard of suicide and suicidal thoughts i wondered who the fuck does that  now that fuck is me  never knew i would be the one wanting to die and postpones my suicide each day  ,1
im a lazy  pitiful    year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life  in debt  no degree  lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything  title says it all  my girlfriend broke up with me recently  she said i was a man child and she needed an actual man   im old now  i look back and i dont remember ever growing up  i have   dwis  an entry level job still  no college degree and i live at my moms house with her fiance who i cant stand   any money i make i either spend it on video games or shopping and i racked up over    k in debt   i dont have a point or goal in my life and i feel like im already dying    i could have been something good in my life but here i am alone again  every single woman ive been with has left me    i cant fucking sustain or follow through with anything  i didnt get a degree  i dont finish the projects i start  every idea ive had has never completeled  ive never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post  i dont see any real will to live   id never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and i care about them way too much to hurt them  so instead im just floating through life  barely surviving  with no retirement  ill probably die while still working as an old man   im a pitiful    year old man and i just wanted to let everyone know  i dont have any reason to move forward and even if i did  id never follow through with it anyway   edit  to everyone young reading this  just try to promise me youll at least go to school and get a degree  not to impress anyone like most egomaniacs  but just so you have a good job and can get your own place and be proud of yourself  you dont want to end up like be  i promise you that  ,1
is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate  i try to keep my mental health issues to myself  i dont want to tell others because i feel like an attention whore  and ive been accused of that before  what about you  ,1
i miss the old me i ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like  i ve forgotten what it s like to actually have a passion for life  these last few months have been a blur  i can only really recall a few days in detail  i miss the old me  she had so much potential  she had so many friends  she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed  she looked healthy  and prettier  now i can t even move out of bed  i just lie there waiting for someone to text me  but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or i ve pushed them away  i don t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch netflix now  my housemates don t even notice when i don t leave my room for a week  even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery  i used to be so full of life  but that seems like an eternity away  such a distant memory now  it feels like i have no one now and i have no energy to even move  let alone do anything slightly productive  every single thing overwhelms me the cat wouldn t eat the food i gave him today because he s so fussy and i just burst into tears  i m so tired  i want out  everything used to be so different   edit  i never expected this post to blow up so much and i m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages  i m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet  but i will soon  know i m appreciative of every single pm and comment  thank you for making me feel less alone  this website is very special ,1
what does a person even do all day  i dont get it  i have so many things i could do right now   exercise  listen to music  watch a movie  anything   but i have no motivation  its not that i want be lazy  no  its that i have no inclination to do anything in particular and that i know ill most likely feel disappointed if i do force myself to do anything because it wont be fulfilling and all ill be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things  i dont want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing  but im too tired to be outside doing something  im just cycling between the same sites i check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different   what does a person even do all day  i dont get it  ,1
anyone else feel like theyre just scraping through each day to make it home and return to your vicious cycle habits  every day i go to work barely doing anything and get home excited for the thought of being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room   does anyone else feel too drained from daily routines to ever break the cycle  ,1
who else envies people without depression  i wish i wasnt born with this de habilitating disease  i find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive  anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it  for instance  i got promoted at work but its so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position  other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but its just a chore for me  and when i try to do it its just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so i go off and do leisurely things  anyone have any tips to combat this  ,1
the question i hate most   are you okay   because the answer is always  no  but if i say  no   they always ask me whats wrong  if you can see through my happy facade im nowhere near capable of telling you whats wrong without breaking down  if i am somehow capable of telling you  you wont understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes  you will always see my answer to your question written on my face    ,1
high functioning depression is so hard for people to understand people are only just starting to understand depression but its usually depression thats making you stay in bed all the time or not eat       i always feel like people think im lazy or i even question whether i have depression  i exercise regularly  go to uni  eat well  cook a lot of fresh meals for myself  socialise and work    but i had to cut my hours because i had a breakdown  i find it hard to make it into uni  my attendance is awful  ill flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house  i have days where im like a zombie  everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day  i feel heavy and i kind of feel like im trying to run through deep water   but nobody really expects this from a depressed person  it seems like i get through life just fine because i do get through life but its actually much harder than it seems   edit  didnt expect this to get the amount of attention it has  im reading every comment and im trying to reply to all of them  thank you for responding  feels good to know this isnt as uncommon as i thought  hope other people find comfort in that too   edit    still reading every comment  just wanted to share something that might be helpful  i downloaded an app called moodnotes  cost about     you can log your mood each day  which is useful if youre trying to map your mood changes  and identify thinking traps etc  im not advertising or anything i dont even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me  its nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day  ,1
i had to fill out one of those depression tests today    and i scored in the severe range  this lead to the following exchange between my doctors and i   doctor  this is a really high score   me  thank you   thankfully  i saw the funny side it in its awkwardness   and i hope you guys do too  sometimes  the only way to cope with how terrible things are is to laugh   stay strong  fam  ,1
dae say  im sick  instead of  im depressed  because you know you wont get taken seriously otherwise  its ironic that depression is an illness in the first place  yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone   if anyone knows where i can get this  snap out of it  medication ive heard is so effective  i would be so grateful if you let me know where i can buy it from  ,1
i never realized it  but i always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because i never wanted them to go through what im going through right now  funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me   looking back on it  its kind of funny  no one wants to be around a sad person  so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone  the charade works so well that no one would actually think youre suffering inside  a ridiculous catch     isnt it   i was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on   and now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack  revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath  completely blank and hollow    its as if my face has been wiped away  withered to dust  ,1
i hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you and this compounds the depression   not only is childhood trauma  one in which your parents   who  should  have represented all that was good   were in fact  evil  one of the worst possible causes of depression   but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you  get over it   or  seek help     as if trauma is expected  but not ignoring it is not expected  youre supposed to conform to this place  to accept trauma as normal  if not something you  do   normally   and so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what its like to be depressed  ,1
i spent my whole life walking on eggshells  trying not to offend  to please everyone  now i feel like the most uninteresting person alive  the worst part is that now i have this ingrained in my behaviour  if someone says something that i disagree with  i try to twist my views to agree with theirs    im so worried about seeming normal  that i take everything someone says seriously  which makes me look like an idiot when i inevitably take seriously every joke that gets thrown at me   when i examine my past behaviour  all the jokes seem obvious and all the twisted opinions seem stupid  but i cant help it  the only thing that brings out my true self is alcohol  but i dont want to go down that road   i just wish i could be as confident sober as i am when drunk  slightly drunk  ive never been so drunk i couldnt control my behaviour  or puked and couldnt stand up straight   everything feels so natural  so relaxed  i feel like a man instead of a mouse  ,1
i have no reason to be depressed  compared to other people  i should not be depressed  i grew up in a loving  privileged family and i turn out like this  how does that even happen  i feel so guilty  ,1
i dont know how much longer i can live like this i hate not having anyone to share my thoughts with  someone to watch movies with  someone i can go to when i feel down  someone who cares about what i did yesterday   nothing matters when youve got no one to share your life with  it doesnt matter how pretty the sunset is  how exciting the movie is  how great the concert is  how tasty the food is if you dont have anyone to enjoy the moment with  a friend  a family member  a significant other  it doesnt matter  i just wish i had  someone  who really cared  i have family  i have friends  but they only make me feel more alone  ,1
my friend killed himself he was     i grew up with him and he was like my little brother  he was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes  he was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh  he killed himself   he didnt let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day  he was exhausted and he only saw one option and now im trying to pick up the pieces of myself  i am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and i cant breathe  i feel too much while feeling too little   i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years  but this  this is   overwhelming  it is excruciating  it is numbing  it is agonizing and yet it is impassive   i feel everything and i feel nothing    i dont want to die  but i dont know how to live   im fighting every day  im pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast  every day is a struggle right now  but im fighting  keep fighting  friends  ,1
im not ignoring you  i just forgot about my own existence  this is truly how i feel when people ask me why im not texting calling them back  ,1
do you hate complaining to people because you feel it will make them hate you because you are telling them your problems   ,1
my depression is cured well bois  i finally decided to talk to my mom about my depression and she has the cure  yelled at me until i scribbled on a paper for    seconds cause that s what she says i ve gotta do every day to fix my depression  hopefully this simple neat trick will help you all too  cheers  bois  ,1
sometimes when i pretend to be happy i actually think my mood gets better its really weird  my friends in school have no idea about my depression and i like to keep it that way  so i always try my best to hide it and i smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes  not very often  but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when i have a second to myself but its just really weird  maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy  sounds dumb but hey  trying to grasp every little straw here   edit  its crazy reading how many people can relate  thought i was being quite alone with that  thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts  i guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole  that you seriously try anything to make it go away  even if it means  needing to force yourself through   hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good  only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days ,1

anyone elses depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes  i was doing great all summer  wouldnt even say i was depressed just a few weeks ago  but with the clouds  coldness  late sunrises  and early sunsets  i can feel things starting to spiral  particularly  i seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night  my schedule is all shifted  and im basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times  my mood is reflecting my poor sleep   i dont know if its sad or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm  but i dont like it   i think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair  body pain  muscle tension  sleep disturbances  it always seems like this stuff comes first  my mood issues are more insidious  im generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved  and dont tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another  so it sneaks up on me  a slow  creeping apathy and anhedonia  i tend to get pretty deep into it before i realize how bad things have gotten   think im going back on the zoloft  ,1

i just want to be passionate about something again its been so fucking long  i try to find a hobby  a goal  a fucking anything  but i just cant  best case scenario i put a lot of effort into it for a week or two before i finally give up faking it  i mean i literally force myself to do things hoping ill grow passionate about them  or at least enjoy them enough to look forward to doing them    but i cant  and i dont know how to make it better     years old  my youngest kids are starting to get to the point where they dont need me as much anymore which is good for them  i fear the day tho when i dont even have them to give me some purpose  living out the rest of my days as a functional vegetable  pretty sure thats where im headed    rant ,1

my family searched my room while i was in the hospital i don t know if anyone will even read this  i just need to tell someone what is happening  here s the story a little over a week ago i admitted my self into the hospital because i did not feel i could keep my self safe any longer  the next day brother was  looking for cough drops  at least that the excuse they used  and he looked in the box where i keep all of my sh tools in   he then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after i was dead but had never intended for anyone to read  i didn t even want them to read them even if i had killed myself  he freaked out and showed them to my sister  who showed my dad  they then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet  they took everything out of my desk  read though all of my notebooks  this happen last wednesday and they didn t tell me until sunday  i saw my parents   times between the time they found the notebooks and sh stuff  they said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me  i am really devastated that they read something so personal that i never wanted them to read  now i don t know what to do  all i ve done since i found out is cry  i feel worse now then when i went into the hospital  thanks for reading  i don t have anyone to talk to about this  i just really need a place to rant   ,1
im staying alive because of my cats  i have two cats that live with me right now  they know when im sad or having a breakdown they come over and comfort me  ive been at my breaking point the last couple of days but they literally lay next to me at night making sure im okay  they are keeping me alive at this point and i love them so much  ,1
im smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that i have something to do with my hands  i lost interest in music which always been my passion  i spent the last   days browsing youtube  alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings  i should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me  my near future is uncertain and i feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself  i have to leave my flat in the end of the month  i will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until i find something to do with my life  in november  it will be one year since i havent been intimate with a guy and it makes me feel like i am loosing my femininity   i dont know who i am  dont know what i want  barely know how to get the things i need  ,1
fuck all of this im stuck at home  i have nothing to do  i have no friends  i have no reason to go outside  all my family does is yell at me for the littlest things  especially my mother   my physical condition is worse than ever before  every part of my body hurts  as soon as i start to break down or cry  i get yelled at even more  i feel like im isolated in a place that might as well be hell  i have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy   edit  thank you guys so much for all the kind words  and thank you to whoever gave this post gold  i feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles  it may seem hopeless now  it certainly does feel that way for me   but well get through this together  love all of you    ,1
how do you guys find the motivation to do literally anything  i have no hope  i see no future and cant push myself to do the most basic of acts  e g  brushing my teeth   how do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds  how do you find the motivation to do the things you want need to do  ,1

i almost killed myself tonight i know nobody will read this     i was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near      chance of killing me  stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips  but i never drank it  something stopped me and im not sure what    but nothings changed  i still want to die and everything is still shitty   the only person i ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when i opened up about my mental health  just completely abandoned me  everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts  i keep reaching out  hoping shell reply to me and be friendly one day  but on the rare occasion she replies its  i dont want to deal with you    find someone else   etc  i fucking have nobody else  everything ive tried has failed  getting nowhere im therapy    i just want this to end so badly  why cant she care about me  about my life  i just need a friend in her  fuck my life so bad  ,1

 you re mexican  depression is a white people thing  we don t have time for that  yup    this is what one of my closest friends said to me when i opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year i actually tried to kill myself after years of self harm  i don t think i have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly  it just makes me laugh now when i hear some people s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression  like damn lol  anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this  if so share it  i m sure we could all use a chuckle or two   ,1
life is a chore having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of  i have to do this all over again   have to go to school  college  university or even work  were stuck in our imaginative sociable  unsociable life  there are no questions to our daily duties  as were following the propaganda of what others expect us to be    just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species  we all supposedly  have a purpose  to fill  but what if you dont fit that category  where do we go from there   in my situation  i personally think i am not fit for this world  i suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health  similarly  my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything  i have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation  i lost the one person i loved deeply and now she is with someone else  theres nothing and no one left to live for   i hate going to sleep at every night knowing ill wake up again  doing the same thing over  i hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain  i hate life and i wish i could give up and end everything  ,1
a stranger hugged me yesterday i was crying yesterday talking to my professors because i was having an awful day  and this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn t realize we were having a conversation  he felt really bad and gave me a hug and left  he was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better  ,1
it pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice it just isnt  and not because i say it isnt  it just isnt  i try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better  coping strategies just calm me down  smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable  i dont even know   ,1
slowly  i didnt realize i was already killing myself first i killed the athlete  there wasnt much of him to begin with so it was easy  at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days  he even joined some after school group of friends to play with  that didnt really go anywhere   next i killed the gamer  he was easy to kill too because of the need  the corporate life taking much of my time didnt leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight  his antics still surface every now and then  making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors  i just stuffed his mouth with career dreams  he didnt really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable   next i killed the party boy  this one  took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two  i had to kill his connections with his friends  i had to starve him of his former social saturation   and in a way that he wont easily recourse back  i made his friends believe he didnt need the contact  that he was happy  the party boy slowly lost his spirit  thats when i went for the jugular to end his pain   next i killed the musician  i almost didnt like killing him  hes the most recent one  and the most difficult one to get rid of  he has support your see  all the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears  plays  or sings a song  gives him enough strength to push back  hes even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces  but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country   that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab  it was easy enough from then on    im just afraid  that eventually  i might kill the writer too  and when i do  i dont really know whats left   im actually surprised to realize that ive been hurting myself without physically doing so  ive lost more of myself in the past few months than i ever had in years  and im not making any more of me than what i already have    ps  i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago  and putting what ive been doing in words  has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain  myself  throughout the past year  i still get spans of time where i feel like nothing  where i feel afraid of being nothing that id rather just lose my life  but remember all youve been through  things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless  you matter  theres a value to everything youve done and accomplished  so lets all hold on and hold tight      edit  thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger  and to everybody whos commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you  im surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are is going through  losing  parts of themselves  lets all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do  and for those who feel empty   its never too late to find yourself  lets all fight for it  even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning    ,1
people are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help  but you can literally be crying in school public and people will just stare at you and not do anything and then when you kill yourself they say they couldn t have done anything to stop it  and they say they re here for anyone who wants to talk  that lasts about a week   ,1
anybody else sick of the  i feel the same  you get everytime you try to discuss your depression with someone  then that person tries to turn it      and talks about stuff that makes him sad  and when we take our lives people say  why didnt they speak  because no body is ever going to listen  ,1

is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene   waking up super difficult  ever since the diagnosis  it s hard to get out of bed  including showering  socialising  walking  i m not going to even call it exercise   vacuuming  combing  etc    my dad thinks that it s laziness  he says getting out of bed   working out can lessen depression  ,1
i just want to vanish and be forgotten for the rest of eternity  if there was button to erase all traces of my existence including being in peoples memories  i would have smack the shit out of that  ,1
please dont tell me  it will get better  sometimes i dont want to hear  it will get better  because i dont see it and i dont believe it  sometimes i just want someone to sit with me in silence or to listen to me and comfort me or just laugh with me  i dont know if anyone else feels like this but i do   and also i just want one day where i dont want to die   edit  i most likely wont reply to many people but i am reading them all  edit  if you are being rude and disrespectful to others on this post i will respond with a prompt f    you and you will be free to take full offense and i hope you leave  anybody else you are doing great  sooo another edit  umm    i might begetting suspended because i was trying to get a rude user away from you guys because he was being a bully and saying mean hurtful things and he took this a verbal abuse  idk when if i will or how long  i just want you all to knoe that i love you all and you have lifted my spirit  ,1
cant because im depressed  depressed because i cant  anyone else feel this    cant work because of reasons raised by depression  depressed because i cant work   alone  no friends  no girls ever interested in me because of depression  depressed because i cant have those things   countless more ,1
anybody wish they were   years old again and could start their life over  i have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that i wish i could take back  my life is in shambles and i wish i could just magically start over  my laziness is the death of me and i constantly fight demons in my head  it would be much better to just cease to exist at this point  that seems very peaceful  life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting    i used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in       years ill be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse  everytime i think i hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless  i wont get into specifics because there are too many to list but i am starting to feel like a pathetic failure  i always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but i just ended up becoming a no life bum  i wish i would just die while sleeping sometimes  waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world  just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point  i wish i didnt feel this way but i do  ill end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system  even if one person reads this ill he happy that i got this out there and could share my depression and rage which i kept bottled inside of me for so long  keep kicking yall hopefully we can all be happy one day  ,1
i want to be excited about life again i had a dream of a time where i was genuinely happy with my life  i saw a lot of people that i cared about and it felt very nostalgic and i felt really happy  then i woke up and realized none of those people are in my life anymore or at least on the same basis as they used to be  i went through today with nobody speaking to me  and now im about to go to bed without accomplishing anything because i felt really depressed  bonus points for not eating anything in    days  don t really know the point of this post tbh  just felt like i needed it somewhere  update  thank you all for the love and advice  i feel a little better and motivated and honestly expected this post to get lost in the sub  this community is amazing and i m really grateful     update  ate something  nice ,1
i don t want to die i just want to cease to exist  ,1
i m so caught up in my web of depression that i sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living  it just seems so strange to me that most people don t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death    like while they re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there  or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them  do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think  what a nice tree that is  instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from   how is it possible that some people just don t want to die  not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive  it makes me feel so guilty for all the times i ve wished to get cancer so i can die without having to do anything  i wish i could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so i can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die  ,1
you ever wish you didnt have any family so you wouldnt feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself i think about killing myself fairly often but i dont think i could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days i wish that i was just alone and no one was around to care so i could just do it  ,1
i m out hi guys    i just wanted to let you all know i feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub  i have gotten a lot of support here  got some good advice and made a great friend    whenever things go south again  i ll know i have this safe space to return to   thank you all  and best of luck  you can do this    edit  i thought you guys might want to know what kind of things i tried and what worked  i took   different kinds of antidepressants  im now on paroxetine and they seem to work  ive tried therapists and thats not my jam  i spent   days in a psych ward after my overdose and i hated it there  other patients loved it though   the thing that worked most for me was reading  i read furiously happy by jenny lawson   times  and thats the book that helped me most  also  the tao of pooh  im not religious   and books about being introverted because it made me realize im not crazy  and sometimes  i would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv  i keep a bullet journal now  playing with colours and just writing down   or   things i have to do each day  do the laundry  but not fold it  and cook dinner  stuff like that  and talk  and if you think that you dont have anyone to talk to  were here  and im here  pm me  i promise ill reply  ,1
my biggest fear  after vulnerability  is that i will go unloved once people know me for who i really am as a high functioning depressed person  i don t know which is an act the depression or the coping  ,1
does anyone feel like theyre just overreacting and destroying their life intentionally even tho now ive seen a psychiatrist i still caught myself thinking  why dont you just start being normal   like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isnt that hard why the hell cant i do it    i would hate myself forever if im jsut destroying my life because im living with a victim mindset  ,1
anyone have trouble planning for the future and being impulsive because you think youll kill yourself eventually anyways   ,1
anyone cry at the sight of normal families  it started when i was quite young  i remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father  i remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up  today i was at work and saw a mother cuddling her daughter and she said  youre squishing me  and the mother replied  thats because you are so squishable and i love you  that shit made me need to close for five minutes  ,1
today im finally throwing away my suicide note ive been a better state of mind this past year  but i think this is the day that i finally commit to it   im not going back again  i made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery  and i can do it again if i end up back where i was   i hope  if you read this and are suffering yourself  that you see this as evidence that no matter how long youve felt this way  recovery is always a possibility   much love x ,1
sometimes i wish i could get killed so people wouldnt be mad that i killed myself  has anyone else felt this way  sorry if this is the wrong place  i dont think suicide watch is the proper place since i dont necessarily want to commit suicide  i just want to cease living   i feel like no matter what i cant escape the demons i have  no matter how well im doing  my mind is always like  the fuck  get back in line   no matter what  theyll always come back up and ill be in my room alone at nearly   in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me   even then it doesnt even really matter if theyre mad or not  id be dead     edit to add  thank you everyone for responding  you all truly helped calm me down  now that ive gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights  i feel better       that too  has passed  this too  shall pass       if any of you need an ear  or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on  id love to be there for you  shoot me a pm anytime    ,1
i feel alone when nobody texts me but when they do i just dont wanna answer  it happens all the time  ,1
anyone elses depression made worse by the way the world is  im constantly so angry that i have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living  which im not even interested in doing   im angry im in a major that i hate and that the fields i was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo  im angry im going to have to work    hours a day   days a week in a job i dont like  im angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i wont like  ill get shit benefits and    days vacation a year  so for the next    years i get to be miserable with the exception of    days out of the year when i can travel which is the only thing im interested in anymore  probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on youtube making millions for being morons while i have to go to school for   years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off   i get the whole  life isnt fair  thing but i cant stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse  ,1
anyone else get up  get dressed  and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for    minutes trying to figure out why you re even bothering  then the fact that i wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad   ,1
probably no one will read this  but whatever  my heart physically hurts  when i was    i remember the doctors telling my father i would grow out of the depression  because apparently a lot of kids do  but here i am         in a couple of months  and it s the worst it s ever been  it just feels like this constant darkness that i can t run away from  i m so miserable  sometimes there are happy moments in my life  maybe cuz something is funny or whatever  but never happiness over a long period of time  i can t function like a normal adult  my room is disgusting  my body is disgusting  i feel disgusting  i can t get out of bed ever  i just want the suffering to end  i can t handle it anymore  it doesn t help that i have zero friends  i mean literally zero  i have tinder  so i talk to people on there every once in a while  but the conversations are meaningless  i don t understand the point in being here if it means that i m just going to be unhappy the entire time  i mean peoples lives usually have some purpose but i have none  what s the point  i am only still here because i am too much of a pussy to actually end it  but if i could pay someone to kill me i would  i just need it to stop  ,1
does anyone else watch an ungodly amount of youtube videos  its most of what i do in my spare time  i dunno  it just gives me little views into lives i wish i could live instead of my own  ,1
depression prevents you from doing the things you know will make you feel better   ,1

best part of the day is sleeping when night comes  you just lay there in bed thinking of all your stressful problems then suddenly everything goes dark  your conciseness goes into rest  you are no longer aware of whats life or death  your brain is numb  and you seize to exist even for a moment  before start dreaming  you feel so happy like that time when you wer          you wake up at   am ready to repeat your boring routine thats been bothering you for quite a while now but you have no choice but to keep going  ,1
i just miss the days when i d wake up  get right out of bed  shower  then do whatever it was i wanted to do that day  just woke up and this was the first thing that came to my mind  ,1

how do people just accept working     hours a week for the rest of their lives  i know this is just how society works  we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others   the exchange of labor  it seems like most people have just accepted this as reality  they get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money theyve earned working  but i cant seem to do that   the idea of spending more than half my waking hours   days a week doing something i dont want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless  its only saturday  and im already dreading entering a whole new workweek  this feeling gets much worse on sundays  and then during the week  i come home from work and know i have to go back in a matter of hours  and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time i dont have to be working    i feel like i spend   of my   days a week just wishing they were over  thats depressing to me    anyone else feel this way   ,1

went for   am walk in the rain  finally felt alive and free  after     of a bottle of pinot grigio i decided to take my one woman pity party outside  i let the rain fall on my face  i let it soak my sweater  i walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me  i stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face  i held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body  i waked through the park  i got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as i could  like when i was a kid  i spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks  i fucking skipped down the middle of the street  in the rain  without a soul around   and i know i will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day  but i really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys    sorry for the theatrics  the pinot is still working its magic  happy tuesday   edit  just wanted to say how moved i am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted  as hard as it is to believe sometimes  we all deserve to feel that way  today was as hard as any other day  but i know somewhere i have the capacity to feel better  we all do   ,1

just because someone has it worse than you  doesn t mean that your problems don t matter if something upsets you  bothers you  hurts you  makes you uncomfortable  then it matters  just because so and so has problems that seem worse than yours  it doesn t make your issues invalid    it kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life  and the person they re talking to says  well at least it isn t any worse   that makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because  obviously  my life isn t actually  that bad  ,1

   and completely lost ive never posted anything online before so ill try to be succinct   im    male  never married  no kids  on medical leave from my job for depression   im so disappointed in the person ive become   no matter how much i read or do  its like i have not gained any wisdom on managing lifes challenges   i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations   i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking   i managed to work for the past    years  but i couldnt keep up in my current job  hence the medical leave      ive been in therapy for much of the past    years   my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder   i take several antidepressants and im currently two weeks into tms therapy   nothing seems to help   im unbelievably critical of myself   even now  as i write this message  i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit    ive been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written   im even more amazed by the responses   how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice   i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained   i cant imagine giving advice to someone   there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress     im a mess right now   i have lost hope of getting better   i dont exercise  i sleep    hours a day   i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents   nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me   the worst thing is that my ex girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i havent dated since   i have some solid friends that ive known since high school   they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own   i cant seem to learn anything these days   i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things    i cant imagine surviving another    years   i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer   ive no real skills to rely on   i have saved about     k in my    years of work  i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day   i no longer think im capable of having a family   too overwhelming   i would be an awful spouse and father  i dont plan to go back to work   i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life   by then my parents will be gone and i wont hurt them   my siblings and friends will be hurt in the near term but they will be ok in the long run     ive read so much on coping with this disease   but so little spurs me to action   until last year  im was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going  keeping up with job and social occasions   the weed stopped working for me though   now if i smoke  it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse     thanks for reading all this   i love you  ,1

what depression actually looks like  playing a wow vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed   staying up till  am even though you know you have to work at noon   scrolling through your facebook timeline and wondering who these people are   earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food   saying youll quit smoking as you buy another pack   wondering why you still have these problems at      crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship   never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they dont call you  ,1
annus horribilus today is the anniversary of my daughters death  she died in my arms  and i am grateful i could be with her  she was     and we were very close  cut from the same cloth  she had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism  creating the perfect storm that resulted in her death  she made no secret of her desire to die  but her death wasnt suicide  per se  in the year prior to her passing i was diagnosed with esophegal cancer  and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment  nobody expected me to live  and i think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me  during my time in hospital my ex wife  my daughters mother  came to stay with my daughter to care for her  ive since discovered  from reading my daughters reddit  emails and texts  that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time  i demanded to be released from hospital early  as my daughters health had deteriorated  and they made arrangements to get me home  i was unable to speak in more than a whisper  had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but i was happy to be home with my daughter  we spent quality time together  when she died a few weeks later i arranged the funeral and the wake  i couldnt deliver a eulogy  or even toast her life  my daughter had very few friends  partly because of her treatment resistant depression  and partly because she just didnt suffer fools lightly  but the friends she did have she treated like gold  one was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt  and my daughter drove     kms to visit him  and she went back every day for days on end  just as example  none of them could manage to get to her funeral  i have recovered  mostly  now  but i dont know why  i dont want to live  especially after this past year  i am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very  very special daughter  without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness  ,1
does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller  happier  more complex life full of promise  everyone around me seems to be doing better  like they re happier  like they know something i don t  or they ve figured it out  i know everyone has their own problems  but everyone else overcomes theirs  i feel stuck  even when i make progress i feel slow  like i m behind everyone   ,1

anyone else casually want to die all the time  i would probably never commit suicide although ive thought of it a lot  but i get suicidal about the littlest things   somebody ignored my text  wish i was dead because no one cares about me  say something awkward   wish i could jump off a bridge  its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems   ,1
i am really sorry for people who post here and nobody replies  i think it feels like nobody in the world cares  ,1
i think the worst part of being depressed for so long is that not only do you start to believe it s  who you are   the people around you do as well  i am    and have had mental health issues since     i can say at    it started while    it hit scary severe status   so with that age i m around my family and friends because i can t really get away from them     over time it has become normal to them that i never want to do anything  and even though it s true  it hurts  i know it s abnormal and i can t stop it  this  fog  has taken over my personality  i thought i d be happy when people stopped asking me to do things  because i felt bad saying no   but now i don t get invited or included because people just  know   ,1
im going to a mental hospital and now i feel like  im not depressed enough   i feel unmotivated  lonely and like i dont have a goal in life  massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now  ive thought about harming and killing myself multiple times  but lately  since i know im getting hospitalized  i feel like i dont deserve to go there  ive never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and i feel like im taking away a spot in that hospital from someone  whos problems are way worse    i definately know that i have thoughts from time to time  which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal  but they always go away at some point  its so hard for me to know if im depressed  i always feel like i cant say im depressed  because there are probably others  who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems    ,1
every time i wake up from sleeping i m just like  sigh   fuck   or sometimes i ll be doing anything and i stop for a second and i m say under my breath  fuck i hate my life dude   ,1
therapy just made me more aware of how isolated i feel because most people suck at empathy i ve been in therapy for years  in that i ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and i try to deal with it  i spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best  for a depressed person i manage to excel in life   currently dealing with the sting of a breakup  went on vacation to asia and ex broke nc before my trip to wish me well after what i gather was him finding out the grass isn t greener   i m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé  a lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated   my sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love  wasn t enough that i liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right  nope  only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests   i was livid  i had been journaling  using positive self talk  etc but all i could think is  wow  people only care about me when i can offer them something    creative services  language skill  advice  emotional support child care   if there isn t a task or skill i can do people rarely give a fuck about me   i didn t want to share this  and told her i needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until i cried at a shrine  i told her why i was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because  we re on vacation   i turned on my data to call my mom  she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when i asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings   i literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for   seconds and be a broken hearted    something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple  but is trying her fucking best   i didn t need to spend more money on experiences  i didn t need to pretend i wasn t upset   i just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for    seconds and realize the only thing i want is a little goddamn empathy   my family rarely thanks me for things  they don t care unless i m in crisis or isolating  i ve learned to ask for what i need but it doesn t matter because unless i have extreme reactions they can t be bothered to hear me   i am happy for my sister  i truly am  but jfc i am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup   which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak    feelings don t go away because you re on vacation  therapy taught me to deal with my shit  but unless i act in bad old ways my family doesn t react   i am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi  i m part of this family too   tl dr depression reared it s head on exotic vacation  talking through issues got me yelled at     edit   whoa   thanks for the gold  didn t really expect this but if you re a depressed empathy like me i know it s hard and i know it s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions  well get through it ,1
ive showered every day for   days  i know that this is probably pathetic  but my depression got very bad and i didnt shower for months  now im back on track  going to try and keep going in every day now   sorry if i bothered you  ,1

ive contacted a psychiatrist its my last resort before i kill myself  i know no one cares  but i dont have anyone else to tell about this  ,1
if the moods of normal people fall between  happy  and  sad   the moods of depressed people fall between  distracted  and  miserable   some days im pretty okay  well  not really okay  its just that theres enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on netflix  video games  and other shit that doesnt do anything for me  it keeps my mind off of things  it keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself  its pretty much exactly like taking painkillers  you know youre not okay  and you know the pain will come back no matter what  but what matters is that in that moment youre managing to not feel anything  and that in itself is a massive fucking success  ,1
i am    m  seems to be most subscribers are young  just like the title says i am    m  i visit r depression every day and start by clicking new   while reading the posts i am always looking for those in my age bracket  which is few and far between  my depression has its roots in      but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in       when i first visited my therapist  about   weeks ago  i typed a one page summary of my life from      to current  it wasnt pretty  went from a financially secure  entrepreneur  business owner  great father  decent husband  community volunteer  coach  etc  to       lost house  broke  in debt  irs issues  depressed mother f er  the issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and not being proactive  before  i always took the initiative and created opportunity  slowly but surely i lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down   so  my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college  or a    year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression  i care about what they write because i have   children           and i hope they never experience what we are going through  but  i still read every new post  because i hope to find the answer to my condition   ok  time to go and look at the pile of important things to do  and decide if i am going to take the initiative or go into my typical depressive state  have a good day   ,1

february   nd      i almost killed myself this past saturday  i m not sure if i was fully committed but i was invested enough to write a note  tidy up my room  and pick out which pills i was going to use to do it  my last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones  i must ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself  my friend came  my roommate came  my mother came    i took   pills but what i didn t tell them that i kept slipping myself more  i knew i wouldn t die but i wanted to come close  i wanted to know if death was truly what i wanted and if i got it i suppose my choice would ve been made either way  my dad  whom i love dearly  flew in to be near me and i so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest  i don t think this will be the last time i do this  i just don t feel much except weariness anymore and i m tired  to anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance  thank you for being there for me    ,1

im    and stuck in years of misery  depression is my self identity now and i dont know how to change it  planet earth literally seems pointless and i dont know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives  ive had depression such a long time and i too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life  or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult    im    working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills   but it does enough for me to live on my own which im grateful for   that is a success i guess   but ill be honest as well   the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health obsessed and trendy people  being stuck at this job  its the best money i can find now  literally makes me want to kill myself when i leave a shift there   ive got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what  constructive discharge  means that is what seems to be happening at work   so anyway i recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing ive been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone   i cant drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like i can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit i need   i have to get completely whacked on medication  which can be fun if you like it   but i dont like it when it is involuntary  to try to do anything physical around the house  like i had to do this one thing or id get a fine  and even then it is just so painful and hard to move   it will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe i can heal faster  i dont know   it seems like doctors where i am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it   so now i cant get some pain meds when i legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing   i really dont see much point in my living at all when i am just going through the motions of life but im miserable   i can get by financially  so far  but i dont want to just get by while i feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself   i hate it and there is no point to living this way   and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now   i dont know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives   i guess they are happy enough with that   i am not ok with it at all   hurting my family is the only reason i am waiting or havent already gone through with it   we dont get along so great right now but i would still never want to hurt them in that way   i gotta add  just to be honest and inclusive  that i have anxiety as bad as i have depression   its almost agoraphobic   like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong   being stuck here i am not happy but i guess i am safe   i shouldnt have to live like this  no one should   thanks ,1
anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes  i m in my mid twenties and i feel all i do is sit around and mope  this is supposed to be the golden age of people s lives  i ve accepted that i am different than other people who know how to live fully  but what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be  it feels like i took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet  like i am responsible for my sadness and there s nothing i seem to be able to do about it  edit  didn t think this would get so much traction  been going through every response and at least i don t feel this away alone  thank you so much for sharing  and thanks for the advice too   ,1

do you ever wonder if you are really just selfish  lazy and manipulative person who convinced youself that youre depressed to feel better about it  i felt like this very often lately  its terrifies me  i keep telling myself that this is all just in my head  but is it true  or is it merely a comforting thoungt i am desperately clinging to    sorry for my terrible english   ,1
anyone else get depressed simply over the fact that their own life is so boring and repetitive  this happens to me everytime i read a really good book manga  watch a really good tv show anime movie  or listen to an amazing song track  i get so engrossed in it that once it ends  i remember my shitty boring life that isnt going anywhere  and i just begin to cry  simply because of how benign and mundane my life is  i just want to escape my life to go to that distant place that i read about  watch or listen to   i wish everything existed  ,1
i m having one of those days where i am feeling the worst of my depression every time i hope it passes  but the depression is always there  to some degree  ,1
i socially isolate myself and then wonder why people dont ask to hang out  it seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends  a big part of me doesnt blame them   they seem happy and for that i am glad  its not like they havent reached out before  they did  and i was guarded and made excuses not to hang out  nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed  it must be difficult   a few weeks ago  some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me  i accepted and was looking forward to it  but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts  i saw tonight through her instagram story  several of them ended up going out anyway as a group   it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason   im not sure who i am if im such a terrible friend   not sure how to make it better  ,1
i lost my personality  i ve just realized that i haven t been myself for awhile  i used to be really funny but i don t make jokes anymore  i m barely personable and i don t talk to people unless they speak to me first  i m such a fucking robot and i didn t even realize it  so that s fun    edit  thanks for giving this post a lot of attention  it s good to know i m not alone ,1
does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time  lately i ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that i m not really interested in doing anything  i don t want to be seen by people  so i dont leave my house  i spend a lot of time watching tv and if i m not doing that i m browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing  i feel like i m wasting my life but i don t know how to change  ,1
has anyone else seen a significant drop in their iq as a result of their mental illness  ever since ive had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away  i used to be sharp  in many ways i was above average even  nowadays  my grades are failing  i have a hard time keeping up with conversation  and new ideas are difficult  today  i tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me  like i just couldnt get the full idea  what has happened to me  is this common with the other people on this subreddit   ,1
depression feels more  real    optimism feels like a delusion throughout the day ill have moments  sometimes hours even  when things look up  ill plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals  get my life together  etc    but all the while it just feels sort of   fake  like im tricking myself  im always wondering  how long can i keep it up this time   when the time comes that i finally admit its all pointless  that my life will be terrible no matter what i try to do  it always feels more like accepting reality than depression    this is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect  none ever has  would just be a delusion  like cypher knowingly going back into the matrix to be able to eat  steak   it just seems like a dishonest existence   and then i tell myself id rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion    i dont really know why im writing this here  i guess im just sick of talking to myself  this somehow seems a little better  that might be another delusion     ,1

i feel too sensitive to exist being insecure sucks  not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself  i ve become fragile to everything around me  to the people around me  i can t take insults or arguing  i think everyone is mean or doesn t like me  it feels so silly  but i can t shake off the sadness  my first thought when things make me upset is i don t want to live  i don t like being this way anymore  i just want to be perfect or at least less insecure  i don t like sharing these feelings to people  but i want someone to understand  how do i stop being fragile  i feel like i m too broken to be around people and i m happier alone   edit  this post is open to anyone wanting to express their feelings  unite fellow fragile people     edit     thank you for all of the replies and helpful advice  i know i ll be coming back to re read many of these messages  y all are getting upvotes   i know i m in need of a therapist  still it was nice to write down these thoughts here  i posted this during a dark moment  woke up feeling better  i ll do my best to reply  stay safe  indoors  ,1
suicide isnt the answer  but people shouldnt call it the cowards way out i mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship  and people are going to call them cowardly  in my opinion  thats seriously low  they dont know what theyve been through  how are you going to call someone cowardly if you dont know their story  or have never felt the exact feelings they felt  everyone processes pain differently  even though it could be  no big deal  for you  it could be pain and anguish for someone else  there is no such thing as a coward  everyone is brave in one way or another   sorry for the vent rant but i seriously hate life    but im too stubborn to give up  and i dont want to be called a coward because of the few times ive thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful  i dont necessarily mean killing myself  but ive thought about giving up getting life together  getting in shape  because depression is so hard to break out of  but i will always keep trying  ,1
no one showed  i should have expected that  ive only ever had one friend in my life  ive tried to make more  but people hate me  ive gone to community events  parties  hobby shops   etc to meet people  people just dont seem to click with me  im seen as odd  annoying  weird to name a few things ive been called  the only person i can call a friend is my wife  and i still do not understand how that came along  she just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different   earlier this year  my wife discovered i have never had a birthday party  i never really had any friends to have a party  so i just never tried to have one  she said that was an injustice and i should have a party and invite friends from facebook   she decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago  we planned it out for a month  made all the decorations by hand  hand cooked all the snacks and food  even made our own party games to play  sent out invitations to people on my facebook  her friends  we even got rsvps back  it all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun  i was hopeful coming up on the day    then the day of the party happened  we rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited  the party start time came and    minutes later  no one was here  no big problem  everyone always comes to a party late    hours later  still no one came  i started to eat my snacks by myself    we got various excuses throughout the night   i got sick    stuff has come up    car isnt starting    no babysitters    my boss just called me in     my wife went to bed early  she was upset and mad  i told her its ok  i am strong outwardly for her  i dont want her to feel bad no one likes me  but i am being eaten up alive  i am now in my   s and i cant ever said ive had a true friend  other than my wife of course  im thankful she gave me a chance      i dont know what is wrong with me or why i seem to be broken  i never should have had this party because ever since then  i just cant get it out of my head  everyone time i would say outloud to my wife or family  they would tell me   dont say that  plenty of people are your friends  youre just being negative   now my wife truly sees what i mean    if i would have just told my wife no to the party  she wouldnt have been upset  and id still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless   edit  everyone  thank you for all of the birthday wishes  trying to get through replies and messages  didnt expect this many messages  thank you all again   edit    i see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife  i am very thankful for her  she is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and im the best that ever happened in hers  we have been through everything together even homelessness  that being said  i feel as if she isnt enough socially for me  we are   different people and even though we share a lot of interests  we do not share all of them  sometimes  it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too  example  she hates the show  its always sunny in philadelphia   she hates it to a point that if i watch it  it should be on my pc with headphones so she doesnt need to hear it  i do it because i can understand it frustrates her  but i love the jokes so much and i see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of iasip  but i have no one to share it with except the subreddit  ,1

i sold my guns  they originally belonged to my grandpa  im not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and i was a pretty good marksman  when he died  he left me two of his old rifles  theyve mostly sat locked in my closet ever since  worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them  partly out of sentimentality  but id come to realize that i also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons   my depression has been lifelong and ive had varying degrees of success fighting it  recently things have been okay but ive had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts  impulses to do things i dont even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and i would fixate on the details of the aftermath until i would bring myself either to tears or to panic    what if i just went up there and did it  would my wife be better off in the long run  would the friends i havent spoken to in years show up    this is shit i do not need running through my mind   two years ago i was feeling better  i was finally getting serious about art and photography again  i actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work  then the grey returned  and i started seeing less and less worth going out to see    then the darkness came back and i became convinced that those things i used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon   so  last week  i made a decision  packed up the guns  all the ammo i had left  and drove to the sporting goods store   i got       cash for the pair of guns  and on the way home i stopped by best buy and bought myself a fujifilm x t  for just around         later that evening  the intrusive thoughts returned as i tried to think about dinner      what if i just went up there and     then it cut off  the pressure was gone  went up there and what  grabbed the camera ive always wanted and started taking pictures   i did  i cursed the cold  bundled up  grabbed my new gear  and lost myself in the woods  taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though   ive been shooting the camera for the last week and i cant put it down  i feel something  im really fucking good at this and im motivated to do it  my worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself   its always going to be a struggle for me and i know that  but i feel free in a way that i never really expected           also posted in  r getting over it  if its not allowed to post in two subs  let me know and ill delete   ,1

i disappointed everyone that expected great things from me when i was attending high school  i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university  particularly mit  all my teachers were extremely proud of me  my parents were excited for my future in education  my peers thought highly of me  however  once the middle of my junior year came  i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression   i would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think  i eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on  nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing   at that moment  my life lost its meaning  near the end of my junior year into senior  i stopped taking care of myself  developed insomnia  due to my obligation to try and keep up with my ap classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering   and slept in all my classes    my teachers  parents  and peers as a result started looking down at me  wondering why i became such a  disappointment  according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload  this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing    i would resort to cutting myself  drinking  taking old prescription pills  and withhold from eating as a way to  punish  myself    to make this short  i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music  that is my dream  everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me  i wish it could go away    this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment  thank you if u actually do read this  ,1
i am no longer a   yo  unemployed  kissless virgin living with my parents  i am    now  how are all you other people doing today    edit  well  this got bigger than i expected  thank you for all the comments  and for the birthday wishes  ,1
i m literally having a breakdown every night i m literally bawling my eyes out every single day over how much i hate my life and becoming very suicidal  i cant do this anymore ,1
i procrastinate because im depressed  and im depressed because i procrastinate  ,1
anyone else find that  while youre super hard on yourself  youre almost too forgiving of others  in my hardest moments of depression  the thought monster convinces me that im worthless but that other people still have worth  i also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that theres really nothing we have any real control over  because of this  i can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable  but with myself  nothing is good enough  every decision i make seems to be not good enough  not worth enough to justify ongoing existence    are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth  ,1
casually suicidal  is anyone else  casually suicidal   like  you re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process  it s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them  ,1
does anybody sometimes hope they get sick  so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people  i just want disappear but i am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it  suiciding also affects all the people who know you  why did he do that  did i treat him wrong  my parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal    getting sick in a way that i couldnt be healed and die would be like an escape from this world   ,1
dae feel like youre turning dumber as depression gets worse  its almost like youre charlie from flowers for algernon   ,1
does anyone else live in their own head  i might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out    most of the time i start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends  as if  and an interesting life  like in a cartoon adventure or something  sometimes i even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that couldve happened    its starting to become more and more frequent and im finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head  then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when i realize my crazy fantasies will never happen    its just so much better in my mind  anyone else  ,1
why cant people understand im not just being lazy  i just feel unable to move no im not staying in bed until  pm because i think its cool  funny or that im lazy  its because i cant bring myself to get up  im not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice  this isnt how i want things to be   ,1
today i witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date  tldr  a tv repair guy kinda literally woke me up after   years   the tv in my house is really old and constantly needs repair  recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days i finally called the technician  he told me that the like last time  this time too the circuit board was out  he changed it and gave me the bill  i was like the circuit board had a   year warranty and it had only been      months  he looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last times receipt  it way dated may         at that time it struck me  i had no clue of the past   years of my life  i was on the bed surviving and still doing the same  i just cant stop crying since he left  the worst part is these   years were just the peak years  i have been depressed since the past    years and i cant stop thinking how much have i lost in life   ,1
anyone else feel like they go through each day just waiting to go to bed  im not sure if that makes sense  but i feel like i wake up each day just to wait to go to sleep at night   im almost    and i just quit my job that i was overqualified for a couple of months ago because my psychiatrist and i came to the conclusion that the nature of the job was not good for my ptsd or ocd   now i wake up everyday at around  pm because i cant sleep at night until around  am no matter how much or what medications i can take   i also feel tremendously guilty when i get down because i remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison   i also feel like outside of my parents i have none to talk to  not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff   i have friends but they never seem to want to do anything   nothing is interesting to me either  so i am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games  books  tv  and laptop at my disposal   i just want something to live for  and for life not to be so lonely anymore   ,1
ive thought about killing myself for so long ive forgotten thats supposed to be a red flag  im too chickenshit to do it though  im too afraid of whatever potential afterlife awaits me  and i feel too guilty about how it would affect some of my family    i dunno   the idea of suicide used to scare the shit out of me  but its become such a mundane  frequent thing that ive become numb and desensitized to it  i feel like its no longer a threat since i would have done it by now if id really do it  ,1
depression is physically painful it literally hurts to live ,1
you can never have an honest conversation about suicide when i was     someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note  i had planned on killing myself at the end of that week  the following events were an absolute  shit storm    my at the time girlfriend was devastated  my father was a wreck  my mother acted cold to me  and the whole school found out that their thoughts on  that crazy asshole  may have been justified    it s been almost   years since then and i ve seen therapists twice since  the part i hate the most about therapists is how you can t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die  when they ask  do you have thoughts of suicide   or  have you made plans of suicide   i know i have to answer  no  because if i m honest and say  yes  this is my plan  then i m going to get thrown back into the psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my  safety   if i can t be      honest with the person that s supposed to help me  then how am i supposed to get any help    when i realized this i stopped seeing a therapist  even after she promised me to keep coming in    at this point i feel like i have to fight this alone   ,1
as of today  im no longer a depressed teenager     now im just a depressed guy in his twenties   this sucks  ,1
this is how i tried to explain to my  gamer  friend how depression feels like  when one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels  i was at a loss for words at first  but then i remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this  thought id share it  maybe people can relate to it   edit  thank you all so much  it means a lot to me that it means a lot to you    okay  imagine youre playing an rpg and youve been going through the most hellish dungeon ever  youve been unprepared  underleveled and barely survived  then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever  its called the cape of depression  its completely op  putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you  sure  there are some negative stats on it too  but those seem managable  you put it on   and its as awesome as you thought it would be  nothing can harm you  it doesnt deflect or defend you against attacks  they simply pass through you  nothing can touch you anymore  swords  arrows  fireballs  doesnt matter  its all the same to you  because you simply dont feel it anymore  for some time you feel like a god  you glide through the masses and its exhilerating  nobody can touch you  youre completely free   but the cape has disadvantages  it doesnt just let attacks pass through you  but also any blessings  healing spells and potions  sure  its a bit inconvenient at first  but youll manage  after all nobody can hurt you anymore  so you dont need these kind of things anymore  actually you dont even miss them anymore  since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore  so why bother    so you continue with your quest  wrapped in the cape  but somehow it doesnt feel the same anymore  nobody can hurt you anymore  so you walk right through your enemies  not bothering to fight  nobody can heal or comfort you anymore  so you walk right through your allies too  not bothering to talk  its just you and the cape    its starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape  but as you try to take it off  you look down at yourself and realize that youre still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape  they never healed  but you never got any more either  then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape  its easy to remember too  after all you have those injuries to prove your point  you need the cape  so you decide to leave it on   at some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore  nothing can affect you  neither good or bad  so why bother  youre truly like a god now  but not in the grand  majestic kind of way  you are simply not in touch   both literally and metaphorically   with the normal people around you anymore  maybe youre mildly confused and irritated by them  why do they act like they do  whats the point   you dont want to feel left out  like a freak  so you pretend to still be in touch with them  the cape helps you  it grants you a     to acting and deceiving when talking about yourself  and you need that buff  because if someone would come to close to you  touch you  they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very  very wrong  you dont want that  so you stay away from others  which in turn makes you even more distant   by the time youve realized that the cape was cursed  its already too late  it has become a part of you  its wrapped around you  around your true self  you are still somewhere inside  but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling  no matter if good or bad out  youve worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels    to feel   when you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you  they only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain  they cast their healing spells on you  but they pass right through you  however all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal  so they get frustrated and give up  its just you and the cape    edit    oh  and i while this was not in my original explanation  i feel that this should definately be in       though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil  suddenly you can feel again  but the cape allows you only one single feeling  anger  youre angry at the cape for having so much power over you  youre angry at yourself for letting it happen and youre angry at your enemies and allies alike  you start to remember every single time insult and injury  from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you  you remember every single time your tank failed to protect you  every single healing spell cast just a second too late  suddenly youre the fickle god again  looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face  for a moment youre glad  you feel  and then the next day its over  the cape has worked its curse again  only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies  but fear not  the cape is still there  wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing   ,1
i can t stand it anymore  i m committing suicide  this is my story  being good and positive won t help u stop suffering  why does this happen to me   honest to god i hate my life so much  i m a    year boy i try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn t works  so much has happen to me in the last year  my parents and sister passed away in an accident last year  i don t if i should feel bad since they ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life  i never though much of it  but once my uncle raped me at    and told me to shut up or he ll kill me  when i came of age i found out the truth  i revealed it to  my parents  who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill  just because they wanted to save face  but what has happened happened   i escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up same night they tried to get me arrested   i escaped and entered foster care when i was        i m in my last year in high school  i have my gcse and i can t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel  i travel for   hours mostly walking  it s     miles  however i take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour    hours there and back  so that meant i had   hours to sleep or study so i barely get any chance to revise  especially since i know i m smart  i got straight  s  a  in my mocks before this unfolded   so it s so frustrating since i didn t do too well in my last mock  due to my parents death a few days before my  nd mocks started  now i m struggling to stay in my high sets  then there s my social life  as i said it s hard to do anything since i live far my original town  around an hour away   side track  i used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of me  motivated me to lose weight  age      kg  to age      kg  which i was proud off  but that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster  i gained weight and now i m age       months away from        kg   and one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could ve taken my  she had a high paying job  but she didn t want to take care of  kid    she s married and has a child   she was also a social worker  however i forgot to mention  it was this women  this women who i confided in  someone i though was my hope  she was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when i turn     she betrayed me and made it seems as though i fabricated this lie so i could move out  she promised me to wait till i turned    so i had a choice in my life  but nope she couldn t wait  first of all  i wasn t the only one raped    other kids were also raped by him  they both told my aunty  but to save face  they threatened the other two  because they re still     they re more likely to listen  i didn t  therefore the reason i was tortured  i hate her with all my life  my only hope turned into my biggest disappointment   police gave up due to the lack of testimony  whole family conspired against me  in addition to my social life  as i mention i was bullied my whole childhood  i was a fat kid who didn t know how to socialise  becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me  mentally or physically  and because i wasn t  popular    my  best friend  pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn t school  i was still naive then  he betrayed me twice in high school  i ended our friendship   years ago after the  nd time i trusted him and he betrayed me  a few weeks after that i met a new person who was a really good friend  that was when his cousin wasn t around  his cousin lied framed me racist comment weird even though we re the same race  but still i didn t even say it  i proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all i did was say the same thing back  and what my friend did was support him  that infuriated me since i knew he was supporting him and sat next thing what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone  i didn t end my friendship with this person  but i did drift off from him  i then met a person who was a genuine nice person  we had a good couple of months  but his parents were strict so we couldn t hang out much and we ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone i would trust  i also met another genuine person  he was a new kid  and he is now my best friend  i think  it was weird because i never expected it to happen since he was popular i was just well a student   even we re close and talk quiet a bit  but i always feel uncomfortable with him  he never answers me with full sentences  doesn t talk to me when we re with out group of friends  but i do know he cares for me as a friend  but a lot of the time i think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other  is that he never would ve bothered speaking to me  in fact he s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends  the thing our group of friends aren t like friend but just nice people in my perspective its like we re friends only when the other person is here  if u get what i mean   it honestly is so fucked up me  i only have  what like a month to my gcse and all i  am is depressed  down  i have never once been happy this year  actually that was a life  the only thing that makes me happy is anime  i ve developed an anime addiction ever since age    this was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so i went upstairs to watch movies until i stumbled onto anime  the only good thing i can think of is that in   mo the i turn    which means i ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers  i ll be in a new town  in a new school  i ll be in college  and i ll be able to start a fresh start  but still looking how my life is  it feels like i m meant to have a hard life  it doesn t help that i m an atheist because that means i m not able to rely on someone with      belief  i ve never had a true true friend  my education is pretty much ruin  i m literally on my own  my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can t find any more placements   it s so fucking frustrating  honestly is it just that some people have a hard life  i ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that i ve dozed of many time on the bus i just can t care anymore  all i want now is to become rich and take over the world  without any selfish desires  i just want to truly make this world better  because it doesn t look like anyone is gonna help me  i ve tried  got hurt   many times and all for what     edit  half a year later into now january      in my first year of college   my life has gone worse  i m not in the mood to explain it  somehow  somehow it s gone worse  ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder  and no one understands me  they have bad view of me  and when i try to explain  they place their authority over me and won t let me talk  especially when i have facts  my social life hasn t changed  my genuine friend with strict parents  guess what happened  you would have never would ve guessed he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person  i ve gained weight  i m back to my weight before my weight loss  i m now again   kg  i didn t get into the course i wanted in college becuz i was a grade behind  the works easy  but i can t seems to concentrate  i zone out when the teacher scolds  even though i really do want to listen  i do want to try  i ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday i ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it s effect  even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide  i m lost  i m hopeless  i ve got no one for me  i m no one number one  i m alone  i got literally nothing  to lose  and no one benefits from me being alive  it i ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world  i have bad luck  there s no desputing that  it is what it is  i m committing the act on my birthday which is in june   to a certain extent  this is kinda funny  who would ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area  who would ve though  not trying to sound pessimistic but i was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone i meet would suffer like this  the good guy gets nothing  wow even i cringed when i said that  whatever happens in june happens  if i do commit  i d at least want someone to know my story  and if they meet someone like me  please i beg with all my life  help him  the one thing i wish i had  was someone who understood  someone who didn t listen because they had but they wanted to  someone who wouldn t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help   someone who would ve been my hero  thank you for reading  this is ku kw before i changed my name and after initials                sorry i should ve mentioned it  i m in my second half on year     college   i failed my gcse  i didn t get enough sleep  i ran away during one exam and all the others i couldn t concentrate  i kept zoning out  i didn t get into my a level classes  i haven t made any new friends  my anxiety hasn t lessened in fact my social life has gone far worse im finding it hard to keep up with all things pain i feel mentally  ,1
i hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention  of course they want attention  they need help  how else are you supposed to get help if no one knows  ,1
has your memory gotten worse with your depression  my memory is absolutely terrible now  to the point where i second guess myself about whether something really happened or not  i can still remember information as well as i normally did  but for the life of me i cannot clearly recall highly emotional interactions  normally negative   i can replay the situation once in the direct aftermath  but then i ll keep questioning whether or not i imagined certain things  the only thing i can confidently say i remember is on a scale of      how shitty i felt during said situation  little details slip away and i don t trust my recollection of what actually happened  i always end up asking someone who was there if my recollection of the situation is correct and it almost always is  but i keep doubting my memory  ,1
i wish i could just press a button and never have existed  everyone would forget me  and id just be gone  i fantasize about this every day  but its impossible  i want this more than anything else  ,1
i spoke to my ups guy  when i go to sign for packages i make a joke everyone he comes about my handwriting  i say   please dont judge my writing     and he usually says   its alright    until the other day he went on to say    you love to sign huh    and he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesnt mind my terrible scribble  he even smiled and told me to have a good day  this little interaction made my day  as soon as i closed the door i told myself i did good  i held a conversation  its the little things guys  stop beating yourself up and focus on the things youve done successfully  have a great day night  ,1
every time im faced with some kind of challenge my first thought is  i should just kill myself so i dont have to do this   its pathentic   ,1
i talked to a girl on campus today and asked if she wanted to hang out she had a boyfriend so she had to decline but thats alright  at least she was upfront about it  just wanted to share this small victory i had today  ,1
what do people do to pass the time  my attention span is close to zero  everything is horribly uninteresting  when im not feeling suicidal  i feel bored  life is just an endless cycle of boredom for me  i wake up and instantly feel bored and depressed  i go through every day doing absolutely nothing  sometimes i try to do something i used to enjoy like drawing or playing the guitar  but it changes nothing  its incredibly boring and i stop after    minutes max because its not worth it  not even video games hold my attention anymore  all i do is eat  listen to music and watch youtube until i can sleep again    im thinking of trying drugs but i dont know where to get any since im underage  which is probably a good thing  i dont know what to do with myself anymore  im considering ending it at this point  ,1
does anyone else want to die without committing suicide  for quite a while now ive been pretty bummed out  and whenever i am just crossing the road or on the top of a building i just envy that somehow my death could be accidental  or just wish that someone would kill me for no reason  i wouldnt say that im suicidal but i just dont want to be here anymore and it would be easier on my family if they thought it was an accident  does anyone else feel this way  ,1
i hate these mood drops i was fine a minute ago then now i feel like i just fell from the    th floor then landed face first on the concrete ,1
so i have this virus  depression exe  on my computer    about a year ago i realized my computer was running slower than usual of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual  once i realized  i opened the process tab and find this program  depression exe  running  hogging a lot of my cpu  im fairly sure its a virus  but the weirdest thing is that i haven t been downloading anything that would contain a virus  and as far as i can tell it doesnt even have a function  its only purpose is to hog cpu and make it more difficult to perform basic functions   so anyway i try closing it  but nothing happens  i try again until windows gives me the typical  depression exe is not responding   obviously i click  close now  and wait a bit  but still nothing happens  i keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program  psa this is an awful idea  trying to do too much will only overload your computer  but my desktop only freezes  oh well i say  i ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow i ll have more success in getting rid of the virus   the next week or so i keep mashing buttons and hitting  end now   but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day  meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my cpu  programs run slower  and i experience more stutters and lags in processing  eventually i gave up trying to end depression exe by conventional means  and sought antivirus software   the software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change  and unfortunately did no good  sure  it was able to detect the virus  it turns out that it s not so uncommon   but was useless in actually removing it  i had the same experiences with other antivirus software  not powerful enough  didn t detect the problem  misidentified the virus  the list goes on  i still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case  but most of the time it just uses up even  more  cpu   some other users try to help  but it s obvious they never had this malware   have you tried turning it on and off again    sometimes when my computer is overloaded  i just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit   or  it ll run quickly again  you ll see   they don t understand just how terrible depression exe is   it s difficult because i rely on this computer for school  work  you name it  when i first had the virus it wasn t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities  but since the virus has grown  it s become  much  more difficult  some days the computer won t even boot up  i miss assignments and fall behind  all because of this awful virus  i see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what i did to get this virus  and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model    some days  i just want to scrap my computer  even though i can t afford a new one   edit  thanks so much for the positive response guys  ive enjoyed reading all your responses  and hope you get a hug for every bad day youve had    ,1
some people think depression anxiety is just a way to get attention  but attention is the last thing i want  just leave me alone and let me die   ,1
every time i try to speak about my depression  it sounds like a cliche  so i keep it to myself  i have tried to write something in this group so many times but i always delete it  ive typed this exact sentence at least   times in the past  but havent hit send   so fuck it    im depressed  im dealing with it in my own way   i listen to music a lot  it takes me somewhere  i just wish some songs were longer   i take codeine to numb myself quite often  i get a prescription every now and then  as i have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time  haha  lifes a cunt    i cant cry  i need to  i feel it nearly everyday  being right on the brink of tears  but theres nothing there    i dont know how its possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel everything  every fucking thing  i cant breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes  so many thoughts running through my head at once  every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things  all at once  and yet if you were to look at me  you would see the most blank  dull empty stare  im nothing  and yet my mind tries to be everything haha  such a broken piece of shit    i think about hurting myself and dying a lot  it used to scare me  i remember the first time i genuinely thought about killing myself  it scared me  and it kinda felt good that thats how i reacted  but that was ages ago  its so common now  its just part of what it is to be me    insignificant         hey  thank you everyone for the response      when i typed this out  i didnt expect it to get noticed and i almost didnt send it again haha  i just thought fuck it what have i got to lose  but im glad i did  i cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me  people who have commented or messaged me personally and said that i hit a personal note to them  it means a lot to me  im sorry if i dont get around to replying to everyone  you know how it is  but believe me that i appreciate this more than you know   in the future i will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send  much love  ,1
i feel like im right back where i was at the end of       and i fucking hate it  no love  no happiness  and nothing but the clothes on my back  quarantine has been draining me and taking away literally everything that i had left that made me happy  now  i can barely pull myself out of bed  id rather lay there and let the days fly by until something else happens  preferably death   nothing is working for me  and i feel like i truly have nothing right now  quarantine took my job away and left me unemployed  unemployment insurance hasnt been coming in even after claiming it every week  so i have no money  i still have yet to receive any kind of stimulus check  my fitness has gone right back downhill  and i cant even get myself to do any basic exercise  the person i gave my heart to is still out there  doing   whatever she is doing in colorado  all of my plans for this year have been steadily getting cancelled  i still live in a shithole area of the world  and have thought every single day about where id like to move to in order to escape this hell  and today i ran into the girl i saw months ago  and hoped to see again   and i couldnt even get myself to say hello   this isnt the end of the world   but it feels so much like it  and i find myself wanting it to be the end  i didnt want much out of life  and i didnt get it    ,1
anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden  this is definitely because of my anxiety  and i know that i really am not a burden to these people   but does anyone feel the same  ,1

do you ever just look at people and think   wow  im a giant loser  i just need to know im not alone  im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than i have because i wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone  i mean right now while i cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because i cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals i cant focus for more than half an hour before i take a fifteen minute break  tldr  dae feel like a loser and hate life ,1
what depression isnt  depression isnt an emotion  depression has no cause  too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety  i came out to my boss over my depression a while ago  and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people i know  he wont mention it  he sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing   depression  when it is present  is more like the force of gravity  it is there  pulling down on you under all circumstances  though im depressed i am often very happy  but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all  waiting   a creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life  a storm of screaming and hatred in dreams  a dull apathy in waking  a sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope    depression isnt an emotion  depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life  ,1

has anyone ever had a period of being okay  only to crash back down into the blackness without any discernable reason why  i struggled for a fair while  probably years  the last two months or so i ve felt great  however since yesterday i ve just seemingly hit rock bottom again  can t see any positivity in anything  can t motivate myself to do basic things  i m trying to tell myself it s just a passing blip  however i m low key worried i m going back to the bad place  anyone have similar situations experiences   edit  i wrote this and fell asleep shortly afterwards  i m blown away by the responses  i m going to read through every comment and try and reply throughout my day at work  ,1
i feel like im drifting through life  seeing how far i get before i kill myself   ,1
does the idea of living the rest of your life just sound exhausting like the past    years have felt so awful even tho i have lived a pretty decent life  i feel like there is no escape  ,1
anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts  even though i know im glossing over the bad memories    at least there were good ones as well ,1
my girlfriend died and i dont know how to go on    she had cancer and was      weve been together for   years and were going to marry in a couple of years   we had lived for   years by now and everything was going perfectly   maybe too much   we were faithful  devoted to each other  she was my oxygen  i was hers  she was my first and truly love  ive never been with any other girl but her    i feel kinda depressed and alone   we had no many friends  so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives   ill leave for our house next week  since ive been with my family so far   im joining my old job again  but this time  no one will wait for me at home  my salary will be just for me  and all that mattered now it doesnt    ive got no reasons to keep on living  somebody tells me i should be glad to still be in this life  but as i see it  its a curse  a damnation  she doesnt suffer anymore  as i am every second of my life now    just wanted to open up to you    ,1
does anyone make drafts and ends up not posting  i have a ridiculous amount of drafts here talking about how i feel  i don t know why  maybe i just want the support of others who possibly feel the same or i m embarrassed  i feel like i can t go to my friends or family to talk about it  my family would immediately send me to a psych ward  i tried to od a few years back and was locked up   my friends would call me dramatic    so  i guess this is my stepping stone to post here   edit  wow it s kind of relieving to see that everyone feels the same  but hey  let s support each other  ,1
depression  the disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends  and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you  thanks  depression  i  knew  isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful  and yet i did it anyway because i felt i didnt have a choice  now that i put myself in this position  even my small group of friends that  understand what im dealing with  or know whats going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely  and i know its really not their fault  but it still hurts when i see the pictures or hear about it in passing  i know i cant expect people to still invite me to things when i always decline  especially now when the days that i feel up to being around other people are few and far between  the  anti social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of   ,1
imagine how amazing it would be if i just went to sleep and didn t wake up ever again  that s it  that s all everyone  ,1
it sucks when you re no one s first choice there is always someone that has a better connection  or is the better friend  or the better go to person  a person that makes them laugh more than you do or someone who they would have more fun going out with instead of you     it sucks to know you re aren t the first person to pop into any one s mind for anything      ,1

anyone else here have no real hobbies goals interests and justs waste time on reddit youtube etc    ,1
i don t know if i m still depressed  i don t feel numb or sad  but i feel unmotivated  unfulfilled  blank and flat  i don t want to end it all  but i don t care if i live or die  i can almost feel pain and numbness creeping into me sometimes  but it just goes away as soon as it came   i honestly don t even know what i want anymore  ,1
yesterday i finally went to the doctors to speak about my mental health     he has diagnosed me with depression and given me anti depressants  also recommended seeing a counselor  furthermore  i went back to play hockey last night for the first time in   years  after a year of feeling awful  i am ready to turn it around   edit  thanks very much to everybody who commented such thoughtful  positive and kind comments  also thanks for the advice throughout too  the response made me feel so happy and like id really taken a big step  also thank you to the very kind person who gave me a silver    ,1
am i becoming less intelligent  does anyone else here find that long periods of isolation and depression makes their brains feel slower  like holding an conversation requires more effort and problem solving is a lot more difficult  even trying to formulate basic thoughts into text requires some hard thinking  i feel so foggy  detached and slow     ,1

you dont get it  it gets better   stop thinking about it   get over it   etc   stop  saying  that    i hate it as much as you do  i just want to be free from my mind  i am my worst enemy  i hate myself  i hate myself so fucking bad  you have no idea  and i hate my situation  i hate my life and i am trying to control my emotions    its   not   easy    did you ever get in your car and thought  huh  maybe this time i will die  and feel almost disappointed you havent finished in a car crash    have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like  damn  it was close   started to cut vegetables  and thought about hurting yourself    hang yourself  fall off a bridge    there are honestly thousands of ways i could have ended my life  for many horrible reasons  my own demons eating me  my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth   i feel like shit and like i dont deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better  i am lost  i am alone  i feel horribly    horribly numb     i just want to die      ,1
i feel like im feeling less and less excited about stuff  especially stuff that involves socializing or dealing with people ,1
does anyone else feel that people only  tolerate  you  i hate thinking this way  i have a few friends  but i ve never felt i was truly  in  the group   we  hang out  together  but most of the conversations would be other people talking  sometimes i wonder if they only take advantage of me because i would try my hardest not to lose them so i won t be alone    do they really enjoy being around me  do they like me  i wonder   if i should find new people  but i don t want to be alone   edit  waved hi to a friend  she completely ignored me     ,1
i dont want to die  i want to stop feeling like death is the only solution  no matter what it comes back  sometimes just by dropping a pencil  ,1
does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years  i feel like after years of being depressed ive become worse at everything i try to do  i used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me  when im studying il forget everything and even when im focused on reading i almost feel like im just staring at a blank page    no matter what i do i cant seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more i feel like im getting dumber slower and less interesting  ,1
i feel like i m not as important in other people s lives as they are in mine i have very few friends  and even then i m not really close to them  it s very hard for me to make friends  and even harder to open up to them  i know they have plenty of other friends they re much closer to and it wouldn t really make much of a difference if i disappeared  meanwhile  if they disappeared from my life  i would pretty much have no one  i just wish i really mattered to someone  ,1
why do i feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me  no matter how good a conversation goes  i always end up so depressed and crying because i feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me  especially if i did something  embarrassing      any advice  ,1
hospital bills after suicide attempt i attempted suicide about three years ago  and im still struggling to pay the hospital bills  yesterday  i received a bill for a charge i didnt even know about   it just doesnt make any sense  i wanted to be dead  but they forced me to stay alive  and now i have to pay them for it  plus i have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again  i feel like im literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills    why couldnt they let me just die  ,1

this is horrible  but    does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital  being bedridden for a while  i picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits    i picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that i have   i picture myself finally being able to do what i want  to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities   i picture my ex visiting me  and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is   ,1
unemployed therapist i m a therapist  but recently lost my job to my depression  it was a personal choice  but i felt that everyone i worked with wanted me to leave  i have severe issues with self doubt  i feel like a fraud  like my msed is not legit  i didn t deserve to graduate magna cum laude   my family is financially supportive when i need them but not much else  my mom just tells me to take my meds  i do   or she offers me her meds  i told my sister earlier this year that i was feeling suicidal and she basically said   between you and my cheating husband i m going to go insane    my own husband is patient but not very supportive  i ve been on the couch since monday and he has been operating as normal  working  going into the office  never stopping to ask how i am  i know he wants me to return to  normal   i worry he ll give up on me   i interviewed for another job last week and this week  it was an adoption counselor position  something i ve always dreamt of  i did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup  i didn t get the job    while still working  i found a therapist  in hopes of getting the support i needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself  i made the mistake of telling her that i smoke weed sometimes  she then began questioning my work and my physical health  she also felt my main goal should be to get off meds     mg prozac   as i was somehow  putting my health at risk   needless to say  i plummeting deeper into depression   i spoke to my pcp and he prescribed me an antipsychotic  after two days  i was so sick i had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again  when i asked to try something different  he told me  pills aren t going to make you happy    i guess i feel hopeless and alone  i have two little boys who are   and    my oldest son has severe special needs  i am able to take care of them  but i cannot get off the couch to do anything else  my body hurts  i can t eat anything  my husband and kids went to breakfast and i stayed home to watch tv in my pajamas   i feel a bit like i m already dead  and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me  ,1

attempted suicide last night  now im being guarded      by police officers  so last night i got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way  i took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka  i would have chosen something more effective if i had thought about it more and im so mad at myself right now  i had the chance to die and i ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me  i refused to go with them so then i got fucking detained and handcuffs  cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals   currently being guarded around the clock by police officers  luckily theyve all been really nice but this fucking sucks  i wish id been less stupid and less of a pussy  pills are not worth it man  probably fucked my liver up for life    oh and only one person has visited me  a friend  none of my family have so much as messaged me to see if im okay  im also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much  how fucking dare they  im going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings  i fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world   sorry for the rant  maybe someone here can relate    update  im so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been  i knew this community was amazing already but ive never made an actual post before  im using a alt account so when i shitpost people cant see all my private life to this extent   you are all awesome humans and i wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness   so update on me if anyone is reading  i was moved to a secure unit   hours away from my home city to be assessed  theyve deemed me fit to leave  nhs is very underfunded  i repeatedly told them im probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me  but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet  i needed a safe space  i met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a b b for the night in the lovely city of salisbury   for americans not brits this is near to stonehenge  he was beyond amazing  its not usual for people to get a b b but i was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all  he even drove me here  gave me a massive hug and told me i was lovely  dont think ill ever forget his kindness    im doing okay  of course i still have near constant suicidal thoughts but ive resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days     thank you all for your comments and love     lots of love   jasmine  ,1
anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems  like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies  actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to  actually have something worth living for  if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head  at the same time i would be happy just having one good friend  living a mediocre life  aint nothing wrong with that its just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head  when i point this out im sure a lot of you guys gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction  its so goddamn hard  unless im speaking to my family a nice psychologist  i seriously cant keep the act together  i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do  and feel  not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether its just in your head or whatever its very real for us  i think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources  i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state  that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free  yay free shit      edit  its always nice to know you are not alone  so for that i am grateful  but the fact that a lot of people feels similar the same as me makes me really sad  its a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there  i really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park  and all of us will achieve that which we want     ,1

depression is addicting why does it always feel easier to live in this discomfort than being happy  i get better and always feel myself coming back to this state   it s like my mind is tricking me into thinking being depressed is easier  any time something remotely bad happens i think  well i can always kill myself if it gets worse   life is overwhelming me  i need help  ,1

do you ever cope by imagining a person world that makes you feel safe  i think we might become stronger if we can imagine things are perfect when reality is falling apart  it doesnt always work but you can always try ,1
regular check in  and some info about high risk posts  welcome to the  ir regular check in post   a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing  if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about  these shouldnt be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the  role model  rule  but are welcome here   or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post  this is a place you can share   we try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddits wide open anonymity friendly platform  the community rules can be found in the sidebar  if you arent sure about a rule  please ask us  if you have concerns or questions about the community policies  this is a good place to raise those as well          this time i want to share some points about helping ops who may be at risk for suicide       although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at  r suicidewatch  we dont feel that  any  kind of  you should post there  not here  message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress   however  the information in  the sw sidebar   r suicidewatch about sidebar  may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide   we link the two most important posts for helpers  the talking tips and risk assessment guide  from the sidebar here  but theres a lot more there       almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they dont know that hotlines exist   just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated   also  if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case  dont just assume a persons in the us  imagine the how it would feel for a us redditor to be told  just call          thatll work everywhere  meaning everywhere in the european union  theres a global directory in the  r suicidewatch sidebar  which is also linked here  and thats the best link to offer someone whose location you dont know       remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs   the situations where breaching someones confidentiality is the best option are the outliers  like when someone is strangled by a safety harness  plus  we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone  which has to go through reddits admins and their legal team  and subjecting them to a traumatic  invasive  involuntary intervention  which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future       if you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason  including high risk of harm  please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking  report    the linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddits dna  so clicking  report  on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter  which we have no control over       keep in mind that the most reliable way to de escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood   a strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide  thats one of the many reasons why  this little empathy video  https   www youtube com watch v  evwgu   jw  is always linked from our sidebar   ,1
i m only    but i can t shake this feeling that my life is over  i feel like i wasted my youth  i get so nostalgic for high school and being that young again even though it was one of the roughest periods of my life  i just have this existential dread hanging over me  like what s left after this  i wasted what s supposed to be some of the best years of your life and now i m old and my future will be working     and paying bills while living paycheck to paycheck trying to survive  i don t know how anyone is truly happy in life   edit  thank you guys so much for all the responses  i ve read each one and they seriously made my day so much better  i m going to visit my college s counseling service and attempt to make sense of my brain  ,1
depression is the worst pain ive ever felt  it feels like falling down a dark bottomless pit  wondering if your fall will ever end  and as you look back to where you fell from  the only way out  you  see it receding further and further into the distance  the light becoming dimmer and smaller while the hole in which you are falling becomes deeper  darker  and tighter  the light above you eventually disappears and leaves you in complete darkness  you can only look down  towards the end  hoping it will come soon  ,1
today i realized im a panda  proof     the majority of food i eat daily is greens  mostly just spinach and kale     i have low no sex drive  due to antidepressants     i sit lay around most of the day    people care more about me staying alive than i do    i honestly dont know if this funny  sad  or somewhere in between   ,1
i fucking miss being able to enjoy things now its just feelings of emptiness and hopelessness  ,1
can you be suicidal but be scared to die  i think about dying a lot  i think about the affect it would have and what would happen to the very few people who care about me  sometimes i wish everything would stop and i could just be gone   but i m terrified of death  i think it s my anxiety taking over   i feel like i can t even be suicidal correctly  which i guess isn t a bad thing but it makes everything worse in my fucked up head making me feel like more of a failure  ,1
i feel like im becoming dumber everyday  i literally cannot focus on anything  i cant pay attention in class  i cant study  i cant read a book  i cant even pay attention to video games  i cant watch a    min youtube video  im constantly zoning out  im just mindlessly going through life without really enjoying anything   edit   thanks for all your replies  i didnt know so many of you were feeling the same way as me  glad to know im not alone  gives me a bit of hope  ,1
i hope this puts a smile on your face  reddit   ,1

my mother died unexpectedly about   hours ago  the pain is paralyzing  i was at my friends bday party at a bar when my father called me and told me that my mother laid to down to take a nap but never woke up  he was in bad shape when i got there so i decided to spend the night  i m laying here hoping it s just a nightmare but it s really happening  she was my best friend and i don t know how i m going to go on   ,1
anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances  a lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons  i really dont have any  im pretty happy with my life set up  of course there are some things id change but on the whole its good    i just have this endogenous  chemical depression thats as bad as being in physical pain  ive been on so many meds in the past and they dont seem to work for me anymore  i run distance every single day and eat well   not asking for advice as such  just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper   ,1
sometimes i fantasize about someone catching me crying and asking if im ok     edit  so  i wasnt expecting this to blow up like this  thanks everyone for the positivity        i am very good at hiding my depression  my husband knows about it but never asks me if im ok  even though hes very supportive and doesnt hold it against me when he comes home and due to not feeling like existing i didnt do the dishes for example    i know i dont make anything easy by not letting it show  and always wearing a social mask  smile   but it would be good to open my heart to someone  that really wants to hear me    ,1
it s  am i have not slept and i am spiraling edit   obligatory  wow this blew up  i found this subreddit in early hours of the morning  very anxious and upset about life in general  i don t even know if i m using it right haha  but i wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a  damn me too  because it really helps knowing i m not alone in my feelings  i am currently seeing a therapist  he is great i ve been going to him for a while  but unfortunately it s a little hard for me to see him because he s at my university s counseling center and he s pretty much always booked  i so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave  it s definitely something i m going to look into  and it wasn t anything i was aware of until now  so thank you for mentioning it  someone suggested i wasn t going to class just because  i feel like for clarification s sake i should mention the reason i haven t been is because i got very sick  i know these absences are excused  and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult  i live about    minutes away from campus  so it s not like i can just run out of my dorm into my class haha     i don t know really know where else to go or how to format this so i guess i ll just bullet point why my life is extra shitty right now     college is kicking my ass right now  i haven t been to class in like   weeks    what s the point in going anymore i am so far behind by now and    i don t even want to be in college right now and it s taken me a year and a half to really realize i only went because i felt pressured to by peers and family  i want to drop out so badly  because i know i m just not in the headspace to do it right now  but my family expects a lot out of me because i was  smart  in high school and i don t want them all to hate me and also i will lose a pretty big scholarship if i quit going and shakdnhdiebd  not to mention no one else my age is having any problems with this  just me which makes me feel   x worse about the whole thing  like i have friends taking    hours this semester and i m so behind and i m only doing    haha what a loser amrite     i found out last week that i m losing my job  i work retail and yeah i could find another job easy  but i was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store i work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan  not to mention it s almost holiday season  i don t want to be the newbie at a new job when it s already gonna be hectic and i love the place i work at right now and i m just sad in general it s gonna be gone    i started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes i feel fine but mostly i m just exhausted and can t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon  which really doesn t help my whole not going to class thing i m just so stressed and have a constant headache i go to see my therapist later today which is good i guess but i just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my head  if anyone read this then thank you  i ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha ,1
who else desperately craves stable employment but has crushing anxiety and absolutely no idea what they want to pursue  i have had this realization lately and it is very crap    ,1
do you live with a person who always brings you down  i do and i hate my life because of it ,1
i desperately want someone to reach out to me  but when they do  i fucking hate it  anybody else do this  if so  why  and what the fuck   you find yourself leading a life of self imposed isolation  full of all kinds of self hate  wishing desperately for some kind of validation  help  or support of some kind  wishing your friends  or really anyone  would actually reach out and give a shit        and then when someone does  and offers help or support of any kind  you get extremely uncomfortable with the human contact  and all the emotional aspects that come with it  to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you   mattering   or   being worth something   and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone  thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do    seriously  what the fuck  i ve noticed this pattern in myself and i can t understand why    it feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that  it just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder  which logically i know makes it worse  but i can t seem to break the cycle   anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this  because i m at a loss here  ,1
sleep isnt just sleep anymore  its an escape   ,1
you can talk to me anytime people are just full of shit  like they say that i can talk to them anytime but then the next moment  when im no longer convenient for them  they dont respond for a day or too  or they dont actually want to talk and feel like theyve done their civil duty with that sick one liner    okay ive said my piece  back to the slums for me ,1
when developing a crush on someone  does anyone else get depressed as fuck  everytime i see a human being that makes my heart stop i get really sad because ive convinced myself that i will never  never be able to have someone like that   if anyone at all  ,1
im a grown man  almost       and i just want someone to sit and listen to me  and let me cry    and give me a hug  i made this account as an outlet  as i cant be open about these things irl   it feels weak  to crave sympathy  only a few people in my life know i struggle mentally  and those people were either pushed away by it or are gone  i try to carry myself best i can   confident  hard working  no bs type of guy  but its all a front  i wake up most mornings wondering if this is the day ill finally die and itll be over  im not confident  i dont love myself  i dont love anything  ive become jaded and cynical  i dont trust anything or anyone  any zest i had for life seems to have disappeared   i miss my mom  i miss her so goddamn much  i feel a stabbing pain in my heart when i think about my younger sister  she never got to have a mom  and our dad honestly just sucks  neither of us have a good relationship with him  he tried to dip out on us when we were young  hes a petty  pitiful excuse of a man who never intended to raise a family  i wish i were closer to my sister  but i think she struggles like i do and distances herself from people  although the truth is  were all we have in this world  my dads side of the family live on the other side of the us and are basically strangers  my mom was adopted and that side doesnt care about us   my mom was the strongest  most empathetic person ive ever known in my life  she was a saint  she wasnt perfect  but she always put others before herself  and i try to live my life in honor of her  i try to help people whenever i can  even if its to my detriment   so i dont talk about myself or how i feel  my mom taught me that the world doesnt revolve around me   but still  i so desperately want someone to hold me right now     edit  thank you all so much for the love and advice  ive tried to read every single one of your comments and take it all in  its a lot  i honestly didnt expect this post to get noticed at all  i was just pouring my heart out somewhere  i use reddit almost like a diary a lot of the time  and i never expect any response or sympathy  it just helps me to let my thoughts out   but wow    just hearing your stories and you guys reaching out to me to talk and everything    i just want you to know that it made my day today  i cant thank you all enough  i wish i could talk to all of you  there are so many good people on this planet and it really helps to see it first hand   my mom was a beautiful person  taught me all the good things i know  if youre a parent or plan on being a parent  just know how powerful and influential you are  you can totally guide and steer your childs life in a good direction and make the world a better place by adding another good person to it  the kid might rebel and take a while to get themself together  but theyll always keep what you teach them in their heart  ,1

anyone else  functionally depressed   you can still go to work school  spend time with friends and family  and act like a totally normal person but feel completely dead inside    im in school and i make decent grades  my friends go to karaoke bars regularly to hang out and drink  it feels so weird singing emotionally charged songs while feeling absolutely nothing  feels like living a lie  ,1
the saying  its a permanent solution to a temporary problem  kinda loses its meaning after    years of having the problem   ,1
the color is gone from the world everything is in shades of grey    childhood was so hard  it was where all my monsters were born  so to speak  but it was still very magical  i just wish i d never experienced that that magic because the loss has been so painful    i ve lost my sense of enjoyment and also a lot of physical and mental ability  chronic illness   i m relatively young but i feel stuck in an old  broken body and i can t wait until the day i m free of it  ,1
does anyone else feel like theres a voice inside your head  like an inner demon  telling you how much you suck and keeping you down all the time  its like  this inner demon wants to push me into his abyss and im holding with all the strenght i have but its been hard to hold on for much longer  i hate this demon  ,1
i often think depression is just realizing how the world really works   ,1
does anyone else welcome the idea of an accidental death  ive recently come to terms with my depression  ive contemplated suicide  but i dont think i will ever do it  but every day  when im driving to school  i have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me  i think thats just an excuse for my selfish desire to die  i think it would be better for my family  the memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved  i would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues  they would just say it was an unfortunate accident  does anyone else think like this  ,1
do you ever feel like youre just not cut out for this world  inb  comments like  youre just acting helpless  or  what makes you different from everyone else   im not trying to act helpless or like im different  i just feel like im too weak  there a lot of things that upset me that    shouldnt  like im terrified of confrontation  to the point where i start shaking  and i cant have arguments  everything makes me exhausted  after    minutes of badminton i couldnt breathe  even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache  its like i have no energy  i get so tired when doing schoolwork  and im very sensitive to what kind of advice i get  stuff like  tough love  gets me close to hyperventilating and ill be upset for the rest of the day  i just dont know what to do  and i admit it  sometimes i just want to quit  i guess i just have to try harder  but often i feel like im too weak and sensitive and i wont make it in the world  and that things would be better if i stopped existing   ,1
im not suicidal  but i genuinely just have no interest in anything  including being alive  im an atheist and i just dont think theres any reason to have to go through such a waste of time  breathing on this planet for another       more years  if it just means ill end up in the same place regardless of if i did something with myself or not   im currently not studying  and im looking for a job  i went to a job recruitment agency this morning  and they asked me a bunch of stuff that i was unable to give a proper answer to           so whats your dream job         shrug   er    i dont have one      well  if you had to pick a job what would it be    i really dont know    i guess one where i dont have to talk to people      it says here you were recently studying  can i ask what exactly you studied    i just graduated in social sciences      oh  thats great  we can help you get a job related to that       er    i dont really have any interest in the field      then if i may ask    why did you study social sciences      shrug   old fashioned parents expected me to go to university after school      okay  moving on    what are your long term or short term goals    er    i dont have any          i just started tearing up half way into answering the questions  thinking  somethings seriously wrong with me  that i dont have any goals or dreams  ive never been ambitious my whole life  even as a kid  when youre supposedly full of wonder and imagination  i never really had a  i wanna be a rockstar princess astronaut   moment   it was always just  i have to go to school cos i have to    i have to study hard cos i have to    i have to get good grades cos i have to   and now that im out in the world  i still havent figured out what the fucks the point of anything  ,1
does anybody elses mind immediately go to death as a solution  every time a new problem comes up  no matter how big or small  i sometimes cant help but think   this is such a pain  id rather be dead    for example  here recently i caused a minor car accident  and afterwards all i could think was how can i kill myself  because of the guilt and all my other faults  it almost scared me at how viable it seems as a solution  no more suffering  no more being useless  no more stupid mistakes    ,1
could we get a hands up of those who do absolutely  nothing  all day every day  those with no school or work    if you browse reddit    hours a day basically  ,1
people are too practical when it comes to depression so many people dont understand that sometimes  someone just wants them to understand what theyre going through  to be comforted emotionally instead of given practical advice  in moments of desperation i used to say stuff like  im a piece of shit i deserve to die  i dont need someone telling me im wrong  or what next steps i should take to feel better like exercise or eat healthy  i need someone to just say  im sorry you feel that way  that sucks  thats all i need  someone to acknowledge my feelings  trying to fix an emotional problem practically is like someone trying to fix a broken leg by talking  ,1
i get a horrible comedown after fun days of socializing  after good times with friends  i get home and feel exceptionally lonely and empty  maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect  i dunno  it stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even  good   ,1
i feel i am at the middle point where i dont deserve being labeled depressed and i am not happy enough to be labeled healthy dont misunderstand this title  please  i am by no means saying depression is any kind of privilege   suggesting you can use the depression card or whatnot  my point is that i feel my problems are irrelevant because i know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me  i feel i am not in a position to complain  yet  i dont feel content  i feel more apathy than much else and i dont know if that is depression and i am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis  some part of me believes i can solve this on my own  but another part asks   and how long will that take  considering your less than stellar situation  will and mindset    oh  and then theres the part which definitely thinks i shouldnt waste my time writing this  which in turn may waste your time by reading this  i am just confused and a little tired  i seek no sympathy from you guys  but maybe someone can relate  i wish you all a good day  ,1
i hate the depression cycle you know  the one where you hit  rock bottom  and you have a mental breakdown  talk to someone  and then suddenly feel motivated to do something about your shit self   until you eventually feel awful again  rinse repeat    it s very tiring   ,1
if we treated all illnesses  the way we treat mental  illness   ,1
ever get so depressed that you stop wanting to get better  im at the point where i dont really want anything in life  even happiness  i know logically i could probably get better if i put my mind to it  but that thought just doesnt appeal to me anymore  it sounds weird putting it out in writing  but i was wondering if anyone else can relate to this    thanks for reading  i hope you have a nice day  ,1
i feel the need to constantly distract myself with reddit  netflix  tv  etc because anything is better than being alone with my thoughts for more than a second  ,1

does anyone have literally   friends or people to talk to  yes  literally    i kno we like to say we are lonely here  but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to  even if its online    that being said i just havr to say that i am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound i often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak  even if i hate my voice and i find it grating   i am mostly okay with it   i think  sometimes it gets really bad  but i try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so i dont think about killing myself   edit  i want to thank everyone for replying to this  i had no idea it would blow up so much  i was very in my feelings when i made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself  i went to sleep and now i am feeling a little better    i promise i will take time to read all the replies and respond to everyone  i also want to thank everyone who sent me a private message  i will reply to those too  but at the moment i am just feeling overwhelmed cause i didint expect people to actually relate to this or reply  i know it sounds cheesy  but i just wish i could hug all of you  ,1
i fucking hate when that  wtf am i doing with my life  wave hits  and hopelessness that follows sometimes it hits me at      in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room  sometimes in  pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothing  i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me  its like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left  idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend  no job except working a part time job once a year  i worked a  nd one in construction until just recently  but was fired after    days because i was  not needed anymore   no girlfriend  that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly  where im from if youre in your   s and still living with your parents and youre not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly     of ppl i know are either in college  or having a job and a decent social life or all   at once  i have none  for the last   years of being a depressed shut in i didnt grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions  when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager  because i always tell the same jokes  do the same inappropriate things  talk the same     my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal  so happy  taking pic after pic from vacation  having beautiful girls  some getting married even  having decent jobs  a place of their own while i spend     of my time on reddit  youtube  facebook  watch tv shows  listen to music and play games sometimes  i cant see my life getting better because ive already tried some things and it didnt help  and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is    and still living with his parents and basically never goes out  plus i gained like    pounds in the last   months  so not only im socially anxious and depressed as hell now im also chubby on top of all that  the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day  visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends  i visit places where wed get drunk and go to night clubs during             then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home  i had a decent life back in high school  its like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral  i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard ,1
just became a father  and death sounds better every day     update     i just made an appointment to discuss therapy and or medication changes  ive been on this road before  pre baby depression  with a lack of results  but for the sake of my wife and child  im willing to try again  wish me luck everybody      end update     alright  parents and child lovers everywhere   get ready to hate me  i dont blame you  and really i dont care  i cant be unapologetically honest with anyone i know personally  so you strangers on the internet are the only outlet i can use   i have dealt with depression since middle school  so this bullshit isnt new to me  about   months ago  i and my wife had our first baby  and those two months have been the worst time of my life  i have been in dark places before  but becoming a dad has taken me to hellacious places in my mind that i never knew existed within me  for starters  i feel no love or connection to my baby at all  all i see is an obnoxious living ball of needs  i never wanted kids growing up  in fact  i have always hated babies and children under       years old  i only agreed with my wife to try for a baby because    my wife wanted a baby for most of her life  and i wanted to make her happy     i thought the parental instinct and unconditional love would come naturally when she was born and i started interacting with her   you always hear parents say that they love their kids more than anything  and they are worth all of the trouble they cause  but i strongly disagree  i want our baby out of my life until they are at least a teenager  maybe even forever   i am a very analytical person  and i have gone over all of the feasible options available to me  and they are all so fucking horrible to me that i honestly prefer suicide over facing the rest of my choices and their consequences   i love my wife with all of my heart  so the idea of divorce tears me apart even if it would let me be rid of our baby  i know what kind of life the two of them would live if we did divorce  and there is no way i could be that cruel  so i am essentially stuck staying in my marriage and keeping the baby  and i just have to suck it up and live with the worst fucking mistake i ever made  the idea of raising a baby  toddler  child  teen  etc is literally hell for me and experiencing it is proving to be worse than the idea alone  hence why suicide has started sounding so good   my depression has always seemed to revolve around the notion that  life takes too much effort work   which really fucking sucks since a baby is nothing but goddamn effort work  i am literally forced to care for and sustain the worst trigger i have ever encountered for my depression  the more i interact with my baby  the worse my mental health gets  the less i interact with my baby  the shittier i feel about what kind of father im being  which also leads to a decline in my mental health  no matter what i do  i am in a perpetual downward spiral   i dont want to hurt our baby  but i cant deny that the temptation arises when it wont stop crying  i find myself visualizing terrible things when i am desperately hoping it will shut the hell up   i cant even put all of the words down for some of my feelings lately  i feel so horrible about the way i see my own child and even worse about the fact i cant do anything to make it better   and before anyone asks  yes i have talked to my wife about this and to make a long story short  it didnt really help my mental dilemma  nothing got worse by talking about it  besides learning she hopes to have a  nd kid one day  hell no    but she did not have any input that i had not already thought of myself  ,1
does anyone elses body go into sleep mode when youre really depressed  ive noticed the last few weeks  ive been sleeping a lot more during the day than i ever have  especially after interacting with my dad  its not even something i can control  my body just shuts down for a few hours  the most infuriating part of it is that it screws up my sleep schedule  so ill struggle more than usual to sleep  ,1

i was depressed as a teenager  worked hard and got my own place and all the things i thought would make me feel better  and now im more depressed than ever in my mid   s  i cant maintain friendships  i cant connect with people  i push people away when i need them the most   it is so hard to describe the feeling and experience  i look forward to my free time  i plan and structure my life so i have it  but when i reach that point it is like ive gotten dumped off  with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips   i should be enjoying life more than ever  but i dont have a social structure to lean on  ive grown apart from my friends and family  i make plans for my days off with people  but when they come i cancel them   i just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows  the only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches  i probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for   minutes until it would stop moving completely and then i would smack it again  it was a boring  tortuous  and arduous experience but i wouldnt stop  ,1

does anybody here feel like they daydream all the time instead of living their life  like i said  daydreaming about the things id want to happen  about the things i can do  but wont  because of my social anxiety  which lead to my depression  daydreaming about having conversations with people i know that probably wont happen  daydreaming about not being lonely     its fucking exhausting  knowing that i cant make any of those dreams come true even though theres literally nothing holding me back  except myself  ,1
does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world  this world favors strong character  confidence  self respect  charisma  determination  fearlessness etc etc  obviously i dont add up to any of those  in fact im downright opposite  my life so far has been a history of failures and regrets  im so sensitive its honestly embarassing  at this point anything is enough to send me into an episode  im too fucking useless and repulsive to succeed anywhere in life  i find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world  where i actually have friends  where i dont loathe myself so much  where life doesnt seem pointless and i have a purpose ,1
when i see posts with     upvotes i can only imagine     people reading my posts and saying   lol  who the f ck cares      ,1
just saying  i have depression  feels like i m minimizing what i m actually experiencing i really hate it when i try to explain to people what s wrong and i don t want to go into the nitty gritty due to a whole slew of reasons but saying  sorry  it s my depression  just doesn t seem to convey the weight and magnitude this illness has  i need a new name or word for it   ,1
 send me a message if you ever need to talk  is one of the biggest lies ever   ,1

my wife committed suicide yesterday my wife was struggling with depression for about   months  she attempted overdosing in december  but i found out and called an ambulance  yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while i was out  i dont know why im writing this  it might be to prevent others from doing this  but i think it is a more selfish desire to just say it    i found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about      days because the side effects were unbearable  i dont mean to diminish this  but i believe it was mostly in her head  she operated normally as far as i could tell  but was fixated on this idea  i noticed she got worse recently but i believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work  i guess i was wrong     she thought i would be better off without her  that the pain i was going through watching her was too much for me  i truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me  i wish i could tell her how wrong she was    now i feel trapped  i dont see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but i also dont see suicide as an option  how can i put my loved ones through what im now going through  i can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct     edit  thank you all for your support  i promise that  despite the timing of this  it is not an aprils fool joke  i really wish it was    edit    thank you again for all the support  im going to see someone today and friday  the funeral is tomorrow  its going to be a rough few days   ,1
i think so too   ,1
i just want to die im just so fucking sick of being alive  im a complete failure at everything i do  all my close family members are dead and my best friend of   years has just disappeared from my life with no explanation  i feel that theres no point in continuing my pointless and shit life  theres absolutely nothing for me in this world anymore  no hope  nothing  ,1
i miss so very many people     ,1
i don t want to have kids because i don t want them to experience depression i m only     but i ve already made up my mind  i m never going to have kids  i can t stomach the thought of passing my depression down to them  or them having to grow up with a parent struggling with depression  it just wouldn t be fair to them  ,1
anyone elses okay days still pretty fucking awful  my okay days used to be decent  i wasnt particularly motivated or anything but i didnt feel like shit  now my okay days are just days where i dont actively want to die but i still have suicidal thoughts and cant stop thinking about depressing shit unless im fully distracted which is really hard to achieve   edit  thanks for all the words of support  its really helped and i feel much better now i know its not just me feeling this way  really appreciate it guys  ,1
i think ive been depressed for so long that           that its a part of my personality now  the helplessness and pessimism is such an integral part of my life that i now feel like i have to cling to it  to let go of it would be akin to forming a completely new personality  does that make sense  ,1
i m so uncomfortable when people ask  what have you been up to  every time i see them  it s hard fumbling about trying to think of something interesting when all i do is go on youtube  play video games and go to class  usually  i just go  not much how about you   it s embarrassing and sad  but it s not like i m passionate about anything else  i wish i was   edit  thank you for the gold  stranger   ,1
for each year that passes i always think  theres no way i can get more depressed than this  and i always surprise myself  beating my high score each year  ive never really had happy times in my life  but its been downward spiral since       i miss being the type of depressed where i actually had hope but i just hated my life    i miss hope  ,1
i relapsed  i made an oath to myself to never stoop so low and to cut myself again  i made it to two months without doing it until today  i had so many emotions going through my body and i didn t know what to do with it and so i just took it out on myself  i kept on going and going until i realize i had to stop because i almost covered my whole thigh  i m sorry for triggering or being to graphic to anyone  i m having a really hard time right now  ,1
anyone else fantasize about leaving everything  running away  and starting over somewhere  this has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years  im thinking  well  things cant get much worse  so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything  maybe go to a different country and starting over  ive been binge watching  disappeared  a lot and can really relate to many of the people who vanished all of a sudden  ,1
i wish i could donate my life to someone who actually deserves it a while ago i got into an argument with a guy because he implied that i was immature for complaining about being in college  he said   dont forget youre taking up space in a class someone else would love to be taking   even before i heard that  i felt like i was a waste of space and resources  but that of all things just made it so much worse somehow  ive wasted pretty much every gift ive been given and all i want is to die in peace but i cant even do that  ,1

do other people wake up happy  when i open my eyes in the morning  im never happy   i have to convince myself to get out of bed and do things  i have to force myself to try again  over and over  even though theres no point   i see other people and they seem happy  they say that they wake up and theyre excited about their day   when i wake up  i think   i have to do this today  i should do that today    when other people wake up  do they think   i get to do this today  im excited about doing that today    i try to be extra kind to myself in the morning cuz i know this is how my mind works  usually  late at night  like after midnight  im excited about life and i start planning the things im going to do tomorrow   then morning comes  and its awful  ,1

one of the worst parts of depression is when people get tired of supporting you  i was diagnosed with depression   years ago  my family was very supportive at the start  i had a girlfriend who loved me and i wanted to make her my wife   but the years have passed and my condition has not improved  people just start to get tired and see you as emotionally draining  this caused my girlfriend to leave me  my parents to get emotionally distant from me and my friends to disappear   now i am alone  miserable and suicidal  i have no one to talk to about this  my job sucks  my life sucks  and i see no way out of the miserable pit i live in   depression not only makes you hate yourself  it makes everyone else hate you as well   ,1
does anyone else feel shame in their depression because having it seems cliché and overused these days  im so tired of hearing  everyones depressed  and  other people have it much worse than you   like im completely aware my life should be great and now i just feel bad for complaining   are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more  i understand im not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because i cant control my emotions but also give me a break      edit  aw  guys  this has really blown up in just over    hours  im so glad none of us are alone and its truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view  i have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think im feeling  it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem  a chemical imbalance  rather than a bad few weeks  many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to  i kind of wrote this as a rant because ive been frustrated with my  support system  blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because im highly functioning  i go to work  i run errands  i see friends  but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep   you just need to sleep more   or  try to relax   or my personal favorite   have you tried meditating or yoga   ha  weve all been there    i still feel shame in admitting my depression  anxiety  or eating issues  because i do feel like im looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and id much rather fly under everyones radar  but i am getting help  ive been on medications for several years  and have seen therapists in that time as well  if you even think you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life  please go see a therapist  many places accept all kinds of insurances  including medicaid  so its completely free  please look into it  take care  friends     ,1

does anyone feel like they are faking every single human interaction  im a teacher and recently  have been told by management that i need to add more  excitement  to my classroom  because of this  ive been trying to play a more comedic role  telling jokes  and so on  today i realized that everyone i talk to    students  other teachers  or management  i wear this smiling face  nobody sees my true colors  at the end of most days  im left feeling exhausted  i dont know if i can teach anymore  when i get home i just shut down  curl up in a ball and feel finally like  myself      the only person who knows a little about my depression is my girlfriend  she knows i have  bad days  but doesnt realize it goes deeper than that   i wonder if anyone can relate to this  ,1

does anyone elses mind like to randomly tell you that you should die  does anyone else have those thing where like youre totally okay  nothing is happening to trigger it at the moment  but then your brain is just like  i want to die   its really friggin annoying because like i tried to reply to it  no i dont  but then it replies back  yes i do  and it just repeats until it drives me insane  its bad enough when i actually have something going on  but to have it on my few good moments days is really depressing because its like im never free from it  if you have this  what do you do to get it to shut up  additionally  whenever i do something stupid embarrassing not perfect  my first thought is always  kill yourself  even if its just like i cut some onions not evenly or i dropped something  its really disturbing and im so tired of it  how do you get this to stop  ,1
why do parents care more about school work than your mental state  i ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return  i ve been late on assignments  my parents know that i ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and i ve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue  it s because i m too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it  i  can t come up with anything to write because i m too focused on how bad everything is  they never ask me how i m doing  they ask me if i ve gotten any homework done yet  and i  just can t take it anymore   edit  my parents do care about me  i  know they do  they just don t understand how serious its becoming  i know they re trying to be supportive and understand what it is that i m dealing with and why i  haven t been focusing or wanting to go to school but it s hard to believe that sometimes when i  just feel like they re just trying to ignore everything that s happening  ,1
do you ever wish with all your heart that you never existed  have you ever hated everything so bad that you just wanted to be nothing   like literally nothing  just blank      its like the fear many people have of there being nothing but blank when they die  but for that nothingness to be your escape  ,1
do you guys feel like every little task is exhausting  so  i ve had major depressive disorder for over half of my life  do you guys ever feel as if every little task throughout the day is just exhausting  to the point where it feels like you need a break after accomplishing each one  for example  i know that i need to go grocery shopping  but even thinking about doing it is exhausting  so  i take a break after thinking about it  then  i make a shopping list  which is exhausting  so  i take a break after making the list  and now  i m faced with actually going to the store  which brings about a million other little exhausting tasks  for example  driving there  getting a cart  walking around  finding items  walking around some more  trying to control intrusive thoughts  walking around some more  then paying  then taking the shit to my truck  then driving back  then taking the shit out of my truck and into my apartment  fuck  so many fucking things  i m exhausted just thinking about it   update  dang  this post blew up  also  i did not end up going to the store  haha  ,1

its done  pills taken  you know  i went down my list of contacts  seeing whether there is anyone i would have liked to say goodbye to or say anything too really  nobody  not a single person  i told my wife i love her and she will be fine  both are true   edit update   i dont really know what to say  i honestly didnt think my post would be seen by anyone at all  i feel like now i owe everyone an update   i did take the pills  i ended up taking a cocktail of about    pills of varying drugs  i was planning on taking twice as many  but my wife walked in and saw me  i thought the room was securely locked  and freaked out and took all the rest  i was too out of it to even challenge her the benzos were kicking in hard  and she called the emergency line  ambulance picked me up  dropped me off at the hospital  and i was told i wouldnt be seen for   hours  uk hospital   the idea of having to wait that long just to be seen just reinforced my feelings of being totally rejected and low priority in society  i left  i got more pills and took them  i told my wife  and she wouldnt stop calling me and calling the police  she wouldnt stop calling and it drained my phone  literally the only thing i felt like doing was listening to my favourite songs as i passed  thats all i wanted  the closest place i could think to go was the hospital cafeteria  which was still relatively close  and i had a charger with me since i was expecting to spend some time in the er anyway  the sockets in the cafe were all disabled  but thankfully the socket in the hospital chapel was not  i spent about half an hour there charging my phone  and my wife had phoned half the city by that time  including my university support  as soon as i turned on the phone  i got a call from a private number that turned out to be the hospital asking where i was since they were ready for me  i admitted i was in the chapel  and thats where they found me huddled up in a corner  a nurse and   security guards saying they were there to help me  that was   hours ago  im still here and the hospital staff have treated me terribly ever since  i know that this sounds like its supposed to have some kind of happy ending to it  but quite frankly this entire experience has just been dehumanising and has made me realise that there should not be any more half measures  im not happy im still here  im a hostage and theyre forcing me to stay against my will  for my own safety   ive been through the er routine more often than i can count  but this time has been more nightmarish than i could have possibly imagined  one way or another  i will never be going back to the er again   on a more positive note  i cannot begin to thank or repay the many kind words ive received  my inbox is practically full  and in some ways so is my heart  it makes me feel guilty that i still feel awful  but i do  your words are so kind and sweet  but im still really struggling here  thank you all so much  ,1
has anyone else been depressed since they were children  i dont know if its even possible for children to have depression   everytime ive told a psych professional theyve laughed at me  the thing is  though  ive literally always been depressed  like  i hear people talk about how times were easier when they were younger and how they could go back to that time of innocence and all  but i never had that  maybe   maybe  in my first few years i was moderately happy  but from then on ive always been depressed  i just grew up too fast   does anyone else understand what i mean  ,1
do you ever feel like nothing matters because youll probably end up killing yourself anyway  why even attempt to self improve  ill probably fuck it up and make myself more miserable  and since im going to commit suicide anyway  theres no point in even trying  might as well continue down my self destructive path until i muster up the courage to end it all ,1
dear mods  can you please do something about the influx of tough love zealots on this subreddit  its a clear violation of the rules on the sidebar for anyone to advocate tough love bullshit  we need you to crack down on this  people are getting insulted  emotionally abused and put down daily  the tough love ideologues are really getting out of control  i dont know where they are coming from  they are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense  and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement  many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone  and extremely judgmental  harsh and condescending in content    we really need the mods to crack down on this  i also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here  i understand that you say that on the sidebar  but i request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner    there are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance   i strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love   i think its about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their dr phil reruns  ,1

the shittiest feeling is looking back on your day  and knowing full well you couldve done a lot  but you didnt  i couldve done so much today  i couldve finished work i shouldve been done with days ago and studied  but instead i did absolutely nothing  there were a few times where i tried to start my work  but instead just heavily procrastinated and browsed reddit and youtube all day   and look where i am now  i wasted the whole damn day  im on the brink of crying   and you know those occasional days that feel longer than usual days  where an hour feels like two  maybe three hours  it was one of those days  and the feeling like i had more time than usual today makes this feel so much worse  ,1

the robin williams posts are triggering  edit  my use of  triggering  in the title refers to how i felt reading articles and comments regarding robin williams on the night of  not the anger i felt the next day after having time to think and refresh    it angers me to see posts saying  if only robin williams knew how many people cared  loved him  are sad now   in my bouts with depression  i wouldnt have cared if   billion people sent cards saying they care  or    page letters  or a    hour phone call  id still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think   they dont really care  they just dont want my death on their conscience   id bet money robin williams was the same way  who could be more loved than a funny man    when someone tells me  in the context of suicide   id be sad if you died   i think   great  so i should endure my pain every day because you dont want to feel pain yourself   i think   how selfish   how is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain  its easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain  they dont feel it  they dont see it  because if i show it   hey  perk up  be happy  turn that frown upside down   depression isnt an on  off switch    and so i never want someone to do something they dont want to do  i can remember one time that all i wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend  but i couldnt bring myself to say that  i didnt want my friend to play just because i asked or out of some moral obligation   and i know that if i did  at the end id hear  do you feel better   as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me  less sad    instead i just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening  watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me    the robin williams posts are triggering  because they are filled with ignorant comments about  caring   if i die  millions will never know  much less billions  much less care as one  r self post proclaims  friends and family will move on  because their advice to me is always   keep putting one foot in front of the other  just let go of that bad stuff     obligatory edit  thanks for the gold  kind stranger  its my first  ,1
anybody else feel especially terrible on their birthday  it s my birthday today  and i feel way worse than usual  am i alone in feeling this way   edit  wow this post blew up  can t say i had the best birthday  but i very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one  and it definitely made me feel better  common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays  it is important to monitor your expectations  put yourself out there and be vulnerable  and know that it is common to feel this way  so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to  even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself  best wishes and thanks again for your support  ,1

does anyone get triggered by being yelled at  all of my life  getting yelled at has absolutely been the trigger to bring me to such a low  it s the feeling that i did wrong  and that i m useless and a fuck up that slowly grows darkness over me    i am not diagnosed with depression but i have bad anxiety and i know that they can go hand in hand to completely screw your life over    often  my moods fluctuate  i can have very high highs  where everything is good and i m feeling beyond great  then with a simple trigger i can sink into this deep sadness where i go numb and have no interest in doing anything    i m supposed to get a haircut today but i can t seem to get out of bed  this feeling is scary and i hope for the best for anyone who deals with this    you are all loved     one day at a time  ,1
rick and morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts ive ever seen on television so episode   of the new season  at the end  rick walks past his family  being a bit more quiet than usual  then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide  he passes out at the last second    when i see a suicidal person on tv i feel like   times out of    theyre standing on a bridge  weeping their guts out  waiting for someone to come along and talk them down  maybe theres a crowd watching them  cause thats what everyone wants at their suicide  an audience  now this obviously does happen  but i dont think its the majority of attempts  those might be more likely to be a  cry for help  scenario   which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide  if youre standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel thats the only way youre going to get help  then you are really desperate for help    anyway  for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesnt want anybody interfering  i feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down  family is home  they dont notice much different about the person  and its completed without a lot of fanfare  you just want it done  it reminded me of hunter s thompsons suicide  his adult son was in the next room and thought hed heard a book drop   rick is also one of the only characters i can think of that has depression and successfully hides it  he comes off as angry and mean  which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me  im angry all the fucking time  because im in pain and i want to die  and ive used up all the fucks i had to give just getting out of bed today  i have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid  still  most people who know me have no idea how sick i am until i tell them     rick and morty likes to make you laugh at something  then force you to think about why you were laughing  rick is a funny old drunk grandpa  old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and dont give a fuck are funny  right  except nobody drinks like that without a reason  healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk  the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption  also  most people just dont feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out    rick sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it  ,1

i don t want to kill myself but if i died right now  i wouldn t mind  i hate my life  i m stuck home with my depressed parents who make me feel guilty if i try to have a social life as though i should be at home moping around with them instead  it s gotten to a point i feel selfish for wanting to go out with friends and if i do  i m miserable  but i love being around people  i love talking and doing things with others but i can t anymore  i don t have anyone   ,1
do you ever feel like you have everything thats needed to be happy yet you are miserable anyways  i just wanna now if im not alone     edit    i really appreciate all your replies  i read them all and will keep reading   i can safely say feeling disconnected from everything is what makes us the most damage  despite having all of our basic needs satisfied  i guess we all have to learn how to survive with this instead of fighting it  and sharing our thoughts here helps with that a lot   regards to everyone and thanks again  ,1

my dad spilled boiling hot tea all over my lap  serious second degree burns  i love my dad but he gets super mad when i don t do as he asks  i was drinking some green tea when i was arguing with him   he hit  the cup i was holding and suddenly the worse pain ever was all over my thighs and stomach    it s been   days since then  the doctors said it s really bad but might not scar  i m in so much pain guys i honestly wish he just killed me that night instead  i had to clean my wounds and it was so horrifying seeing your own raw flesh it s just not meant to be seen man    worse day of my life  i m not able to move out of bed at all currently  i m feeling like shit atm  i just want to say that i hope you guys are getting through life better than i am  i don t know if i ll ever feel safe in my own house ever again  i ve had sleep paralysis every night since of the incident  look all i m saying is i really hope you guys are having a better day than i am  please make sure your eating well and taking as much care of yourselves as you can   edit  okay so this got way more attention then i wanted  but thank you so much for everyone with their well wishes and support  i was overwhelmed when i woke up to this  i truly was  and i was scared in a way to address all of this    firstly  if you guys want to see my wounds as you guys dont seem to be believing me  i will post a picture of the bandages  or if you guys want to see my actual wounds  i am willing  as i am getting the bandages changed at the hospital today  this post  more than anything  has made me realize that this sub is sacred to people that are going through bad things  i would never post a fake story and take up anyones time  i understand why you guys would be suspicious  and i am willing to do whatever to prove myself  the reason i posted this was because i felt like shit and alone  and i needed to justify the pain i was going through  so i wanted to kindly ask people to be grateful for what they have  as it can always be worse  myself in this very moment included  instead  almost a thousand people have heard me  and have supported me  funny thing is  ive actually missed some resits for uni because of this and i might have to retake a year  and this thread has made it feel much less worse   secondly  my father  hes a good man  but this is the last time  he has promised to me  i belive him  i think the world of my parents  but things wont ever be the same between us  this is the last time  i love him  but this is too much    thank you all for your support  it means everything to me i honestly had no one at that moment  but i feel so loved  thank you all  ,1
for me  depression isn t overwhelming sadness  it painfully boring apathy  lethargy  dysphoria  melancholy    they all just make life so dull   sometimes i think i experience it differently from a lot of people  but i also know it s a fairly common feeling   i m not really seeking advice  just venting and probably seeking some validation   edit  apparently i failed to spell check the title    i blame the apathy  ,1

does anyone feel like depression stops them from being the person they were born to be  but then feels guilt and anxiety about trying to become that person  i swear depression is one paradox  you start on level one  depression goes to level two  you go to two and depression goes to three  in the meantime you tell your self a bunch of bullshit to act like depression isnt taking over and ruining your life but it is  no one understands how awful it is  depression is a life stealing shitshow  there is not rock bottom  it always gets worse  whenever you think your at the lowest  it goes lower    growing into or enjoying yourself is impossible  depression has made me a walking idiot   your    of your former self   it makes me want to cry    ,1
does anyone else feel like they can no longer feel their own emotions  but instead have just learned to mimic those of the people around them in order to seem  normal   i seriously do not remember the last time i felt an emotion that was my own  beyond the alternating crushing ennui and bone deep sadness that is the depression    any  normal  emotions  happiness  laughter  excitement  even just normal neutrality  all of those are foreign to me  i only  feel  them when im near someone else who is feeling them  and thats only because ive learned to mimic the behaviors associated with each emotion while in a social setting so nobody will ask whats wrong with me    is this a thing other people do  or am i just really fucked up  ,1

no social skills  no romance  no love  no hope for the future  im a    year old male and ive been struggling with depression for the past    years of my life  it keeps getting worse one day at a time  ive always had severe social anxiety and did what i could to avoid talking to people  i tried dating a few times in my life but the relationship wouldnt last more than a few weeks  i would be extremely nervous and wouldnt know what to say but i would tell myself that every other guy on the planet can do this so i can too  it finally dawned on me that i have no social skills and cant hold conversation to save my life  you might think im over exaggerating but youd be wrong  i really cant think of anything to say  even if you were to give me a list of things to say im not intelligent or quick witted enough to hold a   min conversation let alone hours upon hours of talking to someone im interested in  its like my mind is a blank slate the never got programed  i tried therapy and meds but i finally realized its hopeless  there is something severely wrong with my brain  i hate myself so much and i would do anything to be a normal guy with a normal love sex life  i have a bunch of other problems that make me depressed but ive already written enough here  if you actually read all this  thanks for listening to me vent  ,1
the most depressing thing about mental illness is knowing you will never be the person you were before everything went wrong  i was terribly insecure as a child  i had all the qualities society deemed negative and my parents never let me go one day without reminding me  i was  and still am  shy and introverted  i have struggled with my weight my entire life  i had acne as a teenager and have acne scars now  i was consistently being told that i wasnt creative  that i was bad at every subject there was  but when i got to high school and found a subject area i was passionate about  and decently good at   i was so happy  yes  im ugly and timid but i can scrape decent grades if i put in the effort  this is something i can be good at  and that gave me enough confidence to step out of my comfort zone a bit   and then i got to college  and everything went downhill   i struggled with homesickness and loneliness that stemmed from having trouble socializing with others  and that had a negative impact on my grades  so now  not only was i ugly  fat  not creative  etc   i was also being told i was lazy  professors that i reached out to told me to stop partying and to actually go to class  what they didnt know was that i attended every class  did every homework assignment  read the textbook multiple times  i just for some reason couldnt scrape something higher than a b    my self esteem plummeted  as did my self confidence  everyone around in me in college  and everyone i knew from high school  are so intelligent  so talented  and so beautiful  there isnt a single person that i cant come up with multiple positive qualities of  except for myself    i wouldnt say i was in a good head space back in high school  but i was definitely wasnt depressed  but now  after multiple sessions with a psychologist  im afraid ill never be the person i was before i was diagnosed  this doesnt seem like something that can be cured  rather something i have to deal with and manage my entire life    sorry for the rant  i just needed to get this off my chest so that i can put it aside and go study for finals  sending love to everyone who is struggling with depression like i am  ,1
i hate sleeping because it makes tomorrow come sooner  ive noticed that a big symptom of depression that a lot of people have is excessive sleeping and depressed people often view sleeping as an escape  but for me  the thing i always dread most is tomorrow  i hate getting up and having to face the day  regardless of whether i slept  and sleeping makes it come so much faster  i dont know  does anyone else feel like this  or am i just weird ,1
anyone else love sleeping and are sad when they wake  im happy when ive been sleeping  no worries or cares from this life to bother me  then  i wake up and am sad  sad because im still alive  sad because im still the same me  all of the other issues in my life that make me depressed come back to mind and the joy that sleep brought slips away so quickly   ,1
i turned    today  and nobody cared no calls  no cards  no emails   nothing  its a big birthday  i always thought id be surrounded by my loved ones on my   th birthday  but not one of them ever calls or writes or sends even a christmas card to me  one day im going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they havent seen me for awhile  then they will all act so sad    i remember at my fathers funeral  some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was  i looked at him and said  who are you   and then i asked him  if he was such a good friend  why dont i know you  im his daughter and ive never seen you in my life    when i die  nobody will come to my funeral  nobody will give a rats ass that i am dead  thats why im donating my body to science   update  just want to thank everyone who posted well wishes or shared their life stories  i wish i had more time to answer all the replies  it really did lift my spirits  though  so you did what you intended to do  this is one reason i love reddit and why i love young people  they really have such good hearts  but i think maybe they dont want to face their own mortality quite yet  so they tend to turn away from older folks like me  i was the same way when i was younger   anyway  thanks again   ,1

forgetting that not everyone is depressed do you ever just be talking or joking to someone about depression and they give a really shocked and worried reaction and its like damn  some people for real just dont think about killing themself all the time  thats crazy   like sometimes i forget that its not normal to want to die all the time  and normal people dont have those thoughts  ,1
does anyone else ever feel   embarassed after opening up about their depression to someone  i do feel relieved that someone knows now but i also feel kind of embarrassed that they had to see that side of me  i just feel vulnerable  ,1
anyone else almost non functional when they have freetime  i recently got a    hour a week job  its been great  i wake up  go to work  go to sleep  repeat  when i am there i listen to music or a podcast and then i go home  once i get home  on the weekends  i am almost non functional  i want to die so bad right now and the voices are once again coming back full force  beating me down to the point where i cant focus on anything  i just want to cry and sit in bed  or stab myself repeatedly with a knife  instead i sit in front of a computer and game for as long as i can  most of the time i am completely alone with my own thoughts on the weekend    even now my mind is yelling at me  i dread the weekends   ,1

i fear that i use depression anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities  hello everyone  first off  as im sure is the case for most of you  this post was extremely hard to write  i dont like complaining about my depression anxiety because life is stressful for everybody  i am in a pretty good situation overall  with a good family  great girlfriend  great friends  and a nice apartment  yet  despite all that  i feel so incredibly shitty most of the time  it makes me feel guilty   why should i feel like crap when i have it so much better than probably     of the world  yeah  everyone gets stressed by work  traffic  money  etc but its called life    these are thoughts i have all the time which is why i dont like to talk about my feelings much  i see a therapist and i dont really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me  but i absolutely hate talking about it otherwise  the thought of making my problems other peoples problems is horrible to me    another thought that i have is do i just use depression anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities  like am i just not mature enough to deal with real life so i can just say to myself  hey im depressed so its okay that i dont give maximum effort   i am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating   i often just think im incredibly lazy and that i use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed  has anyone had these thoughts before  and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit   im brand new here   i just dont feel like im cut out to deal with the real word  i dont have whatever  it  is to be successful professionally   between social anxiety  inability to concentrate  and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive   anyway  thanks for reading  i know this is a giant ramble  glad to have somewhere i can just write down all my incoherent thoughts ,1
one day  that quiet kid will commit suicide one day  that quiet kid will commit suicide  and come his funeral  his parents and siblings will be crying  but none of his classmates will say a word because they never spoke to him  they will remember the times their eyes moved past him as if he were part of the wallpaper  how many times they forgot he was in the room  isnt it tragic that the only time they remembered he was with them at all was the day he left the world    good luck to you  fellows  who are like me  depressed and lonely  and waiting for the end of it to come  ,1

does anyone else feel like they re in a trance  of sorts  as if they re just floating through life   which feels intangible in itself   with very little or no purpose  that s the best i can explain how i feel  i guess  it s odd  but the only thing i ve felt for a while now  so is strangely comforting due to its consistency  i feel as if i m very detached from my own body  and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine  human person   my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it s inhabitants   that it s all fake  in a way  and everything is very much temporary  having no long lasting impact   probably doesn t help this feeling  it s not a lack of awareness  i m almost hyper aware of everything  sometimes called creepily observant   i don t know how to describe it  really  just a constant state of being  out of it    i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way  let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other     edit  wow i forget how awful of a typist i am  i must learn to proofread for the amount of typos i make haha  edit ii  i m surprised this post has gained so much recognition in such a short space of time  although it s sad that a lot of us seem to be struggling with this  at least we re not alone  ew  cheesiness   edit iii  some people seem to think i m a guy in the comments  which is fine  i don t mind    but i wonder why because i m a girl haha  thank you again for all the upvotes and comments on this  ,1

today i woke up without hitting the snooze button  actually made myself coffee  did homework i could have put off  and showered standing up  i feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy  even though i know that tomorrow morning i might disappoint myself  i won todays battle  try to remember that every proactive thing you do  no matter how small  like making coffee  is a huge personal success     to clear things up  i have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower energy which results in longer  depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be   edit  so happy to see that my post has inspired others and thank you all for the congratulations and encouraging words    this subreddit is truly a wonderful and supportive community ,1

anyone else feel like you have to be physically ill to make people realize you re mentally ill  i have depression since childhood and nothing has ever been done until i cut my wrist once    i hate selfharming  i never had an urge to do it  but it did feel like something you had to do to  prove  you re depressed  especially when you re a teenager  if not  you re seen as someone who s just sensitive and complains a lot  other illnesses like anorexia also seem  necessary  to have to make people finally realize that you re mentally unwell    even my own parents saw my suicidal thoughts as an afterthought at first  when i confessed to my teachers about my selfharming  they finally tried to find a therapist for me   ,1

anybody else just used to being depressed and accept thats how it is  ive reached that point in my life  where not feeling depressed feels weird to me   im just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh  that to actually think of life without depression just makes me roll my eyes   like that will ever be possible   i can never just be happy   there always seems to be some sort of catch   happiness seems to come at a price   ive also noticed that after feeling happy  that i just  crash  hard back into depression and i feel worse than before   i sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug   the high is amazing and uplifting  but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness     im also anxious     of the time  even when i have no responsibilities or things to worry about   i could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack   i dunno  this might all just be me   i just wanted to vent  ,1
the internet has turned depression into a meme and i hate it  its practically impossible to have a serious discussion about it with anyone because if you say youre depressed and feel like dying theyre always like  lol me too xd  ,1
 the best way to describe depression is the inability to construct a future  read this off a youtube comment   edit  i hope whoever reads this could still find a smile  even tho it s hard  even when the sky doesn t seem bright  i hope you guys could do things without fear taking a grip on you   will see the sunlight  hope  you guys are safe  take care ,1

being african american and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is i just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesnt discriminate when it chooses its victims  i am just speaking from my perspective   in no way am i saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background  but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a real issue  from my personal experience and those of other black people i know  majority of us grew up being told that  were being ungrateful  weak  crazy or sad for no damn reason   i am sure that other people have been told these things as well  but this is all too prevalent in the black community   recently  i have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus  i was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist  after the school year ended  i came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor  but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me  the claim that  going to doctors is what the world does  theyre pretty religious   all they want to do is put people on pills   that is the furthest thing from the truth  not once did the man i met with suggested that i be placed on any sort of medication and even if i were  i would be willing to if i needed it   i hate that i am nothing like my family  if i believed in god  they would be more accepting of me  but i am at the point in my life where i feel that i want to believe in what feels right for me  i want to be my own person  not who anyone else wants me to be   i just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that acknowledging mental health is not a bad thing   update  i thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments  in the place of  african american  i originally had  person of color  because i am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups  this was basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eyes to what other groups endure  stay strong everyone  no matter where you come from  no matter what you look like  your problems do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real  i am proud of you all    ,1

idk the thing is  you don t want to sleep  but you don t want to be awake  you don t want to eat  but you don t want to be hungry  you don t want to be around people   but you don t want to be alone  you don t want to do anything  but you don t want to do nothing   what you really want is to stop existing  but you can t do that without dying  and you don t really want to do that either  ,1

ive always had trouble articulating the severity of my depression  so i made some photographs that describe it instead  thought you might enjoy  ive always struggled with depression and anxiety  but the past year or so its become a serious problem for me  i started seeing a therapist and started medication  and its helped me tremendously  however  trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult  how do you articulate something that youve had your whole life  its not like i really knew the other side  so to speak  it was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously   so i made some photographs  all self portraits  that aim to describe how i feel  ive always been a more visual person anyway  hopefully others find some type of comfort in this  let me know what you think    link to the pictures  http   edwardandrew tumblr com post             last year i posted a small series of images that  ,1
does anyone else feel like that theyve become a shell of their former self  i feel like over the years  through a mix of some events that shook me  and secluding myself in my room  that im no longer the person i once was  i seem to have lost my personality completely  i dont act the way i used to  i rarely have anything to talk about and i can no longer make people laugh  i also feel myself becoming too cynical of recent  and im starting to think ive become unlikable       i have always been an awkward person  but as of recent i feel everything has just gotten so much worse  ,1
my interpretation of depression   watercolor  x     http   i imgur com d  zage jpg ,1
the only upside to having both anxiety and depression is that depression keeps me from doing things that will trigger the anxiety  and the anxiety keeps me from actively trying to kill myself  i didnt know how to phrase the title to make it shorter  but i am realizing this right now as im in the middle of a crisis  im depressed  suicidal  but also pretty anxious  especially socially anxious  and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety  because i dont live alone  i feel like i wouldnt be able to kill myself without panicking  i dont want to be seen  i dont want to be acknowledged  the attention i would get alive  unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if i think about it now  just thinking about it makes me panic  and by trying to avoid the anxiety  i try not to think about my death    while the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time  yay  apathy and anhedonia    which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack    so i guess thats a good thing  isnt it       edit  oh wow  you guys  i was not expecting all of this at all  i wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown  while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning  im sorry it took me so long to come back to this post  but thank you so much for the replies  i have read all of them  and will reply  i hope all of you have a great  great day  lets keep our heads high     ,1
i got fired   i dont want to start over i just got fired from my job at the end of my shift  i worked hard at that job and the only reason why i got fired is because i stood up to my boss who was speaking to me like a child and berating me every shift  she made it seem like we were all good and then the next day i got the boot  not sure why this keeps happening to me  it seems like the more kind that you are  the worse you are treated by society and im not cut out for this dog eat dog shit in the city    i honestly am so tired and lost  im going to pick myself up by the bootstraps but im utterly exhausted with constantly having to start over  any words of encouragement will help  i have been in denial of the fact that i am now jobless again   america  is it still the dream it once was  when stuff like this happens to thousands of people every day  it doesnt feel like it     edit  thank you everyone for your support  currently still laying around avoiding job searching but your kind words give me hope  also the company was the boys and girls club of america  im going to contact corporate soon and state my case  backed by evidence  nothing may come of it but my boss deserves a slap on the wrist at least because what she did was wrong  ,1
anyone else been depressed since childhood  i dont see it being discussed much  it makes me feel rather isolated  i dont think i even remember joy  i only seem to recall fear and deep sadness    ive been depressed since i was    i suppose i was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family  a lengthy move across the pond  and the bullying that went with being the new  weird kid at school triggered it  an inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably  most people my age  im turning    next month  seem to be so excited about life  but i only feel helpless  i am exhausted at this point in life  and feel like i can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world    depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me  i have a rather vapid life with a personality to match    id be open to read your experiences and feelings    edit  wow  words cannot describe how relieved and elated i feel to know that i am not alone  all of you have dealt with such terrible experiences i wish no one had to go through  i wish all of you nothing but the best  i am exhausted on all planes of existence  but i will use what strength i have to carry on  we must all move on   ,1

i m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and i m a little freaked so bit of a story i m    i ve never been to therapy or anything like that and i ve known for a while that i probably should have a long time ago  a little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if i was open to trying to get some professional help to which i said yes  so my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point    when she came back the next day she asked if i minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again  explore our options   when she returned she told me that some people from an organization called cope are coming in about an hour and if i had a problem with it i had    minutes to decide if i wanted her to call them off  now i have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn t sit very well  yet when i told her this she argued with me about how  what i was doing hasn t been working  and  if we don t do this then what are we going to do   like i thought that s what today was for   basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice  don t get me wrong i want help but i kind of thought it d be on my terms   so fast forward to today where the people from cope scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me  i have no idea what to expect and that s what s kind of freaking me out  like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately  what kind of questions is she going to ask  anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated  even if it doesn t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story i d still like to hear your input   tl dr i m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out  looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice   edit  wow  just wow you guys  i didn t know what to expect when i made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much  you all gave such good advice i was so much more at ease going in to this  i just got back home from it and for those who are interested i feel like it went well  she seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than i expected  she did recommend me to start taking medication to which i did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we ll see how it goes  i m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well  thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and i feel a lot better about things  ,1
knowing that i can kill myself is the only thing that keeps me relaxed  so  as in the title  one of the few things that makes me not fall in complete despair is knowing that i do have this way out  just want to know if anyone knows what im talking about  like  it came to a point where thinking about suicide actually comforts me enough to not do it  am i a idiot for thinking this way  ,1
im  the funny guy   i instinctively put on this act to make everyone laugh  yet i really want someone to just see through my bullshit and understand how deeply sad i am  when im around other people  i laugh boisterously and crack jokes like its my fucking job  people think im this confident  hilarious guy who enjoys the fuck out of life  of course  i cant blame them  i mean  im full of shit  thats the image i project  i cant help it  i just do it without thinking about it  but all i really want is for someone to understand the crippling melancholy that forms the foundation of all my jokes  i want someone to see through it all and just acknowledge how fucking hopelessly sad i am  the hilarious thing is that all it takes is a bit of honesty  yet honesty feels completely unnatural to me  i cant be honest about my feelings  i just cant  i can face a wall and tell it about how miserable i am  but replace that wall with an actual human being  and suddenly it becomes impossible  i  pay  my therapist to listen to my true feelings  but as absurd as it is  i cant even bring myself to tell him just how dark my inner world has become   im sad  internet strangers  im really fucking sad  all the time   ,1

litter saved my life  i was in my car this morning ready to kill myself  or at least trying i always chicken out   i went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so i wouldnt have to take anyone with me  thats when i drove by this massive littering is illegal sign and guess what  theres a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign  at this point i was beginning to somewhat calm down  i turned around and parked on the side of the road  i picked up litter for about       mins in the hot southern sun  luckily i had a cheap duffel bag i wasnt using  felt like i lost a pint of sweat  my fatass sweats a lot   after that i just got in my car and drove home  its kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me   edit  thanks for the gold ,1

i wish i could give my life span to someone that was taken too early that deserved to live  i just watched the andy whitfield documentary be here now  he was the title role of spartacus in the starz series years back  the show was a hit and he was no doubt destined to do great things moving forward  but he was suddenly diagnosed with lymphoma cancer and died    months later  he left behind a beautiful wife and two children  he seemed to have been a decent and talented guy all alround and did not deserve to die   im just a    year old pos working a crappy job and getting drunk every night  im short and ugly and will never find a women to start a family with  why did a great guy like andy have to die instead of me  fuck cancer  ,1

does anyone feel like they re not going anywhere in life  i ve felt like this for quite some time and can t quite shake it off  ,1
i dont see the point in being honest about my feelings with my family if all they will do is be angry at me for feeling the way i do the title pretty much explains it  i dont understand the point of being honest with anyone if people give you dumb answers regarding the way you feel  yeah they might actually care and thats their genuine answer  but perhaps i dont care about their dumb answer  i think ive become basically just numb  i dont want people to know how i feel because they just act angry towards me  what goes through peoples minds  i could understand frustration because you feel unable to help me  but people act angry towards me  i dont want to ever talk with my dad regarding my mental state if all he does is be angry at me   edit  thanks for all the support and compassion  i thought i was an idiot for feeling this way but lots of you guys experience the same  i wish you all the best and hope things get better for everybody    ,1
wife is dying and i feel so lonely  ive suffered with depression all my life  i was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like i didnt fit in  my wife was the same  and when we found each other we found more than a spouse  but someone who could relate  i cant describe my love for her  we complete each other   around   years ago she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer for the second time  at age     whilst she was pregnant with our daughter  we lost our daughter to stillbirth  but my wife somehow pulled through  had chemo and got an all clear   during this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish  useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did  after four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track   last month i took my wife to a e because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control  only for them to tell us  after a few more tests  that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned  somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do   she is due to start chemo soon  and is in an awful lot of pain  she has been prescribed morphine for it  but due to that spends most of the time sleeping  while i sit here and watch over her  making sure she is ok   the trouble is i cant talk to her about any of this  its too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but im devastated and alone  besides  how i feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and i dont want to put that on her   i feel like im already grieving her even though she is still here  im completely alone with no one to lean on for support   ive already lost so much and i dont know how i am going to cope when im here alone  i feel like ill probably just see out my cats life and then take my own  nothing feels worth doing if i cant share it with her  ,1
that fucked up moment when you realize even suicide is not an option  when you cant come up with an answer to  what to do   question   when nothing is getting any better but you still keep on going for no particular reason   when you ran out of hope and started to exist like a zombie    fuck  im really feeling like shit   ,1

a letter to my daughter  from my depression dear daughter    i hope you never have to really read this letter  i think it s more for me than it is you  you re only   right now and i know you can t understand why mommy cries   why mommy has a hard time just opening her eyes   wake up mom  she says  but mom is in a dark place  a hole where the sun can t shine  a nameless place one where mom doesn t even want to see her own face   you see today is a bad day  and it hasn t even started  mom is angry and mom is sad  and baby doesn t know why   am i really that bad    but you see sweetheart  it was never you   you see mommy has a condition that no one can physically see but it hides inside her   like the deep  dark sea sometimes the waves ravage inside her  and she just doesn t want to go out in the world she doesn t even want a reminder  don t tell me what time it is cuz some times she feels it would be easier to  turn time off  but gracie just wants to go play  mommy is too busy drying her eyes  what s wrong momma   but mommy doesn t even really know  the tears ebb and flow while her heart just races  mommy looks in her baby s eyes  and baby girl just knows she s hurting as mom tries to disguise  all that is going on  baby girl wonders    what s really wrong    because mom lives with depression and anxiety there really is no disguising  most days she tried to put on a smile  reads a little positivity and tried to climb the ladder out of the hole choose the latter   i m writing you this letter to show you mommy knows i know how hard it must be to live with me because mommy lived with it too  i watched my mother  cry and sink and eventually even falll down the gutter  to the dark places no one wishes to wander   you see i never understood either  as a child i just wanted to be good for her  and never wanted to make her sad   just as i see in your eyes   please know mommy s trying and i would never contemplate dying for that would mean life with out you and darling you are the sunshine to my dark moon ,1

its so hard to get out of bed  ive spent   hours lying on the bed this afternoon  its so hard to convince yourself because theres nothing to look forward to  nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self care  its easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self hatred  sexuality  all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation  its so hard when you have no emotional support  nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you  step by step    nobodys listening   im aware that i cannot and should not rely on other for validation  and i cannot seek their help all the time  im aware that only i can change things  but as soon as im trying to be independent  everything just falls apart immediately    why am i like this  i just want the demons to go away  i dont need to be happy  i just want this to stop  ,1
i m a lunch lady at an elementary school school  they just cancelled school for two weeks  but food service workers will still be reporting to work  at first i was mad that i would still have to work when everyone else gets two paid weeks off  but then they explained that the reason food service workers will still be expected to report for work is that we have a lot of kids in our district that qualify for free school lunch  for a lot of these kids  the food they get at school may be the only meals they get during the week  we have to keep feeding these kids  not only because they deserve to eat  but also because if they aren t eating  their immune systems will take a hit and they could be more at risk for covid       even though i would love two weeks off to rest  i feel proud to be a lunch lady and to be feeding these kids who need it    edit  wow  wow  wow  i really didn t expect this post to get so much attention  thank you all so much for your kind words and encouragement  i posted this with the intent to let people know that kids from low income families will be fed  at least in many places that are closing schools  because i know it s been a topic of concern for a lot of people  i certainly didn t expect to be called a hero  it s a little overwhelming and i m not sure i deserve the title  i m doing my job  i love my students  every day i see the same kids come in  i know most of them by name  i ve had little kids who have had a hard day come in with tears in their eyes but light up when they see their favorite lunch being served  i ve given many a high five to kids who let me know that they tried a new food yesterday and liked it  i ve tied so  so  so many little sneaker shoelaces    originally this job was just a stepping stone  a job to make money because i fell on some hard times  i fell out with my parents and left their home on bad terms  lost my previous job suddenly  and worst of all dropped out of college because i couldn t afford it  i was going to school to become a kindergarten teacher and when i saw the job opening for a lunch lady  i figured it was worth a shot  better than unemployment  not only has it been so much more rewarding than i ever imagined  it has really cemented how much i want to continue my education somehow to become a kindergarten  st grade teacher  my love for these little ones  even on the worst days  is overwhelming  the thought of them going hungry hurts my heart and soul  to the core of my being  so  of course i will do my best to feed them when their parents are struggling to make ends meet    thank you so much for all of you who have shared your stories with me of how the lunch ladies and gentlemen have touched your life  i ve smiled and cried so much since i posted this  i m truly touched by the response    edit     well  this post sure got more attention than i expected it to  im really happy to see so many people sharing stories about their experience with lunch ladies and cafeteria staff  its a great reminder of why we do what we do  ive noticed a lot of people have been asking questions  so let me answer them the best i can    im in virginia  usa  chesterfield county  specifically     while schools are closed  kids can get their meals without having to go into the schools or be exposed to potential illness  we are doing a drive up  curbside pickup system to minimize exposure  i have heard of other places also doing a delivery system so families without transportation can still receive meals    i know that it is appalling that in america  a first world and developed country that is home to some of the wealthiest people on the planet  children are still going hungry  its appalling that there are parents having children they cant afford to feed and clothe  right now  neither of those things are my focus  my focus is not to judge these parents or delve into the politics of how this has been allowed to happen  my goal is to make sure that no child in my district is going hungry because schools are having to close due to covid        if you want to help in your own community  there are some options you can look into  first of all  reach out to your own local schools  see what they need  ask them how you can help  reach out to food banks in your area  check in with sources like feeding america and see whats being done in your area to help out    enough people have reached out to me and asked if i have a gofundme  or have talked about starting one for me to go back to school and achieve my dream of being an elementary school teacher  so i went ahead and made one  please  nobody needs to feel obligated to give me anything  but i have learned not to question kindness and generosity  here is the link  if anyone is so inclined   https   www gofundme com f help this lunch lady become a teacher utm source customer utm medium copy link utm campaign p cf share flow   ,0
this coronavirus things has made me realize people would be a lot happier and explore their passions and interests if they didn t have to work so much  just live streams of people at home getting in touch with their instruments again  walking their dogs  etc   people actually seemed to be hanging out with each other  even if it s just playing my heart will go on or blowing a spitfire ball from the balconies   i get some people are mad or concerned because of cut hours   or just plain laid off   but if they   and everyone   had the means to the basics of just surviving and being alive it makes me yearn for that society where everyone is happy   pre  coronavirus i realized a lot of us work out butts off for very little reward   edit  hey thanks for all the awards guys  edit    i get that things are stressful on the other hand with it being a pandemic after all  but it s made realize people would be a lot happier once they ve achieved financial independence   viruses aside  ,0
i befriended a guy at work that a lot of people look down on and make fun of and it is changing my life  there is a guy near my cubicle at work who is probably the happiest  most caring person i know from how i have interacted with him since he got hired a month ago  i sat with him a lot to teach him his job and he was assigned to the same team as me   a lot of people have called him weird and made jokes about him  even the head of the department has made comments about him while he was in earshot  he is always staying active  he does yoga in the parking lot  and if he is tired on his lunch he we still on his car  not in   definitely a bit strange but i dont think he deserves to be treated that way for emphasizing physical and mental health   i am a bit overweight so a week ago i asked him if i could join him and if he could help me excersize  it turns out he has a bachelors and a masters in exercise science which was super cool  he taught me how to stretch properly and prepare for a run  we then ran and i completed my first mile in under    minutes  i know this sucks  and a total of     miles with stops to stretch and to slow my heart rate down  running a  k in segments i did not think possible  he let me set the pace and was super encouraging the entire way  he also explained his freshman year he was overweight as well and someone dragged him out and got him to excersise  once we finished he said i should join him again next friday as that is his  recovery  day  i got home and felt amazing  i then check my messages and this guys has made a custom workout plan for me for the next two weeks with a note saying after i accomplish that he will see where i am and adjust it  he also put in his notes that my short terms goals should be a half marathon and long term should be a marathon  i teared up a little that someone i barely new was willing to put a lot off effort and commit to getting me in shape   tldr  the guy everyone was making fun of is now my personal trainer and apparently has the credentials to do that as well   update  thanks you so much for the conversation in the comment below and for all those shiny award things  i have not gotten those before  i am surprised this blew up as much as it did  i have been trying to respond to everyones questions or comments for the past hour or so  i will continue working my way through for a bit more tonight  otherwise i will try to respond to the rest tomorrow  also dont be afraid to reach out and be friends with someone even if no one else will give someone a chance  every one deserves a chance at a friendship  be like my new friend   second update  i am a guy and i am happily married  after seeing some comments i thought id clear that up  i  just value having good friendships with other guys  sorry if i crushed anyones romance stories   third update  i do stand up for him as much as i can especially when its a direct conversation with me  i have a strong  i dont negotiate with terrorist  policy on this   fourth update  apparently running a mile under    minutes is something to be proud of  thank you all for the compliments  before i put on     lbs in fat i used to do it in under    i am out of touch with reality and i am sorry about that  you guys are all awesome btw   fifth update  i think i have responded to all the questions  i am overwhelmed by all your comments  encouragement  and advice you guys have given me  i was expected maybe   responses but am glad i was able encourage close to        people  also thanks for all these awards  i am not sure yet what all of them mean but will look further into them  have a great sunday   sixth update  apparently my supervisor is a reddit user and is now messaging me about it  i already put my two weeks notice in but hoping that it wont be a drama filled two weeks  wish me luck  if you are reading this sup please dont throw me under the bus  ,0
my funniest racism experience in china so i m a black guy who lived in china for a year   racism is quiet different in china and to be honest  it literally is  in your face    it could even get life threatening at times  i ve  had a lot of bad experiences but this one was one of the ones i actually liked and one i didn t mind   i was riding on the train in beijing  minding my own business and all of a sudden  someone shoves an earphone to my ears from behind  and i was surprised and pissed that this happened  and lots of rude people in china  so you re always on the edge  i turned around instantly and it s this teenage girl and she was hyper and very happy to see me it seemed   and then she says the most unexpected shit ever    she says             i like rap music   wow     i was so shocked but not angry  it was just too surprising and something i wasn t expecting after having earphones shoved on my ears    and i shit you not  the music was not even a black guy    it was fucking eminem    the whole thing brought a smile to my face because i knew it was just ignorance and not arrogance and you can t be mad at ignorance  she wanted to take selfies with me selfie with a black guy    i allowed it   we took selfies and we parted ways  ,0

the problem with immortality  so youve become immortal  perhaps it was an accident involving a few rubber bands  a liquid lunch  and a particle accelerator  it doesnt really matter  its done now  you now have to spend the rest of your life   ha   figuring out what to do with yourself   at first you do all the dangerous stuff  hang gliding  cave diving  crack cocaine  etc  you start stabbing yourself at the local bar as a trick to get free drinks  but youre running out of clean shirts that dont have knife holes in them   you briefly dabble with thoughts of becoming a superhero  but crime never seems to just happen in front of you  and going out and looking for it is just so much work you guys   you start investing for the long term  youre going to be around forever  what does    annual compound interest of    look like after      years   oh god  youre going to live forever  what does that even mean   youve got some time to kill  so start a hobby thatll take decades or centuries to finish  then start a new one  go to university to study physics and take a few hundred years to discover the quantum gravitational theory  aka the universal theory of everything  then master every musical instrument and write a symphony  or     then start doing crossword puzzles  you have time to do it all   dont develop close feelings for people  theyll all die  but youll endure  and funerals are depressing  and for you  unnecessary    you can have kids  lots of kids  but youll start losing track of them  they only really keep in touch for a few decades  and then theyll have kids and those kids will have kids and eventually youll lose track of it all  family doesnt have much meaning anymore once you have a billion or so family members but they all forgot that it was your birthday last tuesday   realize that youll outlive all of your enemies  you can afford to ignore them and just wait   why worry about anything  really  climate change might make things uncomfortably hot  but youll endure  the entire banking system may collapse trying to fund the interest on    deposited a thousand years ago  but eventually it will recover and youll be there when it does   if you want to  you can rule a country  after all  they cant kill the despotic dictator if the despotic dictator cant die  they can lock you up  but eventually all jails crumble  all regimes change   you realize that even your country will fail at some point  and then youll be right back where you started  bored on a sunday night wondering what to do with yourself and all this crack cocaine youve surrounded yourself with  and why you didnt remember until just now that it was your birthday last tuesday and how you didnt get even a single birthday card   so forget countries  start up your own religion with you as their god  call yourself the undying  religions last for a long time  the pope held massive power for over a thousand years  kings kneeling before him  you could do that   fund ai research  eventually you may want a friend that wont die  plus youll start forgetting things   where did i put the bank card to that account i started a thousand years ago    the ai can help you keep track of things   but keep the self destruct button close  no one will know you better than your ai companion  but one day youll have an argument and the ai will try to trap you for all eternity  or it will go mad and replicate itself infinitely to take over the earth universe  you will have to kill it  you will have to kill it and then rebuild it over and over and over again  remember always to build in a fatal flaw that you can exploit to bring it down  you are immortal  it is your only real competition over time  it is also your only real friend   they say that your chances of being trapped in a natural disaster are something like       but when your life is eternal  the chances of you being trapped in a disaster becomes      over time  it will happen at some point  you may spend a few thousand years trapped in the rubble of an earthquake toppled building that was built over by succeeding civilizations until eventually archaeologists or erosion or another earthquake frees you   at some point you will lose your sanity  its inevitable  try spending        years buried alive in the rubble of an ancient civilization and still keep your sanity  try to back up your memory  perhaps in that ai that you built    eventually  with certainly  you will be alone  in a billion years the sun heats up enough that surface water can no longer exist on earth  which pretty much means the end of all life   all life except you   in another     billion years the sun expands and swallows the earth  try not to be there when that happens  maybe you should use the donations from your religion or the interest on that    you invested a thousand years ago to fund space research  if only you could remember the bank account number you deposited the    into  or if only the bank still exists and didnt collapse after some ponzi scheme they fell for a few centuries ago   the earth may be gone now  but youre still going strong  the universe goes on and on  for ever and ever  possibly  eventually the stars start running out of hydrogen and helium to burn and one by one they all snuff out  the universe goes dark then  no more light  but youll endure  with no more stars  no more radioactive elements will be created  eventually  every element that can decay will decay down to base iron  with no more heat from stars or radioactive decay everything will cool down to near absolute zero  which is unimaginably cold  but youll still feel it  youll feel it forever   youll still be around  forever  in the dark  in the cold  forever  forever and ever   hopefully youll have

i just heard music for the first time in my life  which songs should i listen to  unfortunately  my parents took me on a ride on a jet plane when i was a few months old and i had been deaf since then    we live in a third world country and since my dad worked in the army  we couldnt afford a hearing aid  i didnt have any idea what  sound  was  today  i got a hearing aid as a present from an expat visitor and i could   hear   for the first time in my life   he played the song  we are the world  by michael jackson  it was overwhelming at first but i couldnt help but fall in love with the singers voice  his voice somehow comforted me  i experienced the peace i never knew existed   what other songs should i listen to   sorry  im all teary after hearing for the first time  i wish i could talk to you guys via voice chat to hear everyone although im sure i wouldnt be able to make out what youre saying  i think if people are talking about good things  they would give me that good feeling like the song  im not really sure of course  thanks again   edit  i will definitely listen to all the songs recommended by everyone whos awesome to have made a comment and keep each and everyone updated after ive listened to the recommended songs  wouldnt hurt to try and im willing to take whatever the risk haha  so far  i like the less repetitive ones like bohemian rhapsody  i find my eyes widen again and again while listening to bohemian rhapsody  i knew the lyrics and i thought it was supposed to be a sad song before i was able to hear but when i heard it  it gave more than just sad feelings  it made me feel like i was sort of floating in air  this is actually like a drug  i dont know why  most of the times i find myself frozen as i listen to the sounds   edit    dad and the kind gentleman who gave us the hearing aid showed me how to count the beats  they told me to hit the table along with them when the loudest shortest sound happened and showed me how to dance with the loudest sound  i had no idea dancing to the song would be this fast haha  now im dancing  i thought i was supposed to feel happy while dancing but i feel like im riding the waves in the ocean while dancing with the music  its more than the happy feeling  i feel sleepy and happy at the same time when the music is playing  is this how its supposed to feel when you hear the music while you dance   edit    holy shit holy shit  i just got back from dancing  im listening to all the songs one by one and it just continues to shake my heart  i watched the equilibrium movie and i always wanted to feel how it must have felt like when i saw christian bale in that scene where he heard the music  and i got gold from  u subliminal image and silver from an anonymous stranger even though i hadnt used reddit much  thank you thank you  i listened to canon in d as recommended by most redditors and my sister  the music without singers sounds totally different from the ones where the singers sing   edit    i understand the edits that thank the people who gave gold  silver etc might be frowned upon on reddit but i just wanted to thank  u dd     for giving me the pineapple award and the anonymous users who gave me gold and silver awards  i wonder what this award does   d if i could donate this award to somebody else id like to donate it   edit    i saw the comments which said they wished they could hear the songs they liked for the first time again  no idea why im tearing up reading them even after dancing happily with the songs  i am going to listen to all those songs and reply how i felt as i heard them for the first time  maybe this is the least i could do for the awesome comments    edit    my brother told me to listen to acapellas which was just the singer singing so that i could separately hear what people sounded like when they sang  its actually different from symphonies  its harder to process but it gives similar feelings  ,0

have been feeding crows for weeks  they ve started leaving me coins   surreal we have been feeding the crows in our area for weeks now  any scraps or leftover bits of food  they always come back around the same time each day and start making noise outside the window if we forget to feed them    last week we found a little pile of coins  mostly pennies  on our back porch near to where we would throw food out  we thought the neighborhood kids are mocking us for doing this    today we found another little pile and actually saw a little crow leave a penny on the pile   this is surreal  i have heard that birds such as crows leave gifts for humans because they re highly intelligent  but i never thought i d experience this firsthand  we now have    cents  thanks to our lovely crow friends                             edit  thank you for all the love on this post everyone  i didn t think my silly little quarantine story would gain so much attention  it s thoroughly made me day  ,0

my wife of    years just farted in front of me for the first time ever  its never happened before  shes huge on manners and would never discuss anything like farting or pooping  let alone do it in front of someone  i have heard her fart in her sleep before and she would get embarrassed if i mentioned it  so i usually shut up about it  i mean  its just farts  but weve been quarantined with our   kids for weeks now and its    its a lot  a few hours ago we were sitting on the couch  drinking our coffee and she just let it out  there was a moment of silence followed by a look of defeat in her eyes and a simple   sorry    im so happy  its just a fart  its weird but it was such a liberating  humorous moment for the two of us and it made my day  ,0
reddit can be toxic but its also literally a bunch of people who take time out of their day to help explain concepts  give advice  and share things to lol about with total strangers  i see subs like r estoration  r explainlikeimfive  r humansbeingbros and even just users who just go above and beyond in the comments to engage and do things like send food to strangers  explain jokes ideas really anything to people who are curious    ive made significant progress gardening thanks to people on r gardening  like  how fire is that  strangers educated me on how to restore my basil and plant a tree for the first time in my life    reddit is fucking amazing  thanks to lots of kind and thoughtful users  give yourself a pat on the back for fostering community online  i feel thats utilizing technology for the the highest good    also  place for animal gifs  ,0

so    ive been a redditor for    years now today   ive literally visited this site nearly every day for the past    years  also   i am a woman   i am black woman  i am a middle aged black woman    in all these years i can count on one hand the number of times ive revealed all three of these at once  revealing each one individually already has the propensity to bring the worst redditors to the table  i cant begin to tell you the names ive been called or the hurtful stereotypes i was expected to defend or debate because i revealed my gender  race or age over the past decade on reddit    but i never engage with those seeking to attack or debate due to the reveal  as wasting my time fighting a faceless battle on the internet with some jackwagon that feels powerful because they are able to hide behind their keyboard is pretty stupid to me   but dont get me wrong   the past decade on reddit hasnt been all bad  not way  i developed a phenomenal friendship offline with a redditor in my city after selling concert tickets to her    shes now one of my dearest friends     also  i live in this city without my family  several years ago i found myself in an abusive relationship during a pretty low  lonely and emotionally trying period of my life  i was an emotional zombie due to the sudden death of my mother and the professional struggles i encountered while trying to stabilize myself professionally and assimilate to a  less diverse  new city where i knew no one  after many doors being slammed in my face professionally  being alone  i gave up on myself and invited the wrong man into my life  putting myself in a worse situation    long story short   something in me finally clicked and i gained the strength to walk out   the previous week  id been in the hospital as id  fallen  down a flight of stairs   the firefighters that showed up knew something was wrong but i was afraid to tell them what was going on and what had happened  yeah  he pushed me    but on this night  i grabbed my little dog  my car keys and my wallet  got into my car and sped away  i had no plan  for some reason  that night i posted on reddit  scared  tired  confused  emotionally drained and broken  several redditors in my area came to my rescue  both men and women  offering me lodging for the night  to come and meet me for coffee  numbers to community resources and more  so much help  i rented a room at a motel     and met a redditor for coffee  she chatted with me until the sun came up and continued to check in on me the following day  i moved one week later into the very comfortable home of friend of hers that needed a roommate  i had no job at the time  i was on unemployment and had a severance from the company that had laid me off previously  that was quickly dwindling as id turned to alcohol after my mothers death     i found new employment soon after moving in with her and i know the patience  trust and the offer of a stable home and safe space i so desperately needed during that dark phase of my life was the springboard i needed to believe in myself again and get back to the life i deserved to live  the kindness will never ever be forgotten as long as i live as i shudder when i think of where i could have ended up as the depression  alcoholism and bad choices had me in their grasp      years later   my life is drastically different  i am back on the path of living the quality life i lived prior to moms death  i am stable  financially and mentally  ive a phenomenal career and want for absolutely nothing  but man oh man  that was a bad night  i was on a horrible path and those redditors were there for me  no judgement  just a desire to help in any way they could    so while reddit has changed a lot over the past decade  one thing that hasnt changed is that there are still redditors on this site that truly care about their fellow human beings that reddit alongside them  i guess thats why after a decade    this feisty middle aged chocolate girl  that doesnt look a day over      i promise   ha ha  is still happily redditing        its been an interesting    years    wonder what the next    will be like    thanks for reading my little ramble    aloha and thanks reddit     update   holy guacamole guys   thank you so much for all the love and the beautiful comments  and ive been gilded    i cant even right now  im so emotional right now yall    dammit reddit is the tits  yall are some cool people out there  keep on being awesome       and thank you for making my   th reddit bday so damned memorable   ,0
i had no covid symptoms at all  i wore a mask  and i washed my hands  within   hours of waking up today i was in the er isolate and social distance for god s sake  my family has been pestering me to travel out of state to visit for months  i said no each time because my state has been shit about containing the pandemic and i always say  act in such a way that if everyone did so  everything would work out     self quarantining sucks  i wanna go to the beach  i wanna see my family and friends  i wanna see a movie  i still said no  i still got sick  my mom is immunocompromised and i had no idea i was sick  had i visited last week i would be filled to the brim with guilt right now    i was completely asymptomatic when i woke up  then my chest felt tight  then i developed a cough  then my body started aching  my head is pounding  and my stomach is a war zone  all within around   hours  i m currently sitting in the er because i can t walk    feet without feeling winded    stay home  follow guidelines  keep everyone safe  and if we re lucky  we can make it through this  but it only takes one overestimate of your health to spiral out of control  please   edit   a lot of people have been asking for updates so i just wanna say thank you to everyone for their kind words of support and encouragement  i just got discharged after having the swab stuck up my nose and now i m home settling in for a long rest    i posted this basically in real time  and i want to make it clear  even if i don t test positive for this specific virus  i still contracted  something  despite following cdc guidelines as best i could  no parties  minimal shopping  etc  i m not even sure how i got whatever is making me miserable right now  what i m grateful for is that wearing a mask and keeping my hands clean definitely stopped the spread of whatever i have  covid    or not    i live in a state slammed by the pandemic  so the test will take     days to come back  i can t respond individually to everyone  but i wish you all the best and i hope you stay safe  ,0

i found a      bill at the bottom of a hotel pool        so  i took it to the managers office to hold on to it in case anyone came looking for it  they said no one has ever turned in cash before  everyone usually keeps it for themselves  so they took my number down and said if no one claimed it they would call me to come get it  i was super surprised by that because the thought of pocketing it never crossed my mind   how terrible that people take things that aren t theirs   i also thought that was incredibly nice of the staff because they also could have kept it if no one claimed it  i really wanted the person who lost it to find it  i know that feeling  and it sucks   but it also crossed my mind that it would be nice if no one claimed it because      would be ridiculously helpful for me right now    best part of the story  about   hours later i got a voicemail from the owner of the       the hotel must have given it to them  thanking me for turning it in and a story about their situation and how much of a difference finding the      bill made   honestly  that voicemail was worth way more than      to me  between the way the hotel staff handled the situation and the voicemail they left for me  it really restored a lot of faith in humanity  ,0

anyone else just hate how drinking alcohol is a norm  this probably has been said before but i feel like i need to reiterate it  the fact that alcohol is pushed into our faces by  making it a cultural norm to celebrate your first drink the day you turn legal age  having excessive amounts of pubs bars in the middle of town  advertising liquor on magazines  billboards  bathrooms  etc   people bragging about how much they can drink and or talk about how cool it is to be blackout drunk and getting wasted  it s truly disgusting and i m disappointed in society for it  i understand that alcohol can be controlled at a mature level but almost all adults cannot control their liquor which leads to alcoholism  family issues  damage to physical and mental health and so much more issues down the road  i m not going to be on my high horse because i have admittedly drank too much plenty of times and or purposely went over my limit due to my poor drinking choices and the alcohol increases more poor choices  anyways  i hate myself because it s been only giving me negative outcomes  never positive  i just wish alcohol wasn t a norm and it was more of a niche thing  as if it was something that people weren t talking about how drunk they got on the weekend or how stupid they acted on alcohol  ,0

i m really dumb but i think i m a nice girl so i feel like that makes up for it i ve always had my fair share of dumb things i ve said or asked but last weekend me and some friends played are you smarter than a fifth grader  during the game  i realized i really don t know basic knowledge  luckily my friends didn t make me feel bad about it and we all laughed it off  but i just couldn t stop thinking about it all week  especially since i only graduated high school two years ago    but tonight  as i lie fully awake at  am  i ve come to the conclusion that as long as im kind  that its okay if i m not the brightest  i pick up garbage i find outside  i put other peoples shopping carts away when they leave them around the parking lot  i go for a bike ride around my town everyday to check up and chat with a few seniors  i love to bake treats every week for my coworkers and my friends  and i love love love giving people compliments  i m a cashier so this is really easy when i get to talk to like     people a day   and i don t mean to try sit here and brag or try make it seem like i m better than anyone but i just really love knowing that sure  maybe i m not the smartest but at least my heart is in the right place     edit  would like to just add that it isn t just the trivia game  i didn t have the easiest time in high school  i was definitely more of a theatre and concert band type of gal  and i also dropped out of uni a year ago after failing every class so that brought me down a lot of pegs  and honestly just hearing  you re dumb but at least you re cute  too many times for my old roommate kinda messed with my brain a little hah  edit again  wow  thank you so much for my first awards  i just stumbled upon this subreddit a couple hours ago and didn t imagine getting this many responses  i m trying to read all of them and respond to most but i really do appreciate all of them    ,0
every single kid should have a world map on their room  i remember being a little kid and just spending hours looking at my map  letting my imagination run free  thats how i became interested in geography and learned a lot about the world    i dont know of many parents who put maps on their kids rooms  but i definitely think its an excellent idea to promote education in a fun way  ,0
remember when you used to be able to play youtube on your phone with the screen locked  e g  music   and then they took that feature away and tried to sell it back to us  feels bad man   i mean  i get it  they want a profit  but honestly with the way youtube premium is going  or rather not going   all they ve done is slash the utility of their app without getting that much in return   it s just disappointing is all   edit  perhaps i gave the wrong impression  no  i m not one of those chumps who actually pays for youtube  and i never will   edit  i am on ios  not android  as are a lot of the other people viewing this thread  we all definitely appreciate any solutions or ideas that you provide  but it would also be good to note whether the solutions you propose only work on one or the other   edit      other people have already suggested youtube vanced  pls no more  it is android only  btw   edit  i used music just as an example  yt isn t my primary source for music  i get my music from my streaming service of choice  as do most of y all i bet  but there are also plenty of other reasons why you wouldn t need the visual content of a video  podcasts  ted talks  whatever else   edit  been busy the last two days  haven t had time to read or reply to many comments  i m back to the party a bit late  but i ll be replying to some of y all soon  ,0

i might have accidentally done the best thing in my life  so  i live in china  before the covid thing  in january  my employer gave us a huge amount of groceries  like nuts  oil  rice  for spring festival   but i live in a tiny ass apartment without a kitchen  alone  so i really don t need that much food  and i genuinely cant eat all of them since i m also a tiny human being    before leaving work that day  i think long and hard about what i should do with all these food  there s no food banks where i live and i don t even have a car  most of my friends are already travelling back home  so i can t just split them with my friends   then  i realized that  there s a tiny noodle place close to where i work  they re obviously a family run business  i sometimes go there for dinner  not familiar with the owner  never even talked to that guy   but i thought  hey  they need oil and stuff more than i do   so  i just went to their place  they were just closing up  there s no customer  i grabbed the guy cleaning tables  asking if they want the groceries i m holding  he looked confused and suspicious of me  went in and got the owner to talk to me   the owner is actually a very nice older chubby dude  i asked him if he wants my stuff  he mistook my intention and asked how much i want for them  i blushed so hard and stuttered that they were all free  he just went  no no no  i can t do that  you must have some money    he s uyghur  so he s not very good at speaking mandarin    me with my red ass face insisted that he keep the groceries for free while he tries so hard to give me money  i said  happy new year  it s for you   and i basically ran out of there yelling happy new year   and the covid thing happened  i met the dude a few days ago after things eased a bit here in china  he was just closing up  again  and he gave me the biggest smile i ve ever seen   happiest day in three months  ,0

shoutout to everyone who doesnt actually have a solid best friend  because their best friends have better best friends or because they dont bond enough with people to have best friends or because their best friends constantly come and go and it just kinda leaves them felling vaguely isolated even though they might have plenty of regular friends                                                                            edit  if anyone wanna be my friend or has something to say feel free to dm  ,0

i m    and just had my best date since i was    years old we went to dinner and then made out in my car for an hour while listening to music like a couple of teenagers  we ve been courting via text for weeks and went on a hike  but tonight was our first kiss    since my kids  mom abandoned us in      i ve just settled for whatever came my way because i didn t think i should go after someone i actually wanted to be with  because it would just end up like it did with her  but a few months ago i decided to set and hold an unattainable standard and settle for nothing less  at least in terms of what attracted me to a woman and her personality  this woman fits it and i went for it despite my social ineptitude and complete lack of confidence  ,0

after two years living in  the bad neighborhood  ive overcome some prejudices i didnt know i had  my gf and i were both living off our savings while looking for a rental  which opened us up to living in areas we might not have otherwise considered  we found a massive  beautiful  recently remodeled townhouse well within our budget and half a mile from the office i had just gotten hired at    we had both mostly lived in middle class suburbs before  the week we moved in  there was a murder at the gas station located at the entrance of our neighborhood  this area was always  the bad part of town  in my mind and in the minds of my peers  when people asked where we lived  we named the interstate exit and never our street    the first week i lived there  i was considering putting bars on the lower level windows  i nearly jumped out of my skin one night when i heard footsteps in the woods behind the house  i was almost ready to run inside to grab a knife when a fat  trash eating possum waddled by   phew  i thought you might be a crackhead   ill never admit to thinking    after two years  ive come to realize that i dont live in a bad neighborhood  its just a not mostly white and low income neighborhood  i have neighbors of every color and we all wave at each other  talk  laugh  and get along    if i forget to take my trash out on trash day  my next door neighbor often does it for me  that shit never happened in the suburbs  theres a stray cat that has gained about   kitty pounds recently because me and both the houses next to me have been feeding the little shit  thats pretty cool and neighborly    last friday my gf and i were out back at  am  we heard a rustling in the woods  soon after a tall  shadowy figure of a black man appeared  no panic was felt  i have since learned that it could be a possum or it could be a homeless person  ive had many nights where a homeless person comes walking through the woods and we get to talking and hanging out  sometimes i share my booze with them  sometimes i share some food  and on a couple occasions i give them a blanket and let them sleep on my lawn chair  so when a shadowy figure of a black man appeared at  am  i didnt panic  instead i called out   hey  too tall  that you    it was him    so  the prejudice i have overcome isnt color based like you might have assumed  it was class based  i no longer immediately equate low income with dangerous and ignorant    this might be a little heavy for this sub  but i cant think of a better place to talk about this without it turning into a shit show  so  please  share your thoughts  i just renewed my lease another two years   ,0

just realized how many obese people are living in the u s  so i recently went on a long trip to europe and just came back home a few days ago  the other day i was in a large gas station convenience store and it just hit me  the employees making my sandwich were overweight  the cashier was overweight  and many other customers were also very overweight  as i am writing this right now in a cafe  i am observing the same as well  while i was in europe i barely saw people like this and if i did they were tourists  now that i am back home it s like i cannot unsee it    i don t mean to judge anyone  obviously many people have medical related issues  i think it s just interesting to see the major difference in eating habits and lifestyles between europe and the u s  is it the quality of food  general lifestyle differences  anyone else notice the same  ,0
today i found out my house spider tom cheated on me  so several time ago i found a spider  which was actually a daddy long legs  hanging under the handrail in my room  i usually hate spiders  but instead of giving in to my hatred or saving him  i thought it would be pretty cool to have a spiderbro hangin around in my apartment  thus  i decided to keep him and name him tom   this is where the drama started  he was shy at first  and his webskills were  not the best   which is a blatant euphemism   also  i dont think he was the smartest of his kind  since he was hangin in a place that probably wouldnt catch a lot  as i already connected with him on a super deep level and wanted to show him how much i care  i threw some moths  which i hate passionately  into his lousy excuse of a web  after some time  he turned to my gifts  and i was content that i could contribute to his happiness with my love   the next morning i found the moths on the floor  confused and ignoring the obvious red flag  i threw them into his web again  in addition to that and some point later  i killed a wasp without squishing it too much  and it took me several attempts to make it stick in those few threads he could manage to tangle up  as i said  his webskills sucked  again he turned to it at some point and i found joy seeing how he sucked the life out of that dude   however  the next morning  the wasp was lying on the floor  this is where i should have drawn the line  the second red flag  instead  i took some attempts to give it back  which was not easy  since tom is a complete imbecile  i tended to my business as usual afterwards and carefully touched the wasp from time to time to let him know that he can eat again   the next morning he was gone  just gone  nothing  not even weaving me goodbye  i was pretty sad but thought he probably needed something else in his life  so i moved on  as hard as it was   today i chilled on my balcony  reminiscing about my life choices  and guess who i found  just on the other side of the window  yes  a daddy long legs  hangin around innocently in the corner of the other side of the handrail  just outside   i feel betrayed  heartbroken  there he was  i knew it could only be him  since his web has caught less than the amount of fucks everybody gave about him before i took him in  i guess he needed to move on   fuck you tom  i hope all you catch is low protein   ps  i rested my head next to him while sitting outside to show him i still exist in the whole magnificence of my passive aggression  but he just ignored me  fuck you  tom    nbsp   edit  silver  i will vigorously flaunt these newfound riches to let tom know that he could have been part of great wealth  thank you kind stranger    nbsp   edit    thats my first gold  good gracious  thank you  i think tom starts to realize what hes missing out on  cause i just checked on him and he was all upside down    nbsp   update  after waking up today  i felt strangely free  your support really helped me in these dark times  and i think ive reached the point where i can say  im over you  tom  when i checked on him this morning  i felt like a survivor   also  yesterday i saw a silverfish  he was even more shy than tom and almost instantly tried to hide  which was kind of cute  who knows what happens  keeping it casual this time  ,0

i know fergie probably isnt a redditor  but just in case she sees this  yes  her rendition of the national anthem was    not great  but i feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people  too  and theyre being really harsh    there was a reddit confession from am anonymous a lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed  the post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was   many people seem to think it was kim kardashian     that post really hit me  because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadnt committed suicide was because of her family and kids    so  not knowing where else to post this  i just wanted to say that while fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem  shes still a human being with real emotions  people need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential   just because someone is famous  or just because youve never met them  doesnt make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them  its still bullying   i guess im just venting because people  reeaally  like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and im sick of it  that is all       edit    hello  all  this definitely got more of a response than i was expecting  and while id love to respond to everyone  i have some things to do  so in a mass response to everyone     thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post  whether for or against this opinion  im happy this started a good discussion     i understand that its fergies job to sing and whatnot  but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage   unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something  by all means  rip away at em   as with everything in life  there is definitely a gray area  and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion   i just dont want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary  there is already enough of that     obligatory  thanks for the gold  kind stranger    okay  thats all ive got for now  have a nice day  everybody      edit      okay  i know i have stuff to do  but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of   well  she gets paid a lot of money  so it doesnt really matter    well  heres my reply i made to one of those commenters    well  i can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives     however  theres a reason the phrase  money cant buy happiness  exists    money solves the physical problems   better healthcare  better food  better clothes  better cars  and so on    still  while the  landscape  is different  the base problems are still the same   fear of death  humiliation  depression  jealousy  frustration  et cetera    thats what makes us human   those feelings  those fears  those desires    all im saying is  lets not forget that people like her are people  too  the entertainment industry  while financially lucrative  is extremely emotionally taxing   ,0
i adopted a teenage boy update  hello  my name is jack  im sorry i havent updated in   months  i am a    year old man who was never able to conceive with my wife  we really wanted to adopt but were unable to due to financial issues until recently      as you may know  we adopted a    year old boy named jonathan   https   www reddit com r casualconversation comments   x rq i adopted a teenage boy   he has been dealing with depression  anxiety  anger issues  ptsd  and an eating disorder     so whats changed since two months ago when we had recently adopted him     for starters  jonathan was kicked out of yet another school quickly for fighting  the school he had been in before we adopted him but only for like a couple months  so we decided to put jonathan in a special school for troubled youth     although its a very slow process and he still skips class and gets in fights this school is definitely doing some good  they focus on how to fit into the world  mental health  anger management  all stuff relevant to jonathans life    jonathan still smokes  i found text messages on his phone between him and another boy about a drug transaction  the drug in question was oxycodone  i asked him  in a pub casually so that he felt relaxed and not pressured  why he wanted this drug  opiates  while providing pain relief  can be very addictive and dangerous     he basically told me that his pain and trauma are bigger than anything pot and cigarettes could help with  i told him its a very bad idea to buy opiates off the street and if he is looking for help all he needs to do is ask and we will try to help best we can  so  i scheduled an appointment with the doctor  he agreed not to go through with the transaction so i told him i was proud of him and i swear he smiled a little bit    as you may of remembered  jonathan since meeting him has been extremely aggressive  i was prepared to take this on since the moment i met him as i am much taller and bigger than him  i was  however  a bit afraid for my wife  well  jonathan has thrown things at me and attempted to hit me and such many  many times since i met him but he has never tried to hurt my wife at all and for that i see he is a good boy and he can live a normal  happy life eventually if he can get passed all the trauma in his life    well i signed him up for boxing early on and gave him a punching bag and that helped at the beginning  although he was still very aggressive  lots of these issues that come with adopted children take nothing but time and care and support to resolve and two months later jonathan  while still aggressive  is getting better every day      in the two months since i originally posted  he has stopped freaking out every day  he still gets mad everyday but not freak out throw things scream mad  just mad  the freakouts id say come about once a week now which is a huge improvement     we still go to the pub once a week which he has always really enjoyed  i think one of the things with jonathan is he likes to be treated as an equal     jonathan speaks more than he used to  this is a great achievement because in my orignal post he just got angry or was silent but in these past two months he has started to speak more  sometimes just random things like have you read this article in the newspaper     its a slow process but its really awesome seeing jonathan progress further and further as time goes on  i believe he can get through this all and move towards a bright future     edit  i forgot to mention the eating  yeah  it is still as much of a challenge to get jonathan to eat as it was   months ago when i made the original post unfortunately   ,0
i learned about  tl dr  from reddit and used it in a really long work email  now everyone in the company is doing it too  a couple weeks ago  i had to send a super long email to our president explaining a situation that happened at work  it was super thorough and had lots of attachments and numbers and other boring stuff  hes a super busy dude and assuming he wanted to know what happened and involve who he need to who would review the finer points  so i added a  tl dr  and put the quick  two sentence synopsis at the end   a couple hours go by and he calls me and ask what the heck  tillder  means  i explained that because the email was so long  i added the short  too long  didnt read  for him so hed get the picture without having to read the entire narrative  he thought it was awesome and ended up forwarding the email to the entire company explaining  tillder  and now everyone is using it   tl dr  i sent the company president an email with  tl dr  in it and he thought it was cool and now everyone else uses it  ,0
today i fell apart and sobbed in the street  and a homeless man comforted me  lots of other people passed me as i cried whilst stress smoking a cigarette  most went silent as they passed me  but a homeless man and his adorable dog came over to me to check i was okay  and i got to pet his dog  he showed me kindness today  and although he could do nothing to alliviate my terrible day  he delivered more compassion than anyone else who saw mr  hes lifted my day simply by being kind and cant even thank him properly  so im telling reddit  maybe we can all pay that kindness forward and help someone like me that you happen upon   edit  thanks for reading this everyone  im sorry i cant keep up with all the comments  but it brightened my day to read all the stories  for those of you that have also broken down in the street  remember that struggling alone is no way to live  reach out for help  and be kind to yourself  we cant fix people we see on distress but we can show compassion  sometimes thats all thats needed  ,0

best hug ive had in years  i had a wonderful experience today  an uber driver picked me up and took me from my hotel down to a store where i wanted to pick up a few beers and something to eat in my hotel that doesnt come from room service or the bar  it was just before   am  im a regular visitor to the country from a timezone where   am here is   pm for me at home   in casual conversation i asked him if he had just started work for today  he replied that hed been up all night and had to work until hed made another      his rent is due today   anyway  he waited whilst i bought my beer and food  i paid the cashier and on the way out noticed a cash machine at the door  one of those that you have to draw cash in     bills  i dont know what i was thinking but     isnt that much money that you cant help a fellow human being out  i drew       when he dropped me off i asked him if i could tip him in cash rather than on the uber app and of course he was okay with that  when he saw the money he started crying  it was a     ride  he got out of the car with me and gave me a hug  he wouldnt let me go for the longest and most beautiful hug ive had in years   i said   go get some sleep bro     sleep tight alvin  ,0
i just binge watched all   seasons of  the good place  and i dont think ive ever been so emotional  im a    year old man and by the last episode i was bawling   the last episode just had me thinking about wife and i and i couldnt keep it together   i have never reacted this way to any movie or tv show   it left my wife pretty perplexed     she didnt watch the show with me and had no idea the message that was conveyed etc   by the time i finished the last episode she basically had to put me to bed like an over emotional toddler   now im sitting here trying to organize my thoughts about the whole experience and i actually feel pretty good  better than ive felt in a long time   i just wanted to share  thanks for listening  ,0
i saved a woman s life today this had just happened to me a hour ago   i had just gotten off work at   from my job at a convenient store  it is located right next to a red light and as i walked to my car someone got t boned and a lady got thrown from her car   i froze for a second and just stared at her and then ran over to her  she wasn t breathing and she had no pulse  her face was bloody and messed up  someone then ran over to me and asked if i knew cpr and i couldn t speak i just nodded and started giving this woman cpr  someone had called     but i was giving her cpr for what felt forever  but she had them opened her eyes and gasped  she looked at me with this stare of fear then closed her eyes again and told her to keep her eyes open but she kept them closed  she was breathing so i knew she was ok but i was scared for her  it wasn t until now that i realized there was people standing around me all looking at me  it didn t feel real    it wasn t until a few minutes later the ambulance got there  before they took off someone asked me for my number  i think it was there husband  the police also took my phone number had asked me what happened and i told them   i don t know what will happen next am just hoping she will be ok   update  i got a call around   today informing me that the lady had passed away shortly after getting to the hospital  it s sad but i was told she had internal bleeding   it s made me wonder  some of you have mentioned that it doesn t make sense that she revived  it makes me wonder if she even did  maybe it was just twitching that i thought was a gasp i really don t know but would be interested in hearing from any doctors about that possibility  something i do know is her eyes opened and i swear to you she looked at me before they closed again  someone had told me i don t know if it s mentioned in the comments but in a traumatic situation the brain can tell you something happened that didn t  i really don t know to be honest with you   on a less sad note i would please like to encourage everyone to learn cpr you don t need to be certified just know what your doing  getting certified could help a lot however even if you just get level a    some people had asked me about my training so i thought i would mention it here even though i mentioned it in comments   i am level c certified from the canadian red cross  i was taught in grade   gym and grade    outdoor ed where it was mandatory to learn   i would also like to mention i am still working on getting tested  the line is ridiculous long so i have to wait awhile   just adding in here since someone said about it  it was not the hospital that called me it was the husband   also thank you everyone for all the up votes and rewards i am truly thankful for it all  ,0

i threw out    bags of trash yesterday ive been living by myself for over   years now  and my life kind of fell apart without me noticing  every once in a while i start cleaning up some of the clutter thinking  today is the day im going to start fixing myself   but theres just so much to do that i give up  and it doesnt take long before any improvement i made gets replaced with even more trash than before   so after several years of that  my house had fallen into what might be described as a pathetic state  but last week i finished up a project at work and for the first time in a long while i didnt have anything in the near future to stress over  so i took friday and saturday to gather up everything for once and throw it all out  as it turned out  there was a lot of it  i threw out more stuff from my house by volume than i kept in   the place is still an embarrassment  because underneath all the garbage was a layer of dust and dirt and stains i still have to deal with  but its probably the first time since i moved in that i dont need to tiptoe around to avoid stepping on trash   anyway  i just thought it was a pretty remarkable amount of bags  ,0

a moment of silence on a busy subway for people who lost their lives because of covid    this happened literally    minutes ago  i was just heading home  the subway is pretty packed  cos i live in shanghai and there s not a quarantine anymore   and suddenly the subway stopped moving   the driver announced that there will be a moment of silence for everyone who lost their lives because of covid    in a few minutes   i wasn t sure if everyone is going to do it  because nobody seems to react to that piece of news  they re all looking at their phones and stuff   and when the time came  everyone stopped what they re doing and stood up  i mean everyone  the guy sitting across me took off his headphones  an old dude took off his hat   all the subway trains honked at the same time  the girl next to me started sobbing   i still can t believe every single one of these ppl actually all stopped what they re doing in honour of victims around the world  we are all in this together  and we can do it  ,0

i won   figures in the lottery   not the powerball  its low   figures but still life changing       a few months ago i was at a gas station to fill up my car and bought a few groceries in their shop  i remember the total was just under     so i thought id take a single quick pick to avoid getting back the small change      fast forward to this week  im about to sell my car and  get my belongings out of it  i check the sun visor and see the lotto ticket i had already forgotten about tucked in behind some other receipts      checked the ticket online  entered the number and there it was  all numbers correct   this happened on tuesday evening  i called the lottery on wednesday   the wait for their hotline to open in the morning was the longest time ever   to confirm that my ticket was indeed the winner  havent left the house in three days and barely slept   i look like a drug addict now lol      today they sent over a representative to collect the ticket  now its confirmed  even if the rep loses it  they still have to pay out      i have no real friends so the only people i told is my immediate family  both my mom and my dad had a less than stellar upbringing and parenting and we have no contact with our shitty extended family for a variety of reasons       they always stuck by my side and supported me even when i fucked up and disappointed them  they were are the best parents i could imagine and now its finally time to give back         i opted for a self imposed cooldown period for a couple of weeks until the winnings are paid so as to figure out what do do exactly and how to proceed     i dont plan on telling anyone else besides my parents and my sibling            edit        wow thanks for the platinum  gold   silver guys i have to admit im honestly floored right now  i cant stop smiling  not because of the win but because of all the positivity  the nice replies and the encouragements     i initially didnt want to post on reddit because i felt it was braggy and in your face     i genuinely just wanted to share this because   as i said   i dont really have anyone to talk about this besides my immediate family     anyways  im glad i did and thanks for all the heartfelt messages   this community is really awesome  d            edit           after this took off i want to add some clarifications because it has been brought up numerous times      ill collect the winnings anonymously  im already aware of the tax cut and i will get fiduciary advisors     i have set up a couple of meetings with different banks and law investment firms that specialize in wealth management  generational wealth  setting up trusts and all that  all of them work independently from each other and thus have no conflict of interest            ,0

i just learned what  see you   not if i see you first  means i feel stupid  i always thought it was just kind of a joke  but i was watching downton abbey and it was used in what i now realize is the actual meaning  if a says  see you  and b says  not if i see you first   b is implying that upon seeing a  b will get the hell out of there so they wont have to interact   is this common knowledge that i was just a total idiot in missing   edit  okay good  i definitely wasnt the only person who didnt realize this ,0
i took my first full breath today      f  nz   ive known for over a decade that im anemic  it didnt feel like a big deal because it never prevented me from doing the things i wanted to do    i took iron and vitiam c supplements for a while but they made me feel sick so decided not to bother   yeah  i require more sleep then most people but i exercise often  eat reasonably well  and consider myself healthy   recently  i had laproscopic surgery and the doctor  after seeing my blood results  scheduled me in for a fully funded iron transfusion   iron deficiency occurs when the body doesn t have enough of the mineral iron  this leads to abnormally low levels of red blood cells  that s because iron is needed to make hemoglobin  a protein in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen around the body   the transfusion experience took about   hours and the iron felt cold when it entered my vein  i didnt feel anything at first but then later on that day  i almost choked on oxygen  it was like a double breath  a breath straight after another breath and it was completely involuntarily    it confused me at first but then i quickly realised i could suddenly breathe twice as deep as i could before   without even trying  when i try take a big breath now  it feels like i can inhale more oxygen than my ribcage can hold   its crazy that i never knew  i was living with shortness of breath for so many years  so to celebrate  i sat outside in the cold winter air  just enjoying breathing at full capacity     what a beautiful gift i was given  ,0
good news  im going to teach you how to time travel  are you ready  alright  this is what i want you to do   in present day  pick a spot that is special to you  your favorite seat in the livingroom  a bench at a park  etc  that you want to use as an anchor  invest in a good     vr camera  i want you to take that camera and put it in your anchor spot  record in that spot for     hours  nothing has to happen  just record  then in    years when you start to forget what your first apartment looked like  you could pick up a flash drive  pop on a vr headset  and go back     thats just the tipping point  if you want to put more effort into it  you can walk in and talk to future you  have a conversation  obviously pretty one sided   or set the camera up  turn on netflix  and marathon your favorite show with younger you  how cool would that be   if you want to get advanced you can bring people in on it  whenever you set up your camera  tell everyone that it is you from the future  what is time travel really  if you believe that time is linear and that the past cant be changed  then you are in fact time traveling  especially if people are interacting with you  you just have a weird robot camera body and cant speak    take it a step further for your kids  when you have a teenager who knows everything and thinks you are too old to get it  give them a vr headset and let them hang out with younger you for a little bit  younger you  present you  can give them advice that they might take more to heart    how enjoyable of an experience depends on how much effort you put into it  and there you go  you just learned how to time travel  ,0

if you are kind to others  thank you    months ago i went through a horrible breakup  as i was walking into the apothecary in the mall  the employee saw me crying my eyes out  and she proceeded to give me a beautiful crystal stone    yesterday the person in front of me paid for my starbucks food    and today an employee gave me free fries because he felt bad that i had to wait a couple extra minutes   these seemingly little acts of kindness give me so much motivation and i inch towards philanthropy every time they happen  even intangible acts like a smile or sharing a laugh brightens my day so much   if you are kind to others  thank you  it can mean the world to another ,0

i just found my dads rate my professor page and it makes me so happy  my dad is a great guy  he s had a bit of a rough go in the last few years with some unfortunate events in his life  but that s never changed how wonderful he is  i don t really get to know what happens between him and his students at work  and he s a researcher and professor for a university in my state  so that side of him has always been a bit unknown to me  i discovered rate my professor recently when starting to sign up for college courses  and randomly decided to look him up   his students love him  he has a perfect score with     reviews  and the reviews are nothing but praise  i ve read all of them  and it makes me so happy to see that people enjoy my dad as much as i do   honestly  i just wanted to tell someone about it  i haven t felt this amount of genuine happiness in a long time  and this was the only place i could think of   edit  it was late last night when i posted  but i finally had a chance to talk to my dad about what i saw  i asked him if he had any idea what his students thought about him on rate my professor  and he told me that he d always been too afraid to look  which to me  btw  is hilarious  because i felt a little nervous when looking at them too  i guess we re the same in that regards   i told him about his reviews  and about how much people liked him  and he seem surprised  he mentioned that he thought people only left a review on that site once they had a bad experience  not to just compliment a professor they like  and when i told him he had a perfect score  he started laughing   he told me   i m really glad people enjoy my class  it s something i m incredibly glad i got to start doing when we moved here  and it s something that brings me a lot of joy   we moved about the same time my dad started teaching on campus  which would be about four years ago  so he is still somewhat fresh into the system   i told him about how happy and proud it made me to see so many people say so many good things about him and he smiled  and responded with  i ve heard there s another website that ranks professors attractiveness  i wonder what score i have on there    classy   anyways  thank you to the people that recommended me talk to my dad  and thanks to the people that could share in a happy moment of mine  ,0
my dad drove four hours from nyc to boston to deliver me soup because i had a bad day i found out that my job s contract will likely not be renewed for next year on friday  it was a wild year with a crazy admin who makes a lot of cuts so while it wasn t the biggest surprise  it was still upsetting  ended up crying to both parents on the phone  mostly my mom  towards the end i said something like  ugh  i really want panera soup  but they don t deliver and i cannot fathom driving    minutes there and back right now    it was a long day for multiple reasons  and i love panera s creamy tomato soup as comfort food that fits my gluten free needs   i ordered other food that night and thought i d treat myself to soup another day   saturday at around   pm i get a call   hey  it s dad  i know i should have called to make sure it was okay  but i m here  outside of your apartment building  i picked up some panera but i m happy to drop it off and leave  i just know you wanted soup    i obviously welcomed him upstairs and he stayed the night  turns out his plan was to drop it off with my doorman  and text me saying he ordered it from panera and paid an extra     for them to make the delivery  so i would have never known he made the drive   his plan was literally to drive a combined    hours from nyc to boston and back just to drop off soup and a salad  because his daughter had a bad day   my dad rocks   edit  thanks for all the love  kind comments  and anecdotes  totally didn t expect this to blow up  made my night to read all of these messages  i teared up at some of your stories  much love to you all   edit    turns out i wasn t non renewed  but i am hoping to leave the job now anyway as i had already started seeking new opportunities  hope to move closer to my family and can do so on my own terms  onward and upward  ,0

today on the bus there was a transgender woman and a lady literally moved seats to not have to sit next to her  so i moved seats to sit next to her  she realized that woman moved seats to avoid her and i could tell she was hurt  i try to avoid people mostly and don t talk to anyone much but she was sweet and it blew my mind the close mindedness that still exists and the rude af behavior of people  just be nice damnit we are all human regardless of what we look like or how we identify   update  i just saw her again at the bus plaza and she gave me hugs and was talking about her day   she was in a great mood  happy she just got some cute shoes at goodwill  sparkly little sandals ,0
i secretly paid for a dine and dasher  but got revealed instantly i was eating lunch at a local small restaurant  there is usually only one waiter who im pretty sure is the son of the owner   this guy at the table across from me was eating in workout clothes and didnt look like he had a wallet  after eating he got up and left without looking at the check  it sat there for a long time  when the waiter walked by  he just shook his head sadly when he saw the guy was gone   i waited until the waiter was in the back  then slipped some cash into the check folder and went back to my table    the waiter came back and looked at the check in confusion  then he went to the window to see if the guy was walking away after coming back  he went to the bathroom to see if he was in there  i was smiling at this point because i thought it would be a mystery to the waiter forever  then he went over to the register and pulled up the security camera  busted   edit  i went back and  took a picture  https   imgur com  wzp  o  ,0
today  a man was drinking and blaring his vulgar music on a portable speaker in a packed train and i worked up the courage to ask him to stop that which sounds like nothing  but if youve ever been on public transport  youll know that everyone just tries to avoid causing trouble for themselves by awkwardly begrudgingly putting up with disruptions   however  this was wayyy too loud and too vulgar to ignore  was some super trashy and crude rap music   i decided to stop introverting and plucked up the courage to ask him politely to turn his music down   he swore at me and walked off at the next stop and i thanked him for that  to which he threatened me to watch my back   i dont care about empty threats and am just proud i did something like that and just wanted to share somewhere  thanks for reading   edit  this  uh  blew up         thank you for the gold kind strangers  ,0

against my best efforts  slid right through a stop sign   luckily this place is deserted and i knew to tap my breaks so i didnt get close to hitting anything  but i damaged my pride   i can now admit that i might be in over my head   its been    minutes  and were at   a couple inches   https   i imgur com hzzkhbi jpg   ill be lucky to get out of here tuesday  but on the plus side  this is a

why dont all showers have at least   shower heads for the front and back  so you can feel the warmth of the water at all times all over your body without having to spin like a rotisserie chicken  do these actually exist somewhere  they must   right   it couldnt be that difficult to run some extra piping to account for at least a second shower head   i cant be the only one who spins in the shower to feel the warmth   edit  first platinum award  didnt think this would blow up  but really glad im not alone   when i posted this i didnt consider the conservation aspect  id be willing to totally take shorter showers to make up for the steady stream of warmth all over   edit   i did try posting this in r showerthoughts first  but their rule    prohibits posts about literal showers  stupid  but it worked out  because i found this sub instead  ,0
why is everyone on reddit so rude  i know its not literally everyone on reddit but almost every community i go to is full of either rude  harsh  condescending  overly sarcastic sardonic  exceedingly crass etc comments even about the most innocuous of topics  i dont get it  and i dont think its just internet anonymity  because having been to many other forums for many various things on the internet   granted not as large as reddit  and none have this problem  people on other forums still speak as kindly and civilly as they would irl  and theyre just as anonymous  its something different with reddit   it just feels refreshing to see people engaging kindly with each other here  ,0

my mom never made me feel guilty about wasting food and im a better person for it  my mom never made me feel bad for not liking an ingredient or not finishing my plate  she always told me to listen to my body so its okay if im full before the end of the meal  whenever i show shame for wasting food she always says  its okay  the dogs will love the treat   and that mindset has made me a better adult  if i lose money or clothes or whatever i always think  whoever found that mustve really needed it      which is a mindset i think parents try to teach with the whole  there are children starving in africa  argument but it does the opposite  it makes kids obsessive over not wasting anything which can lead to some serious depression when we live in a world where   waste is absolutely impossible     thank you  mom  for teaching me the value of things  even if it wasnt in a traditional way     edit  i wish i could reply to all your comments but this has been so overwhelming and i am so thankful for all of your replies  you guys are the best   thank you  reddit  for being such an amazing and loving community  ,0

my mom is currently going off on my dad in spanish  he bought and smoked is smoking     slabs of ribs and a new smoker  it s hilarious  my dad always goes way overboard with shit like this  we re supposed to invite a few neighbors and friends over to eat bbq tonight  this would be like    people including kids and babies at most  dad apparently spent       on the extra smoker  pans  seasonings  and the ribs themselves    he s like a puppy who peed on the carpet because he knows this was stupid but he s in too deep now and has to finish cooking the ribs  it s hilarious because he has this embarrassed little smile on his face and my mother is storming through the house going off on him in spanish     there s so many ribs i can t stop laughing  now he keeps saying he ll load up the truck and give them to hungry homeless people but my mom knows he s trying to get in her good graces so she said   that wasn t your original plan   and stormed off again     my dad has a history of doing this  he got into woodworking a few years ago and currently has like    or so projects at various stages of completion   i went out to his shop one day a few months back and he was surrounded by sawdust and wood and half done projects  at first it was just quiet because i was surprised at the mess and then he said   i may have gone overboard with woodworking    i love my dad he s so lovably oafish with certain things       edit  if anyone is somewhat near kc  mo and is seriously wanting some ribs  message me  seriously  we need to get rid of this stuff because we d need another freezer to store it all lol  this message is approved by my father    ,0
my boyfriend and i have found a little bedtime ritual that makes me feel so loved im usually the last one to get into bed at night  thanks  excessive skincare routine   even though we live in a warm climate  my feet are always really cold when i slide under the covers  and on my own would take forever to warm up enough for me to fall asleep   but now  every time i come to bed  rather than scoot away from them  my boyfriend raises his knees  and lowers his legs onto my feet so they get toasty warm so much faster  he started doing this unconsciously  i guess after he noticed that i try to move my feet close to him at night because his side of the bed is so warm  just that little gesture makes me feel so cared for  i know having ice cold feet in your warm bed cocoon isnt comfortable   as for me  i have pretty long  natural nails  so when he turns over to fall asleep  i give his whole back a good scratch  it seems silly  but i try to get all the spots that he cant reach himself  and it really seems to relax him  just my way of saying one more  i love you  before sleep  i guess   edit  what are some little rituals you have with people you care for  i love hearing about those details that make relationships unique ,0
i hugged the pizza delivery guy  because he needed it  so  i ordered a pizza for my wife and myself   pretty standard fare   delivery guy shows up  its the wrong order   pizza guy was a kid  maybe    years old  more likely    or       he apologized and left with a glum look on his face   about twenty minutes later he showed back up with my order and he just looked defeated   initially i had planned to give him a    and let him keep the change for the tip  but they discounted the order and it was just shy of    bucks   there was a ten spot sitting on the hutch by the front door so i just handed him that and asked him to hang on a second because i knew i have fives in my wallet in the other room   but i guess he just assumed he wasnt getting a tip when i walked away from the door with the pizza   the kid walked back to his car while i wasnt looking  i guess he figured he was out of a tip   i go back to the door and see the kid getting into his car on the street   so i walk up the drive to the street and wave him back    hey  youre tryin to leave without your tip   i yelled to him  but he couldnt really hear me from inside the car so he got out and met me at the top of the drive   he asks   oh  was something else the matter    instead of answering his question i asked him   whats got you so glum  son    keep in mind  im a big guy  with a beard  and a belly and i wear bermuda shorts in the middle of texas   think urban grizzly adams but a little angrier looking   the kid was obviously surprised by my question   but he answered honestly and told me   im from  a small town  east of  this major city  and its my first month here and its been a rough couple of weeks    so  i asked him to go on   he went on to tell me he missed his parents and his friends  but he was dedicated to his schooling and that it was necessary for him at the time being   and i said to him   thats it   and just kinda left the question floating between us and thats when he says to me   well  my boyfriend also broke with me and its been really tough    then he had this look of mortification on his face when he  i guess  realized he just outed himself to a stranger that he didnt know from adam   i looked at him and said   oh  man  thats rough   well  here  you were trying to leave without your tip    as i was handing him the cash  i said   cmere man    and opened my arms up for a hug   this kid just threw his face into my chest and hugged me back so hard that i knew in that moment it was the right thing to do   when the hug ended  not too long  not too short  i held onto his shoulders  looked him in the eyes and told him   its going to be okay   youre young  and feelings can be overwhelming  but keep your chin up and your nose in the books   ten years from now youll have forgotten about what his face and youll be happier and more successful than you can imagine now  especially if you continue to be the honest person i think you are    or something like that   all he said was   wow  thank you    and i turned around and walked back down to my driveway    today i found this on my door   https   imgur com c j a   i guess it meant more to him than i realized     x   b     x   b   has anyone else had any encounters like this   id love to hear about it     x   b   edit  holy smokes  this thread blew up while i was sleeping   i cant respond to everyone  but i am reading all the comments   im glad my story touched so many of you   full disclosure  im by no means a perfect example of kindness  but i do my best   my life has been plagued with violence and tragedy  but its also had its moments of pure love and joy   its those moments i live for   i have learned  finally  to focus on the things in my life that helped me grow to be a better human being  it took me a long time  id like to think thats why this story happened  because i somehow grew into the man i hoped i would one day be   i am real   my life has been too real   and this story is really real   my wife and i were laughing about it last night before bed  i told her someone said i was trolling and she made some puns that were just    awful   but i love her still   thank you all for your kind words and shared stories   they all mean a lot to me  really  ,0
i just permanently deleted my facebook and it was far more liberating that it should have been    i m not much of a poster on facebook  but i find myself getting in imaginary arguments with some of the morons from my home town with their bigoted views regularly  i found the power it had to put me in a bad mood unnerving to say the least   to add to that  my lack of posting on recent events upset someone i know well that is a hard left vocal poster  he told me that my lack of voice on social media made me a hypocrite and part of the problem  i have been giving     of my wage and     of my bonus to relevant organisations for over   years now  ever since my black friend charles  was racially abused at his place of work  i m not saint  and sure  there probably is more all of us can be doing  but like f ck am i going to let someone judge me for not sharing posts online   anyway  that was my final straw  i m going to continue doing my part financially  and continue doing so with pride  but i m no longer letting myself get sucked into the vortex of facebook and their bad ethics and grossly addictive platform   and yes  i know  i should delete other apps created by them  but i m not going to  facebook is the mental mind fuck that has been most damaging  and with no remorse and a genuine sigh of relief i m glad to say bye to it   edit  everyone here is very kind  understanding  and thoughtful  interesting to see such a huge acknowledgment of how toxic facebook is  if you re tempted  try temp deleting and getting rid of the app  it helps  have a great weekend everyone ,0

i gave a guy cpr today a man collapsed on the train i was travelling to school on this morning  when it happened he was about   ft away from me  he just slumped onto the floor  and everyone else on the train just stood and looked but took no action  i remembered what id read about the bystander effect on reddit and decided i needed to be the person to act  so i told a woman to call an ambulance and went over to the man on the floor   he was wearing     coats  so i am assuming he was homeless  so i ripped them off and tried to find a pulse  after about    seconds another woman came over who said she was a nurse and she began talking to the paramedic on the phone while i tried to get a pulse  couldnt find one so i began chest compressions and not long after the man started to groan and it seemed like he was breathing again  after it was confirmed he was breathing  but was still unconscious  the nurse and i put him in the recovery position and i waited with him till the ambulance came   im only    so this was a pretty crazy experience for me  the adrenaline in my body afterwards was so strong i felt like i was on drugs  sorry if this post was long or formatted badly  im on mobile  but i just thought it would be good to write about my experience  ,0

do you ever randomly catch a whiff of a specific smell and immediately think  hey  thats the way it smelled in the spring of      when i was playing pokemon at my grandmas house  obviously this specific memory is just an example but i feel like smells are very particular and can trigger a memory more vividly than any other sense  also  everytime a new season begins and the smell of the air changes i become very nostalgic and have a rush of memories from that season from various different years  ,0

ive always secretly felt like i was in second place  not quite good enough  until last night  im    and single  i dont have any kids  my sister has a husband and   beautiful children  ive always thought it was my responsibility to be there for her  to help wherever i could   it takes a village  is more than just a motto to me  i help watch the kids  be there financially or emotionally  or whatever is needed  thats just what family does  the kids come spend time at aunt lisas house  hang out  play games  whatever  a few times a week i come over for dinner  im at all the soccer games  concerts  fund raisers  or school fairs  theyre just part of my life  my sister tells me regularly that she couldnt do it without me  shes super grateful  but still  inside  ive never felt like i was on the same level as her  like i didnt live up to what i could have been   a wife and mom   so this is the consolation prize  this is my second best place i could help the world  until last night   we were talking about thanksgiving  having it at her place  obviously  since she has so many more people and more room   she said it was weird to think that in    years she would have grandkids  if each of the kids were married and had just   kids each  that would be another    people  shes just always made the assumption that would happen  but then for the first time ever she said    but thats if they all choose to get married  if not  thats fine  if one of them doesnt  the others would have their own aunt lisa  and thats awesome    hearing that she thought that was ok for her kids made it all different  being single and a helper wasnt just a second place fill in  but an appreciated  important status  it made me feel valued  and i knew that my nieces and nephews would feel valued  no matter what their future holds   edit  thank you all for your support  and for sharing your own stories below  its amazing to hear how similar we are  bloom where you are planted  i hope you all have a great day  and please keep commenting     ,0

one year ago i promised myself that i would donate to wikipedia from the first money i earn  today i donated        ever since my family got an internet connection    years and   months ago  wikipedia has saved my ass countless times  i never really thought about donating  mostly because i was from a poor er  country  and i understood well when my parents told me that planning every coin matters  one year ago  when i started university i realized that soon i would be able to earn my own money  thats when i promised myself to repay those who have helped me in life  for the last three weeks i was able to find a holiday job in the uk  and i earned my first real spending money  and today i honored my promise  i donated what i could afford to wikipedia   thank you wikipedia  keep doing what youre doing  ,0

i saved someones life this morning    i live in colorado  and were having some crappy weather at the moment  it snowed all of last night and still hasnt let up  and its been about     f all morning   im in high school  and i was pretty pissed we didnt have a snow day considering the weather  i was just thinking about what i had to do today  and i wasnt expecting to have anything like this happen to me   as i was driving along  i noticed an suv with its hazards blinking spun out in the dip on the side of the road  the windshield was mostly frozen over  and a stop sign was crushed beneath it  i didnt see anyone in the car  so i kept driving   about a block later  i saw a small figure huddled up on a bench under a tree  they had their head in their hands and were rocking back and forth  they were only wearing jeans and a sweatshirt  i pulled over  rolled down my window  and asked them if they needed any help  a young woman looked up at me  and shed clearly been crying  she told me it was her car that had broken down back there and that her phone was dead  she told me where she needed to go  and it was only about two miles back   i let her in  and she immediately burst into tears  she told me shed been out there for over an hour  and the few cars shed seen hadnt stopped  she was shaking really badly and told me shed been praying because she thought she was gonna die  she was here from out of state visiting a friend and didnt have any cash on her and she was really far from her hotel   i let her use my phone to call her friend  and dropped her off at a      shed been to before so shed have somewhere warm to stay while she waited  her friend picked her up at the gas station  and they both thanked me profusely   i started driving back to school  and i just started crying because of how long shed been out there  and how no one had picked her up   i feel really good about myself right now  even though i think it was just an act of human decency  i hope someone would do the same for me   edit  thank you for all the wonderful comments  and of course  the gold and silver  i think the world presents a chance to do something good to everyone  and today i took mine   edit     just to clear up a common point of confusion  she didnt know which direction the gas station was  or how far away it was  she was lost in a foreign state while it was snowing pretty hard  so i understand why she stayed by the crash  ,0

they say your late teens are the best time of your life  actually i think    and upwards is the best  thats when you stop leading life to impress or please  and actually start doing things because you want to  i used to be so scared of aging  had some sort of mild existential crisis because i was growing old  my skin was getting older  my eyes werent as youthful and full of energy as they used to be   but i actually am really starting to feel alive only now that i am     i think its around this time that you stop spending every minute obsessing what people think  how you are seen  how you look  what you do  and actually start making choices because you want to   you decide who you really want to spend time with  how you want to pass your weekend  what music to listen to  how to dress  what hobbies to choose  its the time where the peer pressure starts wearing off and you realize all the worries about how you are perceived are in your head   i spend so many years worrying and agonizing over how i was perceived  only now i am starting to enjoy my time and stopped being afraid of both time passing and how i decide to spend that time  i have accepted that i dont look super young anymore and thats okay  and that i might not be as full of energy as i was  but thats also okay     x   b   edit  i know  i know people who edit are losers  just wanted to say  its so cool to hear all of your experiences and different paths and hear from so many people that their life got steadily better as the decades pass    ,0

ive been emotionally detached since childhood due to a chemical imbalance that prevents me from feeling like you do  my daughter was born today  and i finally genuinely smiled long story short  my brain just doesnt produce the chemicals needed for  well  emotions  happiness  stress  anger  sadness  i get a small hint of them  but then its just gone  ive been unable to develop meaningful relationships with peers  and i just dont simply feel attached to or love my family like you feel  but there was this girl in freshman year of high school that  despite my inability to show real  genuine affection  loved me unconditionally  the love i feel for her may not be what she planned for  it may not be the fantastic romantic experience we all expect  but i do my best to show what i can  its just hard for me is all   but today    years after i met that girl  my daughter  elyza  was born into this world  i feel a burning sensation in my chest  im smiling  and im so fucking excited im making a post about it  i feel happy  real  genuine happiness  ive had this feeling before  but either dulled or had the quick replacement of nothing shortly after  but im still happy  hours later   the worlds looking a little bit brighter today  and im glad i can say that without pretending  ,0

i had one of the most intimate experiences of my life  and it was just a conversation  last week i was sharing a hostel room with only one other person  he turned off the light to go to sleep  climbed into bed  and then started asking me questions about my life  we talked about our lives  our countries  his divorce  my future  politics  being a woman vs a man traveling  etc  none of it ever crossed the line or made me feel uncomfortable    we talked for hours  and i never even saw his face  since there was furniture between us and the lights were off  i think that helped us both be completely honest in our answers and emotions  it was just one of those experiences that will stick with me for a long time   ,0

met a small girl who had a similar birth mark to mine and cried about it i was getting ready to check out at the grocery store last week and i    f  saw this little girl   f  just kind of minding her own  she had a very timid   shy vibe and i for some reason kept looking at her     i realized she had almost the same birthmark that i did  almost in the exact same spot  so i go up to her and kind of squat down to her level and i asked     excuse me miss    is that a birthmark      i can see her father kind of prepare for something mean or rude to come out of my mouth     and she kind of whispered      yeah     and i flipped my hair so fast and got super excited and said  oh my gosh we are basically soul sisters look i have one too and ive only met one other person with the same one  do you believe how special this is  yours is even cooler than mine      and i watched her face light up like it probably never did before  i saw myself in that little girl when i asked her if that was her birthmark  she was also preparing for me to say something mean  kids used to tease me up and down over it  now i hardly notice it but as soon as i got excited and got up close and showed her the left side of my face she was thinking it was cool instead of thinking it was existing to be teased about     her dad stood behind her and mouthed  thank  you  and made a heart with both of his hands and i left  i got to my car and cried  i hope nobody teases her  she had an astronaut toy and she could be in space one day  no need to hurt that brain     edit  you guys  this was an awesome first day on reddit  i didn t expect this to blow up but i m so glad it did  thank you for letting me share my joy with you all   i still don t know what to do with the coins you guys gave me  or how to post a picture of my birthmark     double edit      birthmark pictures   https   imgur com a vjwaff   ,0
my    year old sister has her first date with a trans boy and she doesn t even notice she happily identifies as a girl     years old and she needs no explanation for these things   i asked one time  after she drew two women characters having a kiss  if she thought she might fancy girls  she said she didn t care  i said that was cool    she told me a couple days ago she s so excited because this guy asked her on a date  used to be a girl  none of her friends care  none of our family care  no one cares because it s just two young kids excited to dance at a disco together    makes me so happy  my family are so liberated   my mother helped her get ready and encouraged her excitement etc  not a care in the world  i feel so lucky   edit to say   there seem to be a lot of negative comments on this post  so just to clarify  at this age  the other kid won t be able to have any irreversible changes to their biological sex  just stuff that doesn t matter like cutting hair and wearing typical  male clothing   they are also not  dating  in the sense that many people have interpreted it  they went to a school dance together  they are about to transition from primary to secondary school   it s just like a ball    at the end of the day  all we want is my sister happy  she was super excited to have her hair and nails done  just painted with some plain polish before you all start freaking out lmao  and just go to this school dance with someone she s been friends with for years  some people aren t so open minded or liberal in their thinking which is very apparent in this thread  for some context i am actually a straight cis female  we have a straight cis brother and this is new for my mum  don t assume  like some people below  that we are are pressuring her in any way  we want her to know our family is a safe space where she can discuss her thoughts and feelings without judgement  it s important to us that if she feels like she wants to discuss anything like this as she grows up she doesn t feel restricted or nervous  please don t be so unpleasant and unkind  there s enough nastiness in this world  ,0

my little sister is so wholesome i got a call from the department of health in my state yesterday saying that ive been exposed to a positive case for the virus  as such i have been asked to self quarantine for    days  and therefore am limited to staying in the bedroom as much as possible  my mom is currently at physical therapy to help her recover from hip surgery  and my dad is at work because he cant afford to stay home as he is our only source of income and they wont let him work from home  its just me and my little sister  and she mostly keeps to herself  a few minutes ago she called up the stairs and asked if i wanted lunch  a little confused  i said i would like cereal  honeycombs if we had them  she then asks if i want milk in my cereal  because she usually has her cereal dry and the milk separate  but she knows im not like that  i say yes  i would like milk  a few minutes later she calls up the stairs   sam your lunch is on the banister   i get my mask on and go down the stairs to the bottom where a bowl of honeycombs with milk was resting on the flat topped pedestal thing that marks the end of the handrail  i bring it upstairs  and the dog pushes the door open and jumps up on the bed because i have food  my little sister goes to close the door  stops just before her hand touches the doorknob  pulls it back and wraps her hand in the end of her shirt  then closes the door with the shirt acting as a barrier  she asks if i need anything else  i say no  she says  are you sure  i say yes  she goes into her room   this is extremely uncharacteristic of my antisocial sister  who almost never does anything for other people without being asked  she truly is a precious thing who loves me very much and i couldnt be more grateful for her  i dont know what id do without her  shes the best  shout out to my awesome little sister  autumn  ,0

i dig that reddit automatically assumes that you want to upvote your own posts  no  really  pretty much what it says  i think reddit s default setting is actually a pretty cool thing  it suggests that we should value our own voice and that what we do  say  and are is worthwhile   i know there are a lot of people around on here that might struggle with such issues and i just thought it be worth pointing out that these little tiny things can be meaningful if we let them    ,0

i think of quarantine as a pause button on time  and so ive been working out and doing intermittent fasts at home  its been four months since anybody except family last saw me and im so excited to surprise everyone  i just wanted to share this with someone it honestly feels surreal to look at the mirror and see the best version of myself by far  and the only thing that keeps me going during these sad state of affairs are the surprised faces of all of my acquaintances when i see them next  use this time  if possible  to catch up on all those things you stored up in the attic of your mind  for  later   ,0
hobby based subreddits can be pretty elitist  whenever i subscribe to a hobby sub i end up unsubscribing soon after because theres always this mentality that if youre not sinking huge amounts of money into it  then youre doing something bad  i was subscribed to  r woodworking a few years ago and posted pictures of a wooden box i was making for my then girlfriend  it was made out of plywood i had laying around my house  and it looked nice  but i got a barrage of downvotes and people saying i didnt give a shit about my girlfriend because i wasnt using nice wood  sorry  didnt mean to offend you by being broke  and i just unsubscribed from  r vinyl because people were talking shit after i had the gall to admit i have a cheap record player that im ok with for now  until i can afford a better system  these people are sinking       into a setup  and im sure it sounds fantastic  but i gotta buy groceries too haha   edit  i just started a subreddit called  r brokehobbies for elitism free hobbying  check it out if youre interested  shoutout to  u selfassuredcarnivore for giving me the idea  ,0
never told anyone this but    this is a bit embarrassing  but last winter in my city it was really  really cold  i was young and paying rent and not making a lot  but id just been given my tips for the week so i was downtown trying to get christmas presents  i saw a homeless teenager lying on the sidewalk  and feeling the tips heavy in my pocket i pulled out a     bill and handed it to him  he stared at me and said  really   and i laughed and told him to buy a blanket and kept walking   when i left i realized how dumb i was  because i knew it was likely hed buy drugs or alcohol  however a small part of me thought there was a chance that hed put it to good use   anyways  the next week i saw the same guy with a brand new fluffy blanket over him   i didnt tell my family this or anyone else really because i feel so odd about handing someone     like that  especially since they know im tight on money myself  but i thought id share it here  maybe itll brighten someones day     edit  thank you for the gold   now i need to figure out what to do with it     im not really understanding the hate  even if i was a  karma whore   which im not  isnt this at least a break from all the sexual assault news and everything else thats happening  it was something that happened that i havent told anyone  so i thought id post it here      also apparently ive been featured on r humblebrag or whatever its called  if it came across this way  im sorry  like i said  i just wanted to share something positive   ,0

im crying at the bus stop because of covid     i only just returned to school today  my birthday was last month so when i finally met up with one of my close friends she gave me a gift   a beautiful notebook with a small personal note that was adorable  i thanked her and we continued about our days   i was waiting alone for my bus to arrive and decided to have a better look at the book  inside  it had the most heartfelt message i have ever received  telling me to follow my dreams and that she was so grateful to have me in her life  all throughout the book are little notes and drawings that are all connected to us   inside jokes  mutual hobbies   and i just cant believe it  i started crying without even noticing  i feel so loved and i wish i could repay her for all thats shes done for me  im going to keep it forever  ,0

lost my job due to coronavirus     hours later  i had a job interview at a medical hotline for potential corona patients  life plays weird tricks on you sometimes  first i was depressed when i lost my job because this would be the absolute worst time for me to have no job  then i get a call from the agency who got me the previous one  the medical service hotline need staff now  usually they are really picky but now its my chance and its better paid  i dont have to worry that my contract wont get renewed every year  its much easier  and they pay into a fond that i have since    years  which gives me pretty amazing interests  in addition i get a permission to leave my house during quarantine because im essential staff for healthcare  im quite confident i will get it   update  just finished the interview and did a test case answering  i actually got the job  thx for all your kind words  i really wasnt expecting this post to blow up like this  the thought that so many people wished me luck and hoped that i get the job actually calmed me alot during the interview  im sorry for everyone who lost his job recently and wish you all good luck at finding new ones  and that they are even better than your previous ones like in my case  still  everyone of us should push over goverments to take care of not just the companys  but also the citizens who suffer financially under this virus  not everyone will be as lucky as i was  and its a shame that many goverments let people alone with this  but no matter how bad it might look for you now  it will surely get better  lets remember this is the time where we need to take care of each other  to be kind and help those in need  those who cant take care of themselves now like people with no work  elders  handicapped or parents without someone to look after their kids  but especially those without home and the refugees that a trapped in camps are now more than ever in need of our help  stay healthy and much love to all of you   update    since many of you are asking for the job details or the company  first i live in germany  so if any of you are actually from here  i can dm you the company name if the company actually still needs people  because it was implied that i already had to kick someone out of his slot of this topic  seemingly my personal interest in medicine gave me an advantage  for people of the us  i was mailed from someone who does the same job in the us  contact me and i give you informations about this or the persons name if he agrees so we can see if we can help you guys getting a job like this  the way it worked for me that i applied via an german job site for an job as customer support in call centers  i didnt realize it was an agency  which i usually avoid because they take only people who collect social security in     in the cases because thats how they get paid by the state  i was invited because they charge the companys instead of the state  and they introduced to a company that serves insurance companys  but was fired before it even started because of the corona virus and the office closing  they would rehire me later they said  but the next day this lovely guy from the agency already told me about the corona virus hotline  i looked for jobs like this  just to see if the qualifications or something like that really are as exclusive as he said  but couldnt find anything  seemingly the agency was the only chance of getting this job at least in my case  and afaik they dont need more people  ,0
i looked up an old friend and im shocked at what i found when i was between the ages of    and    i attended an art camp in the summer for two weeks  i learned some great skills and met some awesome people  one of my friends  who i had a crush on  was a few years younger than me and we spent every day together  even in the midst of my socially awkward phase  i was able to find a like minded individual who enjoyed my company  but unfortunately this was shortly before the days of social media and we didnt keep in contact   tonight i was thinking about my past at camp  i remembered him and i wanted to type his name into google and see what popped up  i wasnt expecting anything  and to be honest i barely remembered what he looked like  all i knew was that he was african american and was from detroit   so i typed in his name and nothing came up  i then added detroit along with his name and an article appeared  i clicked on it and i found him  i almost didnt recognize him at first but i knew it was him  and guess what  he got insanely good at art and his pieces are beautiful  he also won a         scholarship for his artwork towards college   im so happy that he pursued his passion  im so happy that he stuck with it and didnt give up like i did  im so happy he won a scholarship towards college and is on his way to improving his life with something that he loves  i wish i could congratulate him and tell him how proud i am   edit  wow  this blew up which i wasn t expecting  thanks for the pineapple friend  happy i could provide a positive story for others to enjoy   ,0

i hate it when the result of my hard work is seen as the result of my talent since my childhood  labels like talented  naturally gifted  and intelligent were given to me by my parents and relatives simply because i used to ace my school exams  my memory was decent  and scoring marks was a mere matter of memorizing the content  rather than learning and understanding  receiving praise upon praise for this feat of memorization  i falsely believed myself to be a genius who could achieve any level of success without putting in much effort   after graduating from school  i entered university in pursuit of a degree in statistics  gradually  day by day  my superiority complex shattered as i observed people who were actually intelligent  who could grasp and learn new concepts without breaking a sweat  these people were not only intelligent  they were also hard working  they kept learning and exploring things which were beyond the degree curriculum  ironically  i found myself in the shoes of low scorers  whom i used to ridicule back in school  my superiority complex transformed into inferiority complex within a couple of months   then came the despair and clinical depression from not being able to understand concepts  scoring below average grades  and comparing myself to my classmates who had overwhelming academic   non academic achievements  throughout my degree ive struggled to learn  ive struggled in creating projects  which require applying your knowledge  and not mere memorization  i was forced to push myself everyday  finally  i managed to complete my degree with a cgpa of          the shift from excellent grades of school to below average grades of college has changed the nature of praise that i receive  now i get passive aggressive comments like   yes  you scored kinda good because of your intelligence talent  but youre not utilizing it to its full extent  you could do better if you worked a little   this pisses me off   i learnt to respect hard work  i learnt not to look down on those who have low grades  i learnt that talented people do have a head start  but thats not an excuse  for talented people as well as normal people  for not working hard   edit  thank you everyone for the supportive words and encouragement  ,0

something incredible  yet rather bizarre  has just happened to me  im a bit flustered and i just need to tell someone  ok  i must warn you that this is a long and strange story  sit down  bust out the popcorn  and prepare to be underwhelmed    a year or so ago  i was sitting around watching youtube  i didnt have adblock at the time  so i was watching an ad for the seat toca  a car   there was a song in the background of this ad  and i  loved it   the ad was only about    seconds long  but the song was bloody amazing  i was immediately determined to find this song    i started watching the ad on repeat  trying to figure out the lyrics so i could google the song and find it  my usual strategy   but nothing turned up    people in the comments section were discussing the song  several other people were trying to find it  someone said it sounded like a guy called mike something  i cant remember the full name of the artist   so i searched for mike something  and went through a lot of his discography  but still   no luck  i tried searching his name   the lyrics  but    nothing    i tried using shazam  for those who arent familiar  this is an app that uses the microphone on your phone to identify songs  the idea is that you play the song  turn on the app  and the app will tell you the name and artist of the song  but shazam was bloody hopeless  and couldnt identify the song  i downloaded the app  just for this one song  and deleted it when it failed me    at this point  i must admit that i was watching the    second ad once or twice a day  just so i could listen to the song  no matter how briefly    my next step was to  email the seat marketing department   im deadly serious  i actually did this  i sent a polite email  asking what the song was called  a few days later  i got a reply  the seat employee told me that the song was a special commission for this particular ad  and wasnt available for general release  essentially  its not a real song  and theres no way to find it    i was heartbroken  but also felt a certain sense of closure  i popped back into the youtube comment section  and let everyone know about my findings  i had been keeping my irl friends updated throughout this entire saga  they found it hilarious  and mocked me for the effort i was expending in order to find this song  im the kind of guy who can be very determined   if i want something  ill put a lot of effort into getting it  this was just another weird project of mine  which unfortunately didnt work out    but so it goes  i moved on  i almost forgot about the song   fast forward to today  about one year after i originally heard the song  i get a random pm on reddit  its from a user ive never spoken to  a user who frequents subreddits that im not subscribed to  i have no idea who this person is    the pm simply said     song   turn the lights down artist   bso  this song is on spotify  but not youtube or anywhere else  i made a spotify account  just to hear this song   if a random stranger pms you a song  you have a duty to listen to it  right   well  i think you can all guess where this is going  yes  yes  its the bloody song  its the actual  legit  full version of the song   i have no idea who that redditor is  i have no idea how they found me  and i have no idea how they knew about that song  im fairly sure i never mentioned it on reddit  i send them a slightly crazed reply  a mix of utter gratitude and utter confusion  my reply read as follows    oh my god  oh my fucking god  im actually freaking out    who are you  how did you know  what is going on    thank you so much  but also  what the hell is going on  their response was     shh bby is ok  i shit you not  never before have i felt such love for a total stranger    so  yeah  wow  this is a pretty huge deal for me    for context   heres the ad that started it all  https   www youtube com watch v hxkwhtrspvi   the song is called  turn the lights down   by an artist called bso  the full song isnt actually as great as i had hoped   but thats not the point    edit   ive just realised that this whole post might be construed as a pathetic attempt at viral marketing for seat  so i want to state that seat are a terrible company  their cars are awful  and they are capitalist pigdogs that do not deserve your money    edit     here  http   imgur com rx aea   is a screenshot of the pm   edit    last one  i promise   here  https   i imgur com gajvnao png  is the email from seat   here  http   imgur com txs ane  is the full unredacted pm conversation  i didnt want to post this until i knew  u thevikinghoward was comfortable with it   were starting to get an idea of what might have happened  but im not gonna tell you here because it ruins the story  this is not a marketing campaign  i am not a member of bso  and i did not fake the whole thing using alt accounts  shh   ,0

i adopted a teenage boy  i am a    year old man  my wife and i were never able to conceive  i wanted to help out a kid in foster care and give them a warm  loving home they otherwise wouldnt be able to get  unfortunately  adoption takes time and money and we were not able to for some time as our financial state was poor until the last   years     when we started the adoption process we decided to adopt a teenager instead as they are usually neglected because adults seem to generally want babies little kids     the boy we adopteds name is jonathan  he is     he had been through some tough shit  abuse  neglect  being bounced from foster to home and back again  he was suffering with depression  anger issues  ptsd  and an eating disorder     ill skip the boring process and tell you about what life has been like since we brought him home    it has not been an easy task  jonathan smokes alot  which we didnt know   when school started  we got notified that jonathan was skipping class  we confronted him about it and he just seems to ignore us or tell us its his life so he doesnt care  at first when we adopted him he was cautious because he didnt know how wed react to things   he thought he might get beat  now that he knows that wont happen hes gotten more comfortable which is good but he has also gotten more teenage ish and snipey     jonathan gets into fights  he was sent home the other day for getting into scrap with another student  when we confronted him about it  he told us we werent his parents and we should stop acting like it  we sent him to his room and basically grounded him  he got angry in his room and started punching the wall  i tried to be as calm as i could and asked him why he was angry  he screamed at me to f off and tried to throw something at me but i dodged it  i continued to be calm  i told him if he apologized for yelling at me and attempting to hit me with something we could go to the pub and talk through this  after a minute he apologized and off to the pub we went     he had calmed down a bit by the time we got there and served so i was ready to talk to him  he thought it was pretty cool that i didnt get angry or retaliate  i told him things are different in this house  i told him violence doesnt accomplish anything  after a drink we began to talk  i tried to talk to him about the matter at hand  why he was angry  i got a bit out of him  i wont give out all the details for privacy sake but i did get some useful information from his perspective that helps me understand a bit of what he is going through    since then  its gotten a bit better  once a week we got to the pub and he tells me some things  we are trying to provide as much support and love and care as we can  the other day he got mad and said we werent his parents  i said  but we are the ones who care for you   he is a bit secretive which is why the pub thing works well  we are working on trying to get him to control his anger issues  we signed him up for boxing lessons to take it out on a punch bag instead of property  he is enjoying boxing  getting him to eat is a challenge but we are working on that  too      i hope in the next years he can get better towards a bright future  i know this isnt really promoting conversation but i just wanna say if you can afford to adopt please do it  it can really help change  a persons life     edit  wow  gold  thanks  wow again   really made my night thank you   edit    since lots of people want updates i will give you guys updates in the future   ,0

i stayed up having real talk with my friends for a while tonight and i found out that pretty much my entire friend group looks up to me i ve had really low self esteem for as long as i can remember and i ve just always felt like nobody really likes me and they re just trying to be nice and stuff  usually when people try to compliment me i don t believe them because from my perspective i don t see how anyone in their right mind could think that   but anyway  i d heard bits and pieces of this before  but i was up at  am with two friends on a call and we were asking each other questions and they pretty much directly told me that everyone really respects me and that most of our friend group looks up to me and it just really warmed my heart  especially to hear from two people who are usually brutally honest about stuff  at one point i was asking them who they would consider their biggest inspiration role model and one of them said me and he told me that every time i text him and say i m working out it motivates him to get up and work out and eeeeeeeee it just makes me so happy that i m having such a positive influence on other people  edit  thanks for all the wonderful comments everyone  i don t have the time to go back through and reply to each one individually but i ve read all of them and they re so wholesome and i appreciate all of you so much  d ,0

until i started driving  i didnt even know i was seeing the world differently  it all started when i started to drive  i was    when i got my learners  i know but i just didnt feel ready  okay   anyway  when i started driving with my instructor   i noticed something with my eyes   i noticed that i couldnt see the road signs until i was right on top of them  and other cars looked different too  i just couldnt understand why   so i went to get my eyes tested at my local optometrist  he tested me for an hour  looking at different things  reading different lines on the chart and switching eyes and doing it again  he seemed puzzled but intrigued  at the end of the appointment he had results   good news was my vision was perfect  how can there be bad news if my vision was fine  the bad news  apparently  i wasnt seeing with both eyes   he sent me to a specialist  the specialist tested my vision for all of five minutes before he had the same result  i wasnt seeing with both eyes  what did this mean  the specialist asked if i had suffered any injuries to my head when i was little   i said no but that i did have an operation on my eye when i was a newborn    i was born    weeks early  one of my eyes was turned in and i needed an operation to fix it  while it was fixed  the surgeon did too good of a job  he made the muscels in the back of my eye too tight  or something like that  thus  my condition    the specialist said i have a condition called monocular vision  it basically means that im not seeing with both eyes   i see with my right eye mostly  the one that got operated on  and then when that eye gets tired  i switch to the left eye without me even knowing im doing it   the specialist asked me some questions  do i have trouble walking down stairs  how was my balance  did i fall over a lot  did things look flat   i thought back to my childhood  yes i did fall down stairs a lot  i always had to hold my mums hand or the railing when going both up and down  when i wanted to put something on the bench  i would miss it a lot   this is because i have poor depth perception and i cant see in  d very well  the specialist said that growing up  i would have found ways to deal with my condition without knowing  i realised that colour was very important to me  i thought it was just because i liked colour but no  example  if i wanted to put an envelope on the table and the table was blue  i would look at the colours of everything else around the table and say in my head  okay  the table is blue  just reach out and drop the envelope when its touching the blue   and thats just how i have learnt to deal with it   by looking at the colours  judging distance is hard but again  i try and use colours  the red car is bigger than the grey lamp post  when i pass the red car  ill reach the lamp post   sorry im not good at explaining it  i knock things over when im not paying attention and fall down stairs when i have to look up at something while im going down  i look for the lines of each edge of the step   i didnt know i was seeing the world differently until i got diagnosed  seeing in  d must be fun for all of you normal sighted people  ,0

this pandemic is honestly surreal  and we probably wont fully realize it until its in the history books  i think about this all the time    i mean weve all seen all this stuff in movies and video games  a virus outbreak  killing thousands  causing unemployment and the rest of it  i go to my local stores to get groceries and everyone is standing   feet apart  wearing masks  and disposable gloves  just like in a movie  every headlines news contains the latest statistics and updates on the virus and how to combat it  most people have been in their homes for months on end  yet we were kind of instantly accustomed to it  and theres the usual jackasses from the movies as well  denying existence of the virus and roaming about as nothing is afoot   i dont know  i feel like this is something extremely huge yet most of us probably havent even thought of it twice  thank you if youve stuck till the end of my rambling  ,0
i m done  i ve been putting it off but this morning i woke up and it was hard to breathe so i got up  handed my cigarettes to my mom and put a nicotine patch on  i m fed up man  i m    and have been smoking fairly heavily for    years  i ve never tried to quit before and i m pretty scared  earlier this year i switched to vaping for about   months  still smoking the occasional cigarette here and there  but it didn t work out    my mom was ecstatic when i gave her my cigs cause she s been trying to help me get in the quitting mindset for a bit now  she s an ex smoker herself  she smoked for    years until one day she got fed up and decided she didn t smoke anymore and never looked back  i hope that same moment is what i m having now    it s too expensive  i m tired of having to go outside in the cold to get my fix  always smelling like smoke and having to pop mints before i talk to people  and not for nothing but i ve successfully quit worse in the past  i m in recovery and have been clean several years now  i ve dealt with debilitating withdrawals and gotten through them many times  so this should be cake compared to that  right  i hope    i had a dream last night that i went camping in the wilderness with some friends  my senses were heightened  i could smell the dirt and the trees and could hear the wind and animals scurrying for miles   i remember looking up at the stars and they were blue and red and purple  like the night sky was a kaleidoscope  in the dream i kept making remarks to my friends how alive i felt and how i felt so much better away from all the light pollution and city noise    if that s not symbolic i don t know what is  i think that was my subconscious telling me it s time to cut this shit out and was probably why i woke up so motivated to quit today  i m scared  but it s time  ,0
life is better without facebook and instagram i deactivated my facebook a couple of months ago and recently i deleted my instagram app too   i didn t fully delete the profiles because they have a lot of pictures on them that i d never be able to recover otherwise   i have felt so much better now that i m not mindlessly scrolling through these sites and trying to show off how great my life is  i spend less time locked on my phone and i feel happier and more confident in general  i even pay more attention to my kids  i just think it s so narcissistic and sad how obsessed people are with these websites  i don t want to be one of those people  has anyone else experienced this  ,0
im married to a walking success story tl dr my husbands income just jumped from    k to     k  all our dreams are about to come true    x   b   edit    yes i know the difference between salary and total compensation and how bonuses work theres a breakdown of his pay at the bottom we did a lot of research before accepting the offer thanks    edit    thank you for all of your amazing  kind  supportive comments    edit    my husbands resources include  freecodecamp com  https   freecodecamp com   udemy  youtube  podcasts  and codecademy but he primarily used fcc  i will try to have him post his specific methods when he has some time   edit    explanation of how the bonus works    x   b   preface by saying we lived in poverty for over a year  my husband was in school  working on his doctorate in organic chemistry  the origin of all our income   and neither of us was in a good place  he dropped out  i quit my job  we lived off his moms money in a condo that his mom previously paid for  most months we didnt have enough money for food or gas  we went half a year without car insurance and couldnt renew our registration when the time came  so we drove with illegal tags  we lived in constant fear of getting pulled over and getting a ticket that we couldnt afford to pay  so we basically holed ourselves up and didnt go anywhere for about   months   it was the most depressed i think either of us had ever been  we were in extreme denial that things were okay   then we moved to seattle on a whim and my husband decided he was going to learn programming  he taught himself multiple programming languages and hustled his ass off for half a year  during this time i had to get a full time job and try to make ends meet  he spent all of his time learning  to the point where id get mad at him because we never spent any time together  we were down to the wire with money and constantly fighting and stressing about it   the time comes where he feels ready to apply for jobs  applies for two months straight  literally for   hours a day  just sitting at the computer  applying for jobs endlessly   finally  someone offers him an interview  its a small startup  hes been there for about   months now  they offered him    k  we became comfortable  moved further into the city  had a baby  have all of our expenses covered  but still dont have any real spending money  its all going to rent  bills  baby expenses  etc   three months ago  he decides to start applying for jobs again to try and move up  the startup hes at is going nowhere  the owners have admitted it too  theyre on a downward spiral  they also dont appreciate anything my husband has done for the company  on top of that  he works under a control freak who doesnt actually know anything about coding and has horrible time management skills  oh yeah  and they boasted about  unlimited vacation time  and then gave him  one     week     off  when our son was born   anyway  he was asked to start the interview process at a particular company   one of the largest in the world  dont think i can explicitly say which one  so well call it bigtech  started the process and went through the first couple of rounds  and passes everything before the in person interview  and then is rejected  heartbroken   a few weeks later  hes contacted by another team from bigtech  they say he did extremely well on the technical interview and cant believe he wasnt asked to come in   so he sets up the in person interview  he spends the next   weeks studying their principles and doing as much research as he can about bigtech  back to the old grind of not spending any time with me or our baby  just hustling to do what needs to be done   the in person interview is a day of panel interviews totaling   hours  he comes home exhausted and spends the entire weekend freaking out about how he did   then monday he got the call   we were thinking he didnt get the job based on the way the recruiter phrased things in the voicemail  he calls her back and she asks how he thought it went and then gave him an offer  we were thinking it would be somewhere around         k total compensation   but no  the team said he was a  very  strong

my husband said the most romantic thing to me last weekend my mom is a nurse  cns  working in a big hospital  shes over     and shes been training the other nurses on proper use of ppe  and she is exhausted  she told me the other nurses are scared  which im sure means she is too  i live on the other side of the country from her  she lives alone   my dad was also a nurse  he retired early due to his health  he was   years older than mom  and really beat up his body throughout his life   we lost him in august  i think it was a heart attack but ill probably never know for sure   with everything going on right now  i havent been sleeping well  im constantly worried about my mom  last weekend i broke down and told my husband i was terrified my mom would get sick and air travel would be restricted and i wouldnt be able to get to her  that she would tell me not to risk it  not to come  that things would go south quickly and i wouldnt be able to get there in time to see her  i didnt make it in time to say goodbye to my dad    so ill drive you there     reddit i didnt even think of driving home to her  it would take days and we dont have a car  he threw the suggestion out so casually but i know he means it  he would find a way to get me to my mom and take care of us  he dissolved so much stress with that one sentence   i love him so much  and hes so dedicated to me  even though im a dumbass who forgot cars exist  ,0
i told my kids that we were spending this whole weekend at a church conference  we are actually going to disney world  we have had a really difficult year as a family  our kids have been so patient as we have dealt with a lot of serious difficulties  we decided we really needed to take off work and school and stop thinking about everything to spend the weekend all together  they re not suspecting a thing  i m so excited for the surprise  i just wanted to tell someone   edit to add  we are here now  they started to get suspicious on our way there  they said there s no way we would really be going to something so boring and speculated about a few other possibilities but they slept on the drive so they didn t even know what state we were in  we maintained our original story  one thoroughly believed it  the other two remained skeptical  i got them t shirts and mickey ears and gave them to them to put on  thinking they d figure it out  but they did not  so we drove into the park and they figured it out then  they have said it s the best surprise that s ever happened  i ll post a video later  ,0
today  im   year clean off of facebook and instagram  last year on this day  i decided to quit both facebook and instagram for good  they were just a huge factor in contributing to my low self esteem and depression and i realised that all that happens there is simply a highlight reel full of fakeness  so instead i decided to relocate all the time and energy spent on them to being more productive  i started reading more  learned   levels of german and re ignited my love for drawing   i just had to tell someone and i cant wait to see what the upcoming years will look like when i continue down this path   edit  thank you for the awards kind strangers  ,0

do any of you pretend to not know a fact just so the person telling you can feel good for a short while  sometimes people tell me facts  tidbits or other random pieces of information and i pretend that i dont know just so that i dont      instantly shoot them down by saying  oh yeah i knew that      they can enjoy teaching me something   i feel like it makes their day a little brighter  especially if somebody with common interests to me tells me something  ,0

shout out to all the guys out there who are actually attracted to black girls as a black girl in the us  its pretty annoying and even a bit depressing to know that your demographic is the least sought after  im so used to guys  even the ones who are black  saying that black girls are the ugliest most undesirable girls and that they wouldnt date them  hell  i havent even met a guy who actually  preferred  black girls over all other girls  thats one hell of a rarity  it sure as hell makes me think twice about having crushes  because i always assume hell be yet another one of those guys  so when i see a guy who actually likes black girls  it gives me a bit of hope  i know most people will find this incredibly stupid  but i like seeing it    note  this isnt to mean that attraction to preference of girls of other races is a bad thing   ,0

my high school bully from ten years ago reached out to me today she found me on instagram and sent me a heartfelt apology  she called me a beautiful person who was fun to hang around and told me she regretted not being able to see that before  it was kind  and mature  and i really appreciated it  when i was younger i felt humiliated by the bullying and dreamed of revenge  getting that message helped me realize why forgiveness is so much better  even if it takes a lot of time  revenge just creates more pain  reconciliation allows everyone to heal and grow  i responded letting her know how i felt and that all was forgiven   edit    thank you so much for the awards  also  thank you to everyone liking  commenting and discussing  i m glad that this has brightened so many people s days a little bit   edit    wow  platinum       thank you so much kind stranger  also  this exploded over night  thank you everyone  i ll keep reading and responding to comments as i can    it s beautiful how both old bullies and the bullied are resonating with this and opening up about their experiences  for everyone bullied  i hope you escape have escaped that situation and have the space and support you need to heal  for bullies  it is never too late to stop bullying and start to change  even if it feels too late to reconcile with your victims  we all have the capacity for light and darkness  thank you to everyone choosing light  ,0
a male supervisor asked me if it was okay to hug me  this is really silly i know but it made me really happy  i love this supervisor he s got a kid my age and has a real dad vibe   one time we were both talking with a customer and he grabbed my shoulder  it was for a reason but i can t remember now  and i flinched hard   after the customer left he apologized and asked if i was okay   i don t like being touched and usually when people learn i don t like being touched suddenly  they seem to go out of their way to touch me  because for some reason it s funny to see me flinch   my supervisor is a very touchy person but after he learned i didn t like being touched he was very careful to respect my personal space  on my last day of work though he looked me dead in the eye and asked if it was okay to hug me    i ve rarely been asked if i wanted to be hugged and it was so nice and wholesome  i actually love hugs  i just don t like being touched without being asked  i m gonna miss this supervisor   like i said it s so small but it means so much that somebody actually took my discomfort into account and was so nice and respectful   edit  so people are calling me sexist because i specified my supervisor was a man  i didn t mention that i m a girl so it seems like a lot of people made assumptions  i am a girl but even if i were a dude i still wouldn t want people to touch me   i didn t intend for this to be sexists  i don t  like men or women touching me  this male supervisor actually talked to some of my female associates about boundaries  because they thought just because we were all girls they could be in my space all they want   it was meant more as a descriptor  so i m sorry if i offended anybody    this was suppose to be a casual conversation  please stop the hate and death threat messages  edit    wow  thank you everybody for your kind words  it s really the small acts of kindness and consideration that stick with you  ,0
i have way more respect for heavier people working out at the gym than for super fit people  just something i thought about after i went to the gym  i have so much respect for people who are heavier and go to the gym to change their habits than for people who are already very fit  i mean i still have a lot of respect for fit people but i think it s way harder to start and make a change and go and workout at a gym with other people looking at you  ,0
  years ago today  school counselors back in my  male        th grade said i would never make it in college due to my disability  today i  male      got my acceptance letter from csudh  congratulating my academic achievements in community college  i never thought id reach far from my education  ill start from the beginning   back in spring       i had a continuous meeting with my counselor  parents future rsp teacher student success counselor  and school psychologist  meeting in particular was about my academic performance in   th grade since i had a mix of ds and fs with only   as in only my history and law classes  the psychologist told me i tested in the category of low spectrum autism after months of testing in where i fell of my flaws  with the psychologist not giving me full  details on the symptoms of autism  which she and the student success counselor saying that  with your disability  you wont be able to succeed in community college or university with the disability and grades  which i had at the time  even though i mentioned how when she called me up to do the testing of my disability  she handled it unprofessionally and not falling in line with protecting my confidentiality as her assistant at the time showed up in my class out of now where to call me up out of the blue without asking the permission of my teacher to be sent  as such  my parents and i reported to the school how the psychologist handled the situation and i questioned if i really was not worthy of being successful later in high school and college for that matter   after   years of that event happening  graduating highschool  using my disability accommodations for studying college  getting deans honors in community college  getting as and bs in my time of community college from fall       fall       i got my acceptance letter from csudh saying that ill be doing my education there  i almost cried of joy seeing that envelope and knowing that i was able to prove the school psychogist and student success counselors wrong by putting effort into my education in community college and it did it all with the help of my family  friends  advisers and professors in my time in community college  since i thought that having low spec autism wasnt a weakness from what the psychologist said it was  but i understood that having autism wasnt a weakness  it was a gift  a gift that i learn different and understand things differently and thats ok  im happy where i am today   the moral of the story is  ignore the naysayers who say just because of what you are would define you as your weakness  but rather quietly put effort into your work or passion and that success would define who you truly are and use it to help people for good      edit    i know some people wanna know how the meeting came to be  it started in late       when the student success counselor called me in to know about my grades  she recommended mandatory tutoring and it didnt really help with my math since the tutor and i had a clash of who needed help and that i was just a slacker prior to   th grade  the first meeting took place late january       it included the student success counselor  my counselor  school psychologist  and my parents   discussing what i messed up on  after the meeting  the school psychogist and student success counselor agreed to take a test if i had a disability or not  the testing lasted from mid february to mid april    edit    to also clarify how my grades were like ill give you a brief summary of how both went down from the beginning of fall      to summer of       history grade a   i did pretty good in my class and i found the teacher super helpful to students  language arts  f  the class was filled with wannabe cool students who thought they were better than everyone  in reality acted less mature that even my   year old brother would act more mature then those guys no joke   my teacher kept losing my hw and classwork and thought that when i made them up  i cheated   earth science  d  i did try my best in that class  even though the teacher was very picky in who she gave the grade to based on our appearance   algebra    f   i really tried my best in that class  even though the teacher seemed like she recognized who i was based on what the tutor said about me   student and law  a  the only class next to history found interesting   teacher was a deputy sheriff who showed the class social and political issues  with us starting to do a topic on the news every wensday for homework  we needed to write one page and an article attached on what we thought about the news regarding social and political issues that we found interesting  with us learning about the psychology regarding the  richard ramirez and charles manson on what they did that caused the world in an evil place  it was a class that felt like a college class  a full   years before i enrolled in community college that would help me spark my intrest in majoring sociology where i am today  sidenote  i actually at one point in   th grade wanted to become a detective because i liked thinking critically about doing detective work and was a fan of mystery stories and video games like sherlock homes and persona   golden    spanish  c i thought it was ok  i wish it could of helped the teacher to motivate us to use the language in a more contextual and motivational way  overall it was ok  update  this reddit posts upvotes are over       lol https   youtu be  uddqn  hrg  in all seriousness  thank you guys for sharing your stories regarding the obstacles one had to go through in high school  life definitely does get better after high school ,0

my job is putting wristbands on people at a museum  my boss says i m the best wristbander at the place  here s all my wristband related wisdom  when you re getting a wristband put on  always put out your wrist with the palm of your hand facing up  that way it won t stick to your arm hair   if the adhesive part of the wristband doesn t align and sticks to you  fold it over   to take off a wristband  grab the loose part on the interior and pull it in the opposite direction it s facing  towards the adhesive   when putting a wristband on a small child  make sure you ask them if it s too loose tight    as for dealing with a child s wrist size  you can either wrap the band around the wrist until it fits  or you can make a  whale s tail  with the band  stick the adhesive strip to the underside of the band so that it fits the wrist and the rest of it will stick straight up   you can either cut off the excess or let it stay depending on the child s preference   if you know you will be wristbanding a lot of children  it can be helpful to cut some short in advance so that they re sized appropriately   if someone obviously wants to put a wristband on you  don t try to take it and do it yourself unless you re confident you can do it  you probably can t  it s hard to do one handed   when you have a lot of practice wristbanding  you will be able to do it very  very fast  use the time you save with the application of the band to make sure the adhesive is lined up   brace the band against the wrist with your middle fingers while you line up the adhesive with your thumbs and index fingers    and finally  every single person makes the joke that it s like going to the hospital to the club  you re not funny or original for that one  sorry  ,0

i just pulled an all nighter and let me tell you  it feels weird because of this whole coronavirus  i usually stay on my computer until  am or even  m  and because of that  i wake up either      pm or  pm  i realized that my sleep scheduled was f      d up  so i decided to pull an all nighter  stay up all day  and sleep at night at the proper time   i think i ever pulled an all nighter only once before  and it was an accident  spent all night playing heavy rain and didnt notice the time passing   but now purposely trying to stay awake all night  feels weird  i went to the bathroom and saw the sun slowly rising  and the atmosphere felt so    different  it was dark  but there were some beams of light appearing  i spent the next    minutes literally just staring at the sky  watching it slowly become clearer and brighter   i wont lie  it was beautiful  but weird  i rarely wake up early  and it was a whole different experience for me  i know this seems like a meaningless and rather childish post to share  but i just wanted to share my thoughts  besides  theres literally nothing else to do  and i wanted to kill some time  and decided to share this  so this subreddit actually helps me with this all nighter  too   i know nobody cares  but its currently     am as i finish typing this  its gonna be a loooooooong day today  people       update    bad news  my friends    when my mom woke up at      am  she urged me to at least take a hour long nap  and she literally grabbed me by the arm  pulled me outta my chair and placed me on my bed  as soon as my head touched my pillow    bruh    it was like a bolt of lightning  i just remembered waking up two and a half hours later   im still exhausted as hell  but it doesnt matter  i failed staying up until night again    lol ,0

i feel better since ive started treating myself like a video game character  so  a few months ago i was playing a survival game  in game i was repairing my clothes before hydrating and getting a full   hours of sleep  then it occurred to me  why dont i do this for myself  in game my character wore the best  warmest clothes repaired to the best of my ability  i stayed well hydrated and kept a full stomach whenever possible  i cared for my tools and tried to keep myself as healthy as i could  i looked for any books to increase my skills   and yet here i was sitting irl hungry  thirsty  and unshaven  in game i would try to improve my skills so i could get better gear and abilities but here i was sitting at a pc learning very little  i wondered why i would treat an avatar so well while neglecting my real health  since then ive tried to think of myself as a robot or game character    irl  my body will get debuffs if i dont keep it warm  fed  hydrated  and rested  those debuffs decrease my skills so im motivated to keep myself healthy so that i can progress as quickly as possible   life can be monotonous but people grind for xp or loot all the time in games so why shouldnt i sink some hours into a task for the hope of a better drop  leveling a skill  or finding a new questgiver    i have trouble making myself work out  however  its easier if i frame it so that  exercise increases my strength and agility so i can unlock new challenges or areas     if i keep myself shaved and groomed i  get an increase to my charisma which might unlock new dialog options     if i fail at something  maybe its just because im  underleveled for the area and need to come back later    in games its generally easy to progress because theyve been designed to be won  life isnt the same in many cases  but games encourage a sort of strategic goal setting that seems useful when it comes to self improvement  maybe im late to the party  but for some reason this idea has stuck in my head for a while now  i have a hard time motivating myself to do better but thinking about life in these terms makes learning new skills and getting new abilities seem much less complicated and more doable  i guess this is just a form of mindfulness for nerds but ive found it a lot more helpful than meditation  ,0

my boss sent everyone this  parable  today  she sent it meaning it to be inspirational i guess  but to me it is everything thats wrong with the current work culture in america today this showed up in my work in box as an attachment  everyone in the company was told to read it and  come prepared to the meeting to share your thoughts    here it is      there was a young man who had ambitions to work for a company because it paid very well and  was very prestigious  he prepared his résumé and had several interviews  eventually  he was  given an entry level position  then he turned his ambition to his next goal a supervisor position  that would afford him even greater prestige and more pay  so he completed the tasks he was  given  he came in early some mornings and stayed late so the boss would see him putting in  long hours   after five years a supervisor position became available  but  to the young man s great dismay   another employee  who had only worked for the company for six months  was given the  promotion  the young man was very angry  and he went to his boss and demanded an  explanation   the wise boss said   before i answer your questions  would you do a favor for me     yes  sure   said the employee    would you go to the store and buy some oranges  my wife needs them    the young man agreed and went to the store  when he returned  the boss asked   what kind of  oranges did you buy     i don t know   the young man answered   you just said to buy oranges  and these are oranges   here they are     how much did they cost   the boss asked    well  i m not sure   was the reply   you gave me      here is your receipt  and here is your  change     thank you   said the boss   now  please have a seat and pay careful attention    then the boss called in the employee who had received the promotion and asked him to do the  same job  he readily agreed and went to the store   when he returned  the boss asked   what kind of oranges did you buy      x   b    well   he replied   the store had many varieties there were navel oranges  valencia oranges   blood oranges  tangerines  and many others  and i didn t know which kind to buy  but i  remembered you said your wife needed the oranges  so i called her  she said she was having a  party and that she was going to make orange juice  so i asked the grocer which of all these  oranges would make the best orange juice  he said the valencia orange was full of very sweet  juice  so that s what i bought  i dropped them by your home on my way back to the office  your  wife was very pleased     how much did they cost   the boss asked    well  that was another problem  i didn t know how many to buy  so i once again called your wife  and asked her how many guests she was expecting  she said     i asked the grocer how many  oranges would be needed to make juice for    people  and it was a lot  so  i asked the grocer if  he could give me a quantity discount  and he did  these oranges normally cost    cents each   but i paid only    cents  here is your change and the receipt    the boss smiled and said   thank you  you may go    he looked over at the young man who had been watching  the young man stood up  slumped  his shoulders and said   i see what you mean   as he walked dejectedly out of the office   what was the difference between these two young men  they were both asked to buy oranges   and they did  you might say that one went the extra mile  or one was more efficient  or one paid  more attention to detail  but the most important difference had to do with real intent rather than  just going through the motions  the first young man was motivated by money  position  and  prestige  the second young man was driven by an intense desire to please his employer and an  inner commitment to be the best employee he could possibly be and the outcome was obvious    excerpt from   living with a purpose  the importance of  real intent     randall l  ridd     x   b   i read it and was immediately disgusted for a couple reasons      the boss had this guy working for   five years   and never told him he wasnt doing enough work to be promoted  the boss never made his intentions known to this guy  he was obviously a good enough employee to be kept for   years  but not good enough to be promoted   you dont think in   years the boss could have been like  yo  youre ok  but youll never be promoted because i dont feel you do enough extra curriculars for me      isnt this implying that the boss values employees going  above and beyond   thats cool and all  but doesnt this imply that employee    was working all this extra work   without being paid more    its like saying  youve worked here for   years but this guy is willing to put in more hours unpaid so he gets the promotion       is this how you motivate employees  when someone comes in to ask why they were passed over for promotion you humiliate them  that guy went in early and stayed late  but because his   intentions   werent  driven by an intense desire to please his employer  wtf    he is not valued as an employee  if i were that guy id be looking for a new job     how does employee    have the bosses wifes cell number  that is weird     x   b   what do you guys think  am i over reacting     x   b   edit          pm   yall  yall  the meeting happened and it was   wild     it turns out the boss sent this out to everyone prompted by a single employee who is leaving for another job    the meeting ended with three  count em three  employees walking out on their jobs    i feel like writing the whole story out but i have plans tonight   when i do would it be better to put it as an edit to this post  or start a new one  ,0
i saw   little boys raising money to get their mom a birthday present  disclaimer  i am not sharing this story in an effort to put myself over  puff myself up or say  look what i did   like so many do when they do something charitable these days  i m only sharing this story to brag about these three kids who i will probably never see again and to encourage others to be the change that they want to see in this world    i was driving to my younger brother s house a few days ago and had to make a quick stop to get some food at a drive thru  as i was driving  i saw three little boys  ages ranging from probably      years  standing on a street corner holding poster board signs  as i got closer to the stop sign  i noticed that they had a cooler and several cases of bottled water next to them  their signs read    selling  bottled water     soda      saving for mom s birthday present   this hit me like a ton of bricks  a little bit about me  i am a recently divorced  single dad who had to fight his ex wife for every other weekend and tuesdays overnight with my   year old and   year old sons  my kids are smart  hilarious  caring little boys and i hate that i don t get to see them every day anymore because of a divorce that i didn t want    these three kids standing on the street corner selling water for their mom s birthday present made my eyes well up with tears because it is something i hope that my boys would do as well  i passed by them and kept driving  but it was only because all i had was spare change in my cup holder and i felt like they deserved more than that  so i was off to the atm before my intended stop at jack in the box    there was a long line at the atm and i was terrified that i would get back to the corner they were standing at and they would be gone  luckily for me  they were still there standing in the    degree heat and waving at the cars as they passed  whether they purchased a water or not  i parked my car and walked towards them  walking up to the youngest one at first  i noticed when i walked up that he had been holding his sign backwards and had no idea  which i couldn t help but chuckle at  i also noticed a man that i assumed to be their dad sitting in an suv around the corner  i m a bald headed  heavily tattooed individual so i gave him a nod as i walked towards the boys just in case he had any concerns  i asked the youngest one if i could buy a water from them and he nodded his head and took me over to his oldest brother  the oldest asked if i wanted a soda or a water and i told him i would take a bottled water  he walked over to the cooler that had a tupperware container with a handful of dollar bills and some spare change  he handed me the bottle and said  that s a dollar  please sir    i took the water bottle and handed him     and told him  thank you  buddy  do me a favor and keep the change  okay    he looked at the two     bills and said  wow    thanks mister   like it was a disney movie  i told him  you guys are doing something great  i hope your mom has a great birthday  and i thanked them  turned around and walked to my car  i opened the water bottle and went back to my intended day of fast food and yard work at my brother s house    i ve got to admit  that water tasted great  it was worth every penny  ,0
today is my  fake  birthday before i come to the us  i had to pick a birthday because my family didn t know when i was born   we come as refugees many years ago and i have been celebrating my birthday on         i sometimes wonder if there is a way to find out what age you are  even the year is a guess      on the upside  it s been a great morning already since i spent it cuddling with our dog and bf  i am about to get ice cream cake with my bf and smoke since i have the day off   happy birthday to anyone one else whose birthday is today   i hope you don t mind me sharing your day   edit   wow   thank you everyone  it s really feeling like my birthday   am having an amazing day   edit   my parents were not educated and they come from a poor family   when we were born  no one payed much attention to it  there was no reason    then we migrated to a near by country because a war broke out around the same time i was born  that s how we estimated the year    when we migrated  no one took records if there were any   i hope that answers some of the common questions i saw   edit     if you have information about the test you take to find out your age  please send me the info   i see a couple of people saying it is possible  ,0
just got an amazing job offer  ive doubled my salary in two years  oh and im a high school dropout with no degree  im so freaking excited    i always struggled in school  ive had teachers tell me i was stupid  and classmates tell me i was a waste of space    i have my ged and some college credits  not even close to a degree    i started working at minimum wage when i was    and moved out of the house with no savings and no plan    had three jobs at one point just to make it by    ive had shoes thrown at my head by angry customers  ive been yelled at and put down by many more    clawed my way up to        negotiated     at the next job    in january of this year i was offered   k a year  salaried with benefits  which i had never had before    ive been really unhappy in my current position but didnt want to leave because it was such a huge pay increase from my last one    so the past two months ive been looking for jobs and have only been offered positions between        an hour with no benefits  no pto  nothing    i went on an interview today for a really interesting job with a property management company  the owner hired me on the spot and offered me   k a year   with benefits  and extra commission    and has other positions available that i can move up into within a year    i am so freaking ridiculously happy    its not nearly as much as some make  but i worked so hard just to get here and spent the last five years wondering if i was capable of ever making a decent living for myself    if youre feeling discouraged or like youll never make it anywhere  i totally get it  but if little old me can do it  you can do it too    i believe in all of you  have an amazing night    edits    holy crap i did not expect this to get this much attention  im responding to all comments and messages  and i thank you all so much for the amazing response to my spur of the moment post     why did i drop out    i always struggled with the rigid structure of school  and subject wise was very weak in math and often science because of the appearance math made in certain areas of science    i did excel in literature and history  and those were always my favorites  however i was often bored in those classes as i had often done my own research or had read the book we were covering two years prior    but i was bullied in multiple grades and have constantly struggled with what i now believe is adhd  which my dad was just diagnosed with  i will be visiting a professional after i transfer jobs to look into this further    fast forward to high school and i loved being in theatre and dance  but that was really the only thing keeping me in school  i often skipped to teach dance classes or left school altogether    i had mostly ds and cs except my art electives and english lit    i developed an eating disorder and started self medicating with alcohol and light drug use  by the end of   th grade my parents found out and worked with me to find counseling    i tried going back to school at the beginning of   th grade but i was just not in a place mentally that i felt like i could make it another two years and get out of high school with my health intact    so i talked to my parents about dropping out and they agreed that it was the best thing for me to get my ged and be able to move past this period of my life     why didnt i go to college    after i got my ged  the plan was for me to attend the community college near me to get my degree    however  after a couple semesters my parents  who have never been well off  fell deeper into financial issues and could not pay for my classes at all anymore    i didnt qualify for financial aid and didnt want to risk taking out loans that i may not be able to pay back    so  i applied for jobs for a few weeks but wasnt getting anywhere  all i had on my resume was a cashier job at a roller rink that i had in high school    i picked a shopping center near my house  and walked around handing out my resume  practically begging people to hire me  and someone did  so i got my first full time job making minimum wage at a retail store doing tuxedo rentals    i moved into someones spare room that graciously didnt make me leave a deposit and that i could rent month to month     so how did you swing this  exactly    my best advice is to out work everyone    it fucking sucks when you know youre working for less money than you deserve  believe me i have been there    however  you wont learn to do new things unless you do the new things    at my first job  in between doing my actual job i was on the sales floor even though i wasnt being paid to be there    i kept track of my numbers  and routinely out sold the actual salespeople    so when i applied to my next job  i had those numbers that spoke for me  so the next person was willing to take a chance on me that they may have not been willing to take had i shown up without proof that i had some skills    ive reorganized stock rooms  researched visual merchandising to help slow items sell better  ive spend hours watching youtube videos about how to improve closing ratios    i have also redesigned client info forms  learned how to design websites  how to run ads  how to create a successful social media presence and more    you will feel like youre working too hard  you are  but its only because you get to show that to the next person that will hire you and eventually youll be so valuable that people will offer you more money without batting an eye     whats this new job    its client relations and marketing with a property management company  i can make commission by setting appointments for the on site property managers in addition to my salary    but mostly ill be handling marketing and social media  working with the on site employees to get qualified leads  of interested renters    i will also be trained by the owner for a better role in asset management that i can move to next year and after that i can move again to being an on site property manager or another role within the company     oh well you just got lucky  thanks for bragging     to that i say    think whatever you want    i didnt come here to brag  i made this post in a moment of excitement because im proud of what i accomplished    if you want to see it as bragging  go right ahead   im fully aware that others are in far worse situations than i have ever witnessed  i have been fortunate to have an encouraging family that i will always be grateful for    i have never faced homelessness or crippling debt or major illness or disability    i know full well that there are horrible struggles that i could never imagine and people that have suffered unspeakable things    i have been exceptionally lucky in that regard  absolutely    but i dont think that discounts what i have worked my ass off to achieve  and im not here to have a competition over  who has it worse in life   someone is always at more of a disadvantage than i was    but in my life i have witnessed first hand people that have not given up even when people told them they should    i have known a woman who escaped a horribly abusive relationship with her three kids  she lived on food stamps  and my family would watch her kids while she worked late nights bartending while also working a day job and getting her degree so she could move ahead    i watched my mom who has a chronic illness since    that didnt have an effective treatment that would allow her to keep a stable job until the last decade  go to nursing school  get her degree in two years and work her way up from a cna to a nurse and was recruited earlier this year for an amazing position in a renowned hospital across the country    my grandparents moved here from cuba with no money  had family members killed in the process  they didnt speak any english  they came to this country and started selling water and flowers on the street  and eventually started a successful real estate company   i believe that you can do it  even if you dont believe it yourself  and not because of what i have done  but because i have seen with my own eyes  with my own family and friends  the incredible things that people are capable of    more edits   im a lady  not a sir  just to clear up the confusion in the comments haha  also if any of you lovely commenters would like to speak at more length  just send me a message  it may take me the next few days to get back to you as ive gotten such an overwhelming response to this post  but im happy to talk with you  ,0

i finished high school with a     gpa last week  and i feel so incredibly proud of myself  last week was my final week of high school  i feel a little sad because i never really got to say goodbye  but more so i feel really  really proud of myself  the last   years have been extremely rough  but ive grown  so much  and ive come out on top  despite the odds often being against me  in the last   years  ive had to deal with loads of abuse  really bad social anxiety  a bit of ptsd and panic attacks  thanks to the abuse   deep depression  and so on and so forth  but no matter how hard life was constantly beating me down  i kept going  i didnt stop working for good grades and ultimately a better future for myself  no matter how low i fell  there were plenty of times where i didnt think i was going to make it  but here i am  somehow  by some miracle  i made it   with a     unweighted gpa  bumped up past   due to honors college classes and my schools grading system   multiple large projects and classes that i organized and helped teach  and   years early to boot  sorry if that comes off as a little braggy  but i just feel like     i dont know  i really did it  i didnt stop no matter how hard it got  and i managed to excel despite life constantly trying to beat me down  those   short years felt like theyd never end  but now im able to see that its over  i succeeded  and my whole life is waiting ahead   i guess i feel     relieved  its finally over  and im one step closer to being free to be my own person  i have the whole world ahead of me  and it feels  amazing   if i was able to make it through this  im confident that ill be able to go through anything   as soon as i take my sat and get the scores back  which got delayed because  you know  global pandemic  im going to apply to the college of my dreams  who knows if ill make it  but just the fact that i have a chance makes me feel like im on top of the world    i   did that    i   got myself here  for the first time in a very long time  im really  really    proud    of myself   d i just want to say that for anyone else whos struggling right now  keep going  even though im still young and i dont have much practical experience yet  i can promise you its worth it   edit  my poor inbox  i did not expect this to blow up as much as it did  edit    gpa is weighted  i was just very confused about my schools system and was told some wrong information  ,0

today i found a little girl lost in a crowded enormous park  and found her parents  i spotted a little girl  about   years old  crying alone in shock and running around a fountain  looking around  ive lost my parents many times when i was a kid  and each was more terrifying than the previous  i immediately knew she was looking for her parents  i approached her and she was clearly terrified of me  so i guided her to a bench nearby with as little physical contact as possible  i started asking around if they lost a child and got peoples attention  people gathered around but nobody was willing to go search the mother  its a gigantic park with tons of people around  i left her in care of an old lady who was really concerned  and moved around asking questions  people actually talked about seeing a crying mother looking for her child  so i made for the last direction they saw her going  i ended up finding her almost near the edge of the park  around     meters away from the kid  she had her daughter who was crying her eyes out  and her  presumably  old mother with her who guided her around  because i could see the mother was slowly giving up hope and was stalling around like a zombie when i reached her  i cant describe their faces when i told them that i found their kid and she was safe  the grandma was laughing with joy  but the mother was crying silently but looked extremely relieved  i was surprised how far i came searching for her parents when i was guiding them to the kid  after painfully slow minutes we reached the lost child and she had around her a lot more people  and the rest was a really sweet wholesome scenery  twas a good day  ,0
ive been depressed for a few years  but this weekend i followed through on my self promise to clean my house and told myself id clean my car today  and i did  im not looking for validation  just wanted to say that it helps to accomplish small self goals if anyone else is struggling  i still have a long way to go and had an especially rough night  but i had a good feeling when i got home in my clean car and was able to put my things down on my clean counter  it almost feels like im living a better persons life   to caveat  i wasnt living with rotting food or anything  just avoiding organizing  and still unpacking after   months   ,0

the older i get  the more repulsed i am about the idea of getting pregnant  let me start off by saying that i have nothing but respect for mothers  this is only my attitude for my own body and life    i m only     which granted  isn t all too old at all  but babies make me wildly uncomfortable and the concept of pregnancy is downright terrifying  everything from postpartum depression  to the physical effects of the body and how it would never be the same  and losing months of sleep for something i might end up resenting  that s not fair to anybody  i like the idea of being a mother  but i would rather adopt an older kid and skip everything i find deeply unpleasant  i know attitudes change as you get older  but i really don t want mine too  when i realized just how viable of an option adoption is  i felt an immense relief  i just can t see myself doing a good job of taking care of a baby and make so many sacrifices to my own body over it  ,0

today i was stalked by a guy in the dollar store    i    f  was in the dollar store and some guy seemed to be following my daughter and i around quite closely  i thought it was just coincidence and that he needed to get around us or something  so i said   okay kiddo  come over here   to my little girl and stood back a bit  the guy gets a surprised look on his face as soon as he hears my voice  looks over at me  and says  oh   and immediately turns around and heads back the other way    i hear voices from an aisle over as the guy  embarrassed  explains to his girlfriend that he had been following around some other lady that he thought was her  she burst out laughing and said   hahaha  that poor chick  she probably wondered why the creeper was stalking her             ,0
my girlfriend said a really nice compliment to me this morning on our drive into work and it made me cry quietly after she was out of sight  we were just driving along one of the main roads and i made some silly pun up just to drive her nuts and make her roll her eyes  she said after she finished groaning at the joke  you sound just like a dad   for me  i grew up with an abusive father  verbally and emotionally towards my mother and my younger brother and myself when we went to the other parents house every other week  afterwards she said i think youd make a great dad and i just couldnt help but start to cry once she went inside before me to work  i feel like im actually becoming a man and i feel as though not having a stable father figure from the age of   to    now its been really hard to really justify if i could ever be a good dad or roll model in the future     x   b   just needed to really tell someone because god i love this woman     x   b   edit  ill be sure to tell her once were both done work  shell probably laugh briefly and ask why it made me cry so much but it means a lot since my fathers father was the exact same with him  i said to her that if we ever have kids i dont want them to experience the emotional and verbal abuse my mother got from my dad  i was to be someone they look up to and feel proud of as their dad     edit    thank you guys for the awards  but go give your s o some extra love  if youre single and reading this  dont settle for less then what you are  youre amazing the way you are  keep being you and look for positive change  ill be responding to more comments periodically  thanks again all     edit    girlfriend has been shown the post  she says she wasnt aware of how many people were telling me to tell her about how much it meant with what she said  she wants everyone to know that if anyone is struggling with an abusive  or a hard relationship to try your hardest to help that person or yourself  not everyone can be strong or supportive so lean on whoever is willing to listen or help    i myself will be replying more and if anyone needs a friendly and well conversed person to vent or distract their mind im available to talk whenever  stay positive and kind reddit    ,0

yesterday i realized how cool my mom really is i mean  i ve always know this  but it hit me while i was driving  i was listening to some old songs i loved as a       year old  and i remembered whenever we would go on a long car ride she would let me pick the music   i was allowed to play whatever cds i wanted for pretty much the length of the trip  it was mostly emo bands and whinny songs about how hard life is  you know things i was an expert on at      my mom never told me to turn it off  change the song  or rolled her eyes at it  looking back she was probably thinking how annoying and bad my music taste was as i loudly sang along to every single line   she never made fun of my taste in music  she never stopped me from listening to what i wanted even when she hated it   i was an emotionally difficult child and she never stopped me from expressing myself through my music  interests  style  ect  with the exception of not letting me pierce my lips and eyebrows   which in hindsight is so glad for    i hope one day i can be half the mother she has been to me   edit  don t worry folks  i make her well aware of how great she is  i m so glad to see all the sweet stories of your moms too   to those that have crappy moms  don t worry  i m your mom now  drink water  brush your hair  i love  you  dinners at    don t be late  ,0

as a latino male  i miss being a kid and having our parents drag us to carne asadas every other weekend carne asadas are basically the latino hispanic  or in my specific case  south l a  version of having people over for a barbeque  parents would always know a friend of a friend that would invite eachother to the next carne asada     while the adults would dance and have drinks  while listening to the same cumbia hits playlist that no one ever seemed to update   my sister and i would have to hang out with the other kids that were also dragged there and it was up to us youngsters to find our own entertainment     it was always the go to classics like tag or hide   seek  sometimes wed make up games and just b s  the rules along the way  other times wed share ghost stories or urban legends just to see who would get spooked out first  if the adults were in a good mood  theyd rent a bouncy house just for us kids    it was back in the time of our lives where youd make friends with the other kid just because you shared the same favorite color  or had the hottest pokémon card at the time  there was no difference between girls or boys  we were all just kids laughing and running around without a care in the world     my favorite part of it all  however  was when one of my parents would realize i was really sleepy late in the night  prompting them to drive me back home so i could rest  theyd drop me off and drive back to the party so i was left home alone  most of the time the parties were nearby  only from a street or two across   i would lay down in bed as soon as i got home  and just stare out the window from my room to see the streetlights  the music and people from the party could still be heard very faintly  id hug my blanket each time id hear a car pass by  and id realize i was happy  id drift off to sleep with nothing but a relaxed smile on my face     i know carne asadas obviously still happen all the time  but i only just realized that as a    something year old  i havent gone to one in almost       years   and as an introvert  i also laugh when i remember how social and talkative i was as a kid      maybe when this quarantine is all over  plus an extra few months just to be safe   ill grab a few friends  a few drinks  the cumbia hits playlist that never gets updated  and just chill for a night  its been a while since ive done that    edit    i didnt expect this to blow up but guyyys  you guys are making me emotional with all of your own personal stories  i love reading them all  i guess i wasnt aware how much this hits home for so many others  if you guys are ever in the area  and i hosted a carne asada  youre all always invited    edit    so i couldnt come up with a full fleshed out playlist but these are some of the songs i can remember being played  theyre not really cumbia  moreso a mix of spanish favorites  https   www youtube com playlist list pllirowpflh  a vhdp   f cohfq cm i  edit    u wgporschespyder made a spotify playlist   https   open spotify com playlist    zqnbag  xh midytm   si w  e deurd bvtfz   ypa ,0

i gave a hug to a client earlier and it absolutely crushed me  i work at a veterinary hospital  i went outside to take a walk on my break  it s sunny out  a little too humid for my tastes but i walk anyway  playing pokémon go on my phone and swiping all the stops along the front of the hospital  a little strange to think there are so many animals here  and i m walking around catching pokémon    behind me  an older lady walks to her car  she s by herself  and sniffling a lot  i turn around to look and see that she s crying  she s holding an empty leash  i can only imagine what that means    i ask if she s okay  and without really waiting for her answer i ask if she wants a hug  she nods  and i hold her  she sobs a bit  she hugs tightly and as she starts to let go she hugs a little tighter  she repeatedly says thank you  thank you so much  for all you do to help the little ones here  i don t respond  i just keep hugging her  i start tearing up  too    eventually she lets go  i hold put my hands on her shoulder and give her a look to communicate that i share her sorrow  i ve lost all ability to speak  i wish i could say something  anything  offer her something more  but instead i watch her get into her car  and i turn and continue walking  ,0

my daughter just asked if i was alive in       i was      she was doing some school work and said   there was an earthquake in san francisco then       i told her that not only was i alive then  i was   in   that earthquake  and school was cancelled for several days afterward  and we had no power  either      was kinda cool to be able to give her a firsthand account of a  historical  event like that  but also kinda made me feel old      anyone else even been a living part of history  ,0
i misunderstood what a coworker asked me and gave him a response he wasn t ready for this is only my third week at my brand new job and i m still trying desperately to fit in  to set the scene  i m a younger female working in a professional office setting with mostly men  i have pretty bad anxiety especially since starting my new job but i m finally starting to break out of my quiet shy side and be more myself  yesterday morning after i sat at my desk  a coworker came up to me and said    him  can i ask you a stupid question  are you any good at rapping   me  i mean when i was like sixteen my best friend and i would memorize big l and eazy e lyrics and pretend to freestyle at parties because none of our sheltered suburban friends ever heard the raps before and assumed we were just awesome at free styling  always old school rap  we thought we were pretty good  but i mean i would never do it now  especially in public   him  oh  i meant  wrapping   like a gift   we had a baby shower for a coworker yesterday so when he asked me that question for some reason i thought  rapping   and wildly assumed he wrote a joke rap for her party and wanted me to help  i honestly have no fucking idea why my mind would ever go in that direction  but he wanted my help to wrap the gift he bought her  anyway i wanted to jump out the window immediately  tried to laugh it off and make a joke about it being  early  and  i haven t had my coffee       and i m praying to god he was so confused by my response that he wasn t actually listening   ,0

found an old ipod classic deep in my couch  currently have it connected to my pc and am jamming a ton of old music i cant find online anymore  major nostalgia trip  i used to have a massive collection of music in my itunes library  i played in bands and was involved in my local music scene when i was in high school college so im rediscovering a bunch of my friends old bands  long forgotten demos i made with people  and just stuff you cant get anywhere else today and it feels great   i used to take my itunes library super seriously and prided myself on not having typos and making sure song titles were properly capitalized and all that cause music has always been the most important thing to me and i felt like a curator of sorts and wanted to take care of my music collection   the age of ipods and itunes came and went for me though and ive since moved on to other music platforms  but my itunes library will always have a special place in my heart  to be able to see it and use it again is really something special to me    does anyone here still use an old school ipod for music  im curious    also  whats your guys relationship with music like today compared to when you were young   edit  a lot of people seem to be misunderstanding what i mean by songs that aren t available online  i m talking mainly about a  demos that i recorded with my friends which were never uploaded anywhere  and b  music i got off cds of local bands that i got at local shows which were also never uploaded anywhere because it was before streaming music became popular   edit edit  for those interested i ve put together a spotify playlist with about   hours of new  old  local  lesser known or just nostalgic music from my spotify library which you can find here  https   open spotify com user mtred   playlist  sw hciyexwmkrw m f u  si xrpbd enskmbfxqpuiwfbg ,0

i was googling some stuff for a webcam  and came across a unique webcam problem in a toshiba laptop where the video gets flipped  next day were interviewing a guy and his video is flipped  he said the it team couldnt help  i asked him about his laptop model  then told him how to fix it  everybody thought im a computer god for just diagnosing a problem just from the model number  i wanted to tell them it was the weirdest coincidence  but loved the awe so much i kept it to myself   feel kinda good  kinda guilty   edit  so to explain  on one toshiba laptop model  an older one i guess   toshiba installed the webcam upside down to save on space  and their drivers flip the image  after some freak windows update the windows driver overrides the toshiba one and flips the image back  unless you know what the hell youre looking for  who would guess that  ,0

i stood up for a lady on the bus a few weeks ago and pissed off the guy that was harassing her i take public transit  and while im quite introverted on the bus i  love  to people watch  i usually have headphones in and just peer over my phone and check out conversations  phone screens  weird hats   yes  im  that guy  but i promise it sounds more creepy than it is   i really enjoy all the different characters  there are lots of regulars  myself included   theres a guy who tries to sell his bus pass    on the bus  which usually gets  him kicked off the bus  theres a guy who refuses to sit down even when the bus is empty and tries to balance without holding onto anything  theres groups of sports fans and groups of kids that are probably way too young to be talking about what theyre talking about  and theres mary  i dont know her real name  because ive never talked to her  but she feels like a mary  shes probably in her early   s and is  maybe    feet tall  she has short curly grey blonde hair and wears nice matching pant suits  and she has some sort of facial mark  her eyes were sort of melted shut and half her face was waxy and smooth while the other was red and grey  super quiet  didnt make eye contact  and kids stared at her constantly   that was mary   months ago  lately i think shes had some sort of work done because her face looks so different  she disappeared for a while and now that shes back  she looks happier  she started wearing some makeup too so that might be part of the change  either way im happy for her  i really dont want to come across as judge y and rude  i just needed to point out that i have seen this lady for   years and shes been a bit of an outcast in the town   back to the story though  when the bus is extraordinarily busy i take out the headphones so i can hear if people need to get behind me or around me to the door  and today was that day  people were packed in like sardines and the bus was full of its usual characters  including mary who was right beside me  im    years old and about a head taller than her  someone comes down the stairs to the lower level where were standing and starts talking loudly  hes sort of shaking  hopping from foot to foot  he is in his mid thirties but dressed like and edgy teenager and has the widest eyes ive ever seen  no one should be this excited to be on a bus   no one   im pretty sure he was on something  or coming off something  or maybe he had some stuff going on in his brain that i wasnt equipped to diagnose  he was practically yelling when he sees mary  he lifts his hands up and puts a hand on her shoulder  im paying close attention to him and her face and everyone else on the bus  who are all turning a blind eye   hes yelling louder about sports and getting drunk and im sort of looking at this big guy behind our crazed friend  this guy is     built like a brick house  and has a lumberjack beard  polar opposite of me  the    girl trying to get his attention  he looks at me and shuffles backwards then turns around  alright  cool  friend is still harassing mary and i try to make eye contact with him  maybe get his attention onto me and off of her  shes very uncomfortable at this point and holds up her hands as a reaction to him having his arm almost around her  he grabs her hand and squeezes  and she says  the first time ive ever heard her speak in   years    please  stop  and he laughs   alright  mother fucker  im usually pretty introverted but today had been a good day and i wasnt going to let someone else have a bad one  i put my hand on his arm and he looked at me   dude  she asked you to stop  let go   he seemed sort of shocked to hear that  and he let her hand go  then he took his other hand and put it up to her shoulder again  ignoring me again   buddy  fuck right off  get to the other side of the bus and keep your hands to yourself    he gives me a cold glare and backs up  turns  and goes to the other side of the bus  no one cared  no one clapped  no one looked at me  everyone was willing to let this happen to her  and i was a little upset about that  i asked mary if she was okay and she said that he really hurt her  and i so asked if she wanted me to get her home  she honestly looked like she was going to cry and i dont know if it was from the guy  from me  or just the whole situation  she grasped my hands in hers and thanked me and we got off the bus together  she thanked me and we went our separate ways  i was honestly ready to punch a hole through that guy and im glad i didnt have to     x   b   so  yeah  thanks for reading  ive never told anyone about that before because i dont know how to bring it up without being really weird  it was out of character for me but ive stood up for a few more people since then  i hope mary is doing good  and i hope that she doesnt run into that guy again     x   b   edit  i dont usually edit my posts but a lot of people have commented on my writing  which is so nice  so if you want to read more im going to be posting more transit stories and fictional stuff over at r     writes    ,0
seeing the crystal clear waters of venice the fish swimming in the canals  they wildlife returning to areas around italy  while amazing also makes me quite sad at the same time  because i know that in a few months when the corona virus scare is over  the tourists will return  the ships will start up again and all the wildlife will disappear again   just seeing how it could potentially be compared to how i know it will be is just upsetting   edit  example   crystal clear canals  https   imgur com gallery xek  hi   dolphins in the port of trieste  https   imgur com gallery qgaayvi   ,0

i just found out that the afghan boy i taught his first german words is fluent now  has a job and will be able to stay here indefinitely  i am so happy i am a teacher and taught a couple of afghan women  ten or twelve  a few years ago at the height of the refugee crisis here in germany  as in  i taught people who lived in a gymnasium and slept on cots   even though i am a woman  it was difficult to connect with the women  they didn t know the alphabet and only spoke farsi  but there was a then    year old boy who came to every single class and basically helped out as a tutor  he came alone all the way from iran where he was born  but had an afghani passport  because his family sent him here  he had no future in iran  after two months  he was almost fluent in german  he did basically nothing else but study all day  his dream was to become an engineer and stay in germany  after he was suddenly brought somewhere else  this  infuriatingly  happened often   women i taught and had grown close to  whose babies i held while they wrote down letters and told me about their life  the boy translated    would suddenly not show up anymore and the others told me they were relocated  often without any warning   we wrote on whatsapp a couple of times but then life took over  i had a third baby etc   yesterday we met for the first time in three years and i m so proud of him  his german is fantastic  he finished school and is in a vocational training program  he joined it because he feared to be deported if he was just a student  in the meantime he got his approval to stay indefinitely and after his vocational training  he can go to university  he is so bright and such a joy to be around  i am so happy right now and apart from my husband had no one to tell  so i m telling you  reddit     ,0
i really enjoy having casual crushes on people  it sounds super creepy  but i like the feeling of forming a small crush on someone  not a sort of  hopelessly devoted  crush but something that just lets you appreciate them more  these kind of casual crushes are good because if you find out that you re not compatible or they re not interested  it doesn t take a lot of effort to move on    i like doing dumb stuff like taking the extra step to make sure  he  notices  and then realising how stupid i looked and just laughing about it  it makes things seem more uplifting   it s nice to feel giggly inside without worrying about the complications of any further steps   oh god  i hope i m not the only one who feels like this     edit  okayy holy shit this was totally unexpected to blow up  it s so sweet to see every single one of your comments and they re all so wholesome  i love hearing what you guys have to say  so thanks so much for sharing    ,0
my coworker made me cry today i work at a department store  and last week i had gone to a different floor from the one i work on to go to the bathroom and saw a sweater that i really liked  buuuuut it was way too expensive for me to buy  much like everything else in the store     when i went back down  i mentioned to two coworkers that i saw it and that it was super cute and i wished i could afford it     i didn t think much of it after that  but today one of those coworkers came in and said to me   go get that sweater you liked from upstairs     i was like   what     and she said   yeah  go get it  i wanna buy it for you     cue surprised pikachu face  i don t know her too well and maybe the sweater wasn t all that expensive in her eyes  but i couldn t imagine someone spending that amount of money on me especially someone who i d only interacted with a handful of times  i tried to protest and tell her that there was no way she was wasting her money on me  but she insisted     i ended up going and getting the sweater and she did indeed buy it for me  i cried in the elevator on the way up to grab it because i just couldn t believe someone could do something so nice for me  it really made my day  and it s something i ll remember forever  i hope someday i can pay it forward and make someone else feel the way she made me feel    edit  sweater tax because a lot of you wanted to see it   sweater  https   imgur com a xuj a r  ,0
what i learned from walking my dog everyday for a month  one month ago today  i realised i really wasnt happy with myself as a dog owner  and i decided i wanted to start walking her daily  this may not seem like much of a big deal to most of you  but ive struggled my entire life with doing things i dont feel like doing  and a routine  or any kind of discipline  has been something my life has never had    so  every single day since  we have done that  if it was raining  we walked  if i had worked all day and then been out the rest of the night with friends  we walked  if it was  am and id just climbed into bed because my dumbass had forgotten to walk her and then suddenly remembered    we walked    at the start of the month i really enjoyed the walks  i was keeping up with a goal i had set myself  the exercise and fresh air was nice  and dawn and i were regaining a bond that we hadnt shared for a long time  i snapchatted our walks everyday   it was fun to do  it kept me in check by giving me a sense of accountability  and i low key enjoyed showing off all the tricks dawn has learned over our years together  i quickly grew bored of snapchatting though  and ive pretty much stopped doing it entirely    just a short two weeks in  the daily walks began to feel like an incredible burden on me  and i often procrastinated until the very end of the night  quite a few times we walked well after  am  even though i started work at  am that very same morning  and boy did i desperately wish i was able to skip just one day when that happened   towards the end of the month  after enduring two weeks of what felt like what i could only describe as being cursed  i started loving the walks again  i began walking during the day again  choosing to walk before i did anything else i wanted to do   forcing myself to do something that was important to me  even on the days i didnt want to  has been nothing but life changing for me  the self imposed discipline of just this one simple daily act has changed the way i feel about and approach a lot of things in my life  and its significantly improved my quality of life and the way i feel about each day  im beginning to dedicate myself more and more to the things that are important to me  and i actually feel like i can achieve the things i want from life  as long as i put in that little bit of effort each day    i know i droned on about something very simple that doesnt actually seem like a big deal  but what i learned from walking my dog every day is this  if you have something that is important to you in life  and you take the time to work on it each and every day  no matter the costs or the obstacles   you will eventually see the improvements you wish to achieve    its up to you to decide whether its important enough to you to do it  or whether youre just going to keep making excuses for yourself  ,0

as an artist i make an effort to take out my notebook and work on a drawing if im sat next to a child on public transport  i want them to know that art is something they can pursue into adulthood  just in case they are a creative type with no other creatives in the family  i want them to know that there still are adults who draw  adults who appreciate comics  or who spend hours mixing colours on a palette just because it looks cool  i remember a specific instance of being on a plane as a kid and seeing this mid   s dude draw all these abstract diamond shapes in a leather notebook  it blew my mind  i bought a similar leather book immediately and still draw in that today  you never know when you might make a real impact on a kids belief in the viability of their passion   i always loved doing all sorts of art but my parents are both translators who come from families of doctors and psychologists and the general consensus of adults seemed to be that at some point during the mystery of growing up you put away the watercolours and go into academics  doing art was encouraged when i was   and ridiculed when i was     and we all know what the school system does to children who are creative    this morning i was on a   hours flight next to a little girl who was very entertained by my drawing and kept poking her mom to make her look and it warmed my heart to think that now  im that adult with the notebook on a plane  ,0

i walked in on my roommate cross dressing  and my reaction was not what i expected my roommate thought i was out of town on a trip with the rock climbing club for mlk weekend  but it got called off for bad weather  i turned back around and headed to the apartment  walked in  heard him taking a shower  now we give each other shit all the time  so i thought it d be funny to scare him  i hid behind a couch  ready for him to come out  he came out  walked into the hallway to a full length mirror we have  and    wtf  he had shaved his legs  was wearing thigh high black socks and a short gray skirt  a neck choker  had dark lipstick on  and had his typical neck length curly hair teased up into a more typical feminine style  the whole sight was shocking to me for a lot of different reasons partly because of how well executed it was  he has a lot of naturally feminine features and a thin frame  but clearly he has done this many times before  now since this guy really thinks he s the shit  he s a skinny dweeb  but a confident one   my first instinct was to jump up and embarrass him this would be something my friends and i would never let him live down  but that didn t really feel right  instead  i snuck out to let him do his thing in privacy and texted him   yo on my way back  trip cancelled   while i got coffee   the real confession is    i think he pulled the look off well    really  well   and i ve been thinking about it for a few days now  feels very weird  he has just been kind of a bro to me for four years and now all of a sudden when i m talking to him  i notice his lips are kind of a nice shape  that s the first first time i ve ever written something like that about a guy  the fucking son of a bitch got me  ,0

today for the first time in six years  my cat came to sit on my lap and cuddle i ve had my cat since he s been a kitten  he s never been much of a cuddler  he prefers being outside  usually he only ever comes home when it s cold out or when he s hungry  i ve always wanted a cat so i have a cuddle buddy forever but since i figured i can t change who he is  i just let him be  today  it rained outside and he got home to grab some food and i figured he d also want to sleep  he usually only sleeps in the living room since he brings home ticks from playing outside and it s too risky to have him sleep on our beds with the possibility of them dropping on our bed  so i went over to the living room and i sat down  knowing he d follow and possibly sleep next to me on the couch  but this time he acted different  he gave me this stare and just suddenly squeezed himself right onto my lap  i got confused but i let him  petting him until i heard the loudest purrs  he let me give him some pets and scratches until he fell asleep  he s currently still on my lap and doing these weird twitchy things  indicating that he s in a deep dream  i don t have it in me to walk away  he s so precious and i love him so much  it took six years but for the first time my cat picked being close to me and i m so happy         edit  this somehow blew up and i d like to let all concerned people know that the tick situation is always seasonal  specifically gets bad during spring to mid summer  but i ve got medication  which sadly doesn t fully work  and daily check ups and tick removals to make sure him and my family is fine  granted i am not perfect and i can t guarantee      that i remove all the ticks because some hide really well and that is why we have the preventive measure of not letting our cat sleep in our beds  please don t worry    also as to why i let my cat go outside   he is in our backyard and he has been for six years now without any issues  he is also neutered so if he ever escapes out of our backyard  hasn t ever done so but just in case  he s also neutered so there is no risk of causing any stray cats to be born into our environment  also he has gotten all his necessary shots  i love my cat and i ve always wanted a pet so i ve done massive research and i assure you i do my best to give my cat his best life while considering all factors around his existence    thank you so much for the upvotes and positive comments   edit    awards    you guys are so nice   thank you so much  ,0

i  f  grew up rural and was always intimidated when going to the big city  i felt  not good cool enough   now i work in times square nyc  and every time i see someone with  that  look on their face  i compliment their outfit  i can tell by their smiles that it makes them feel good my family and i would go to the big city a few times a year for things you couldn t get in our town  mostly clothes and appliances and such   i remember we d always put on our sunday best and  especially as a teenager  i d always worry that people looked at me and thought less of me because obviously we weren t as fashionable as them  my mom used to be scared to go into fancy stores and upscale department stores  thinking they d look down on her  i don t think they did though   now  when i see a girl or woman on my way to or from work   lots of tourists there  i can sometimes see the same look on them  and saying something like  i love that dress   or  omg cute shoes   in passing  and seeing their reaction makes me feel happy  it might be dumb  but at least harmless   edit  my first gold    thank you  whomever it was  you are gold and made me so very happy    edit    and now silver   i don t deserve this  but none the less am picturing myself swimming in virtual precious metals  like scrooge mcduck  thank you for making me feel special  ,0

my cat just woke me up by shoving a half dead lizard in my hand  and ive never felt more violated  im so outraged  i was trying to have a nice sunday lie in  and so i left my window half open to be courteous to the small bastard i share a home with  when i dont  he alternates between yowling at me to come in and cuddle with yowling at me to go out and murder things  so im sleeping the warm pleasant sleep of a kind and loving owner  when i kinda become aware of something being pressed into my hand thats kinda cool and rubbery and string like  this description fits nothing i know  and so i blearily open my eyes to look at what im holding    its a fucking  lizard staring at me from my loose fist   naturally i scream and try to hurl it away  but its not dead enough for that to work so somehow it clutches on to my comforter  so i scream curses and try to shake out my comforter  but its little cold blooded claws are holding on firm so i only manage to shake it somehow closer to me and near the curtain  the entire time my cat is just sitting on the bed  watching this whole production with the disinterested contentment he just stole from me   so i try grabbing him and throwing him closer to the target  but for the first time in his life this little idiot is apparently not full of murderous rage for moving things smaller than he is  and just stares blankly at it  when the lizard moves onto the curtain  i use the opportunity to stuff the whole thing out the window and beat it against the side of the house until the lizard drops away and scuttles off  my cat lays down on the newly stripped bed and thumps his tail in happiness    please tell me your sunday started better than this  ,0
started wearing a light amount of makeup  and it really helps my self esteem as a man  growing up  i    m  kind of assumed that i looked fine  and i never really paid much attention to my appearance  since i started working  i began to spend more on clothes and go for outfits that were a bit out of my comfort zone  and maybe since last year  i got more unconventional hairstyles since my barber said i always got something basic   it took a lot of swings and misses to find what i like and what i think looks good  i started paying more attention to my skin recently  and since the clothes i bought sometimes came with skin care samples  i started trying them out  i ended up buying full sized ones of ones that were nice  and i m sort of iterating on a face routine that is subtle  still don t totally have it figured out  but i found a cleanser  a sunscreen  and a bb cream that i like   i ended watching a lot of japanese men s beauty channels on youtube  and it was just eye opening to see how much goes into looking well groomed   clean  i get feedback from my girlfriend  and i ve definitely noticed more compliments on my appearance  if you re a dude who s on the fence about dressing better   skin care  paying attention to the little details is actually a lot of fun  and it doesn t take much to up your game   edit   a bunch of people asked so   here are some of the videos i was talking about  japanese youtubers have a different editing style that can be a little jarring   https   m youtube com watch v mzyyu nhvxa  https   m youtube com watch v co z v hfqo  https   m youtube com watch v fpnbq q xv   and i ve been using an app called yesstyle for clothing  sometimes they ll ship them with skin care samples  so i ve been using those to figure out what i like  ,0
my dad just told me he changed his faith over something i told him almost    years ago  i dont really talk to my dad  hes always been distant since the divorce  tonight we went to eat and he told me he took up my view on spirituality after being a strict evangelical christian following a conversation we had when i was     he said after that he stopped focusing on church and living a strict way  just focusing on being kind to others and finding heaven with his time on earth  instead of just living to appease something in the sky  the belief that any god worth following wouldnt punish a good person who was kind to others and handled life the best they can   we shared margaritas and talked about life a bit  apparently he isnt weird about gay or trans people anymore and actually had positive things to say  he thinks elton john and ellen are pretty legit  this is very different from when i was a kid and gay people were shameful sinners   its good to know that my dad doesnt live his life feeling like a guilty sinner   not implying hes gay now  and largely because of thoughts i shared as a teen  its kind of crazy because ive always imagined him as this way different guy  this maybe kind of personal or deep but it makes me feel good and i wanted to share with someone       edit   i elaborated more in a comment below but since some people are still asking about the conversation we had ill paste it here   it was on a bike ride we went on  he visited me while i was at a christian boarding school   which i was venting about    it wasnt one thing specifically  just a conversation about my faith  my frustrations with the church and religion  how unfair it seemed that someone could create a world of people  just to sit and get mad for them going about their life not singing his name all the time  expecting them to follow a ton of rules and live in guilt just in case there is some reward at the end  when people should be good just for the sake of it    that if there is a god and he is good  he wouldnt design people to live a life of shame  fear and constraint  he wouldnt judge the way many christians judge  that you should find the same happiness and beauty in life whether or not god is a factor  we arent simply just evil people born into the world waiting to be forgiven and taken home one day hopefully  we have to live like this is the only life we will get and make the most of our time   he said it sort of gave new meaning to a song like imagine by john lennon  where before it was offensive as a christian  the lyrics have a more uplifting tone when you look at that one line differently  ,0

my sisters cat saved our lives last night technically she has three cats  but this one in particular is a hero  his name is gaster  and hes one of the sweetest  friendliest cats youll ever meet  he also saved us from a gas leak last night   my mom got up in the night to use the bathroom  when she thought she smelled gas  gaster started meowing and rubbing against moms leg like he wanted something  she followed him to the kitchen  where he stood in front of the stove  the cats food and water bowls were full  so he probably wasnt asking for that  then my mom noticed that the stovetop was on  it was turned to low heat  but the flame went out and it started leaking gas  interestingly  we have a dog but she didnt notice a thing    she quickly turned off the stove and thanked the cat for saving us  gaster is our guardian angel   edit  paying the cat tax http   imgur com gallery iyj x g ,0
ysk  raccoons aren t actually washing off their food when they dip it in water this is a commonly misunderstood fact  i learned in zoology that they re not actually trying to wash their food  the type of skin and ridges they have on their hands can feel better underwater so they re really trying to figure out what it is before they eat it   here s some more info   raccoons usually wet their food before eating it  people often think that they are washing their food  but that is not the reason for the habit      raccoons wet their food to gather more sensory information about it from nerve endings in their paws  moistening food enhances a raccoons understanding of what it is eating     https   www andersonwildlifecontrolllc com why do raccoons wet their food  ,0
i  just called the national suicide prevention lifeline for the first time i never thought i d actually call them  tonight was supposed to be my last night  i got everything ready and just before i was about to start  i wanted one last person to talk to  so i googled their number  i know the rapper logic made a song about it but never remembered the number  and i made the call  i normally have trouble really opening up to anyone  i tend to not want people knowing how i feel  i got connected with a guy who sounded like he was in his later    s and really was not who i was expecting either  i had a light conversation with him at first just because i was lonely and it was nice to hear someone s voice  i decided to tell him that this will be my last night  and what conversation followed next was something that i really didn t anticipate for  after the call ended  i broke down and really couldn t believe that i was so close to not waking up in the morning  two of my friends have committed suicide this year and if only they had called what i called  i still would have those two friends      i came here to tell you guys about it because i have no one else to tell it to  honestly  you can ask me anything and i ll probably answer it  i m open to any questions or discussion  if you have anything more personal  you can dm too   edits   the number for the national suicide prevention lifeline is           talk         if you re going through anything  and you really think there is nothing left  just call them  i wouldn t be here right now otherwise    i want to thank everyone for coming to me to share their life stories  i will be replying to all dm s  pm s  and comments  ,0

today i made friends with an  entitled boomer  so i was at subway this afternoon and i was the only person in line  this older man  boomer aged  walks in and asks the employee who isnt making any sandwiches at the moment for  the usual   he doesnt go to the back of the queue like you normally would to start an order  and just waits at the register  effectively cutting me in line  he has a conversation with the employees  addressing them by name  because he really does come here every day  i was internally pissed off  and thought about calling him out for being an entitled boomer and telling him he needs to get to the back of the line like everyone else  but i held my tongue  even though he paid before me despite coming in after me  at the same time as i was pissed off  it occurred to me that this guy comes here everyday   he said  see you tomorrow  to the employees  and that hes probably a lonely guy in a regular routine  and he might not have thought much of what he was doing and how it might be affecting me  still not a great quality  but he probably didnt have malice intended   so i went outside to eat half of my sandwich  and there he was at the table over  eating alone  i was still pissed at this guy and was thinking about what an oblivious douche he is  despite this  i decided to start a conversation with him  he immediately lit up  i could tell he enjoyed the fact that a young person  me      was taking an interest  i asked him what kind of sandwich he got  since i noticed that its his usual and it must be good  we had a short conversation  all the while he was smiling and actually a really nice guy    this had the effect of not only brightening his day  but turning a negative for me into a positive  i wasnt pissed off at this guy anymore  and if i see him again ill definitely talk to him again  a lot of older people are actually very open to talking to young people    in fact they love talking to young people    but there is obviously a lot of animosity towards older people from young people  we blame boomers for a lot of the problems of the world  and its true  they have created the problems that face us today  but for the most part  they were short sighted and didnt know  institutions in charge knew  but hid it from the public   blaming and alienating them wont create any positives  having some empathy and kindness will  its hard going through life as a    something year old    imagine being    or     knowing you dont really have the opportunity to do much else with your life  and that youre in the final stretch  now add in that all of the younger generations pass you off and treat you as if you have nothing to contribute  im not saying its okay for boomers to act entitled and treat other generations disrespectfully  im just saying that they are just people like you who did the best they could with what they had  and that interacting with them can be a positive experience   this may have passed the realm of casual  but thanks for reading  ,0
my new boss has a first grader that comes to my office after school  apparently this little guy liked me  and he lets me know about all the gossip about me  i have started working in an accounting office recently  its rather a family place with flexible working hours and a relaxed atmosphere  we even have kids sometimes  my boss has a first grader  and after school he comes to the office for     hours until boss goes home  the first days i started working here  i noticed that the kid was being neglected  his aunt is my co worker  but she wants to be left alone to do her job  other coworkers have no family bond with him so they dont really give him much attention  my boss usually has too much shit going on  so he cant take care of him either  which is sad  anyway  this kid sort of looks like me  but without the glasses  if any of my acquaintances saw me with this kid and i told them that he was my son  they would buy it  its a joke im dying to try   he is also into gaming  and even uses some slang words that i use myself  i didnt teach him  he knew them before i met him   so i sort of bonded with this little guy and apparently he liked me too  now when he comes to the office  he sits next to me  i urge him to do his homework and keep a little eye on him while i work  nobody  not even his father  can make him sit down and do his homework  but there you go   he sits down and does his best to finish it  he also brings me sweets  candies  and even insists on sharing his chocolate with me    with all my coworkers except my boss being females  im aware that at least some amount of gossip is going on about me  its a fact that i accepted when i first started  and its really no problem  but last week  this kid took it personally when his aunt said that i  only work for myself  when i was outside on business  when i came back to the office  he said it out loud in front of everyone  and even pointed his aunt with his fingers  he also told me each of my coworkers responses to his aunts opinion  again in front of everyone  with all my coworkers faces going full red  and me giggling on my desk  we moved on  none of us mentioned this ever since    on a final note  i have a fear of children and i usually try to stay away from kids  after this incident im a bit nervous around him  since this can happen in other ways too  but then  i have bonded with him  which sort of helped me ease up  i dont know how to express it  but it feels weird when youre the only one that can speak some sense into a kid  i know that hes watching me and learning how i do things  so i be careful about how i do them  its amazing how a kid can change you   edit  holy cow  i had no idea this would blow up like this  thanks for all the support guys  for the first time in my life  i know that im doing something right   edit    thanks for my first reddit gold  i have no idea what it is but thanks indeed  ,0
today i went from being  obese  to just  overweight  on january   th      i stepped onto the scale to read    lbs which for my height of  ft   in put my bmi at around        today  january  nd      i stepped onto the scale to read    lbs which puts my bmi at around       which means ive gone from being classified as  obese  to just  overweight    ive stuggled with my weight throughout my entire life  i wish there was a good reason or explanation for it but the truth is i just hated exercise and loved food as a kid so i established very bad habits at a very young age  my weight has affected me a lot in life  it still does and likely always will but last year i made the decision to change and im still on that path today   i have a  goal weight  of    lbs which i absolutely will be reaching in the next few months and then ill likely lose another  lbs to   lbs after that if i feel i need to  im also going to start exercising more regularly to improve my fitness  i think this is going to be the best year of my life  not because ill be skinny or whatever  because im finally taking of myself and improving my health  ,0

always go to court for your ticket  always i recently got pulled over for expired tags  the car i was driving is mine  but i don t operate it regularly  my tags were  get this    and a half  years  expired  the officer told me that technically she should make me get out and have my car towed to my house  but she let me drive it home    i renewed my tags the next day  i figured out how much the ticket was          i wasn t really excited about paying that  so i put it off until my court date  i had never been in court before so i was really unreasonably nervous  i was terrified of court  i was afraid that the judge would force me to pay the ticket and court costs    everyone that went before me was ridiculously unprofessional  wearing t shirts and jeans in court  calling the judge  bro  and trying to speak over him  when it s my turn  i come up the podium  suit and tie  with all my paperwork  running through my defense in my head    i was prepared to tell the judge about how i don t typically drive this car and the tags just slipped my mind  hoping he would at least reduce the ticket price   he said  good morning  and stated what time i was pulled over  the officer that pulled me over  and the date my tags expired along with the date i was ticketed  he asked if i renewed my tags  and i said yes  i showed him the paperwork  he started laughing  and you renewed the vehicle registration the very next day   he went on to  commend  me for taking swift action on my expired registration and dropped the charge at no cost to me    i learned now that you should always go to court and just be courteous and truthful to the judge  generally the result will be more favorable ,0

my wifes biopsy came back negative and she is cancer free been worried the last    weeks  she had something removed that had spiraled out of control in a very short period of time  we had very good reason from all of the doctors that this was gonna be it  and if so  pretty darn bad  if it was what they thought it was  there would be no coming back from something like that   ive been there for her and been supportive but also been silently losing my mind  i knew if i showed weakness  she would just crumble  ive been doing my best  nightmares  panic attacks  all that  trying to hold it in and process things   i understand  part of the journey is the end   but im just so very glad its not now  we have so much more life to live together  fingers crossed   and i cant imagine losing her  im still pretty shook besides the good news  but im very glad that what we had feared is not happening  ,0
im finally back on reddit after the government shut down the internet wow  i am finally reconnected to society    the zimbabwean government had shut down all social media for several hours yesterday and then took it further by turning off the wifi nation wide all of today   i didnt realise how lost we are without the internet  even though it was just about    hrs  having no connection with the outside world was humbling  i missed talking with people on reddit about nerdy things that dont matter  i missed sending memes to my friends and i missed the freedom of information   i hope it doesnt happen again and if the ministry is reading this ill never see yall on the web again  see ya   edit  thanks for all the messages  i wouldve loved to message everyone back but social media was shutdown again  p ,0

my cat was missing for    days and i found him tonight  my   year old black cat went missing on april fools day  we have had a series of workmen coming in and out of the house to fix the aftermath of a leak that flooded the upstairs and downstairs   i assumed one of the guys accidentally left the door open  letting the cat out  i put up posts everywhere and searched the neighborhood desperately to find my poor missing boy   i had given up hope of finding him a couple days ago  maybe a sweet family had taken him in  he is so friendly i could see how that could happen   i was hanging out with my husband tonight in our gaming room  he was playing the ffvii remake  i told him i swore i could hear meowing  he said there were cats in the game  i heard it again later  it was my sweet kitty boy  duncan  he was trapped in the ceiling   we cut a hole in the ceiling and coaxed him to hop out into a laundry basket  he seems ok and is purring his little head off   i think when they replaced our bathroom vanity  he crawled into a hole in the wall which was subsequently sealed  we will take him to the vet tomorrow  poor thing probably needs fluids among other things   i feel a mixture of relief  joy  guilt  anger  frustration and sadness  this cat has been with me through thick and thin  sometimes the animal friends are the most honest and caring friends you can have  i am so happy he is home  but feel like i let him down letting him get in to this predicament  ,0
it s important to acknowledge every being if you are in the same room as them  no matter what the scenario is  this is something that happened a few years back while my grandma was in the hospital for something minor  she and another patient shared the same room  her roommate seemed to be really off and sad  i asked my grandmas nurse what had happened to her and i m pretty sure this is confidential info  but apparently she was suicidal and had no family at all  she was a bit older maybe in her   s  let s call her rose    as we were leaving for the day  i happened to look over at rose and said see ya later rose  have a nice day today  her head perked up and she smiled so big  my mother was in shock after saying that i have this gift to lift people up   i didn t understand what she meant by saying i had a gift because honestly  it was just common decency  i thought everyone was like this but after becoming more seasoned with life  i ve realized everyone is not  not sure what the point of this post is  maybe to inform people that a little bit of kindness can go a very long way   rose just needed someone to notice her  to acknowledge her even if it was just to say a simple  see ya later   being kind to people doesn t cost anything and it can actually change someone s whole day  even if it s just a simple smile to a stranger  ,0

my autistic son was abused by a teacher s aide i posted part of this story in a  previous post  https   www reddit com r casualconversation comments ceed a im taking my exwife and her husband on vacation  utm source share utm medium ios app  and a few people asked me to expand    this is a tough story  and i get super pissed every time i tell it    i live in a small town        people  small towns are great  but they are awful at facing their demons    why son was diagnosed with autism when he was two  over time  we realized that he was going to struggle because he could not speak  in kindergarten and first grade  he had an amazing teacher  she did really great things with him  he learned to speak but only in memorized words and phrases  we still cannot have a conversation with him  even yes or no answers are rehearsed and he doesn t always give the correct answer  he s a smart kid  but has severe communication deficiencies    his teacher left teaching to go to grad school at the end of his first grade year  so he got a new teacher it was his first year in education  the year started okay  but the teacher was not great  he restrained my son several times  during this time  a ta was working with him  we really trusted her  she would talk about the things she felt the teacher was doing wrong  as a teacher myself  it felt wrong to have conversations with her about this  but it felt great to have someone on our side    understand something about special education and restraint we are required to sign paperwork saying that staff may restrain him to prevent injury to staff  students  or himself  our problem was not with the policy  but with the frequency with which it was being used and the lack of reports we were given  the school acknowledged more than a year later that he had been restrained more than     times    we were baffled  his behavior at school and at home degraded so quickly  he was ok at home  but when we woke him up in the morning  he raised hell  he hated school  he was injuring staff members  while his behavior got worse at home  we were not seeing the violence  we felt like failures  we blamed ourselves    we tried different schedules  we tried therapy  we changed his diet  i took days off to sit with him in the classroom  something his teacher hated     nothing worked  he progressively got worse throughout the year  that teacher left  and a truly excellent teacher replaced him the next year  our request to the school was to keep the teacher s aide in the classroom  we felt like we could trust her    it didn t work  my son continued to have a melt down every time he was dropped off at school  he was still violent    i sat with my ex wife and we broke down everything we were doing at home that could cause this problem at school  but we felt hopeless  maybe we let him use technology too much  maybe that was why he revolted at school    one night  my ex showed up at my door  her husband kept all the kids so she could come talk to me   she was sobbing   i need to talk to you   she said  she handed me an iphone that used to belong to me  but i had given it to my son when i upgraded  she also had a list with specific times and quotes    she hid the iphone in his backpack one day with the voice recorder on  she listened to it the next day as she cleaned her house    the ta we trusted so much was so awful to him  she hit him multiple times  we could hear the thump followed by him saying   ow   she called him disgusting  she said   your mommy and daddy don t want to see you anymore    he hates it when people sing  she did it multiple times just to mess with him  the other ta in the room did the same  they always did it when the teacher was out of the room    i was livid  the next day  we went to the police with the audio  a sergeant called two days later  they would not be charging her  the school fired her  she now works at the local hospital    we saw three lawyers total  the first yelled at my son  the next two refused to take the case    we chose not to sue the school mostly out of exhaustion and feeling a deep sense of defeat  small towns suck    the good news  the school put my son in a classroom by himself for two years  they called his old teacher and begged her to come back  she did amazing work with him for two more years    he has had a different teacher for the last two years  she has also been amazing    it took four years to undue the abuse he suffered for two     tldr  my son was abused for possibly two years by a teachers aide we trusted  he is better now  but that took a lot of time  ,0

my husband said i was his favourite person in the world  and not directly to me  my heart just about exploded  my  husband  and i have been together for almost    years now  we arent married  yet  but we have   amazing boys together and our relationship is better than ever  though i do get frusturated sometimes by his lack of thoughtfullness  for example  he bought me the only thing i suggested to him for christmas  and he didnt bother to wrap it  it wasnt a big deal  but i was a bit bummed he didnt make the efford to wrap it  but later that day at his sisters house he was talking about something we did earlier and made the comment  of course  because shes my favourite person in the world   it just reminded me that though he might not be wired to be thoughful in the way i would like sometimes  he loves me with all his heart in his own special way and i couldnt ask for anything more  i love you baby    edit  thank you everyone for the sweet comments and advice  i appreciate you all  if you have that person in your life  go and tell them how special they are   its a superpower everyone has     ,0

my dog and i never bonded very well when i first got him   we lost our family dog when i was     she was an    year old lab and she was my best friend  my dad wasnt a huge fan of dogs in the house but he went to bed early and i would sneak wendy into my room and we would hug all night  even when she got sore i would set up the low couch in my room and we would just hang out and hug all night   when i was    my mum got me a male maltese shih tzu puppy  i called him wuffles  and though i loved him to bits we never bonded well  i would walk him  feed him  we would play a lot  but i think he connected more to the  pack leader  my  by then single  mum  he liked spending his time in her room when she wasnt home  and by her side unless i was being active with him  i kind of accepted that he wasnt going to be the snuggly dog id hoped for and that was okay  i kept up with all the activity  and bought a cat   they got along great  and my cat  ori  is the most cuddly thing ever  shes basically always on me or trying to get my attention for some reason or another  she doesnt really go outside if im not watching  and likes to chat and she sleeps with her chin on things   ori and i moved out of my mums house a year later but it was clear that wuffles needed to stay with my mum  he was insecure  didnt like moving and my mum had the backyard and the bond that i didnt really have   so    years later and ori and i have moved in and out a few times  something changed this time  he sleeps in my room most nights  he spends time with me just chilling  hes always happy to play and cuddle  and hes turned into my tiny shadow  honestly i really needed it right now   ive been getting unwell a lot lately and feeling really down about it  and without him i dont think id leave the house most days or laugh as much as i do    and now every night is a cuddle party  cat on one side  dog on other  some nights i get lucky and my girlfriend and mums cat joins me as well   theres no better way to sleep than awkwardly wedged between a heap of sleeping animals    i dont know why i wrote this  i dont know if anyone will read it  but if youve gotten this far  thank you  ,0

i thought i went blind and never felt so much panic in my life sorry for the formating im on mobile   so last night i went to bed and had a pretty restless sleep  couldnt really fall a sleep always turning to one side and the other  just terrible  around  am i wake up and i noticed my room is pitch black  which is very weird because there is always some sort of light in my room  there is usually light coming from outside from the lamp posts and i have plug that has a light turned on  at this point i think im sleeping so i stand up and i realize that im awake  so i start to get a bit worried  i decide to touch my eyes to see if they are actually opened which they are  and now im starting to freak out    i walk my way to the door to turn on the ceiling lights and boy didnt i turn that shit on and off hundreds times  i was panicking  put my head in between my legs thinking maybe there is not enough blood going into my eyes even though i didnt feel dizzy  still couldnt see shit and at this point my    year ass was about screem bloody murder so my parents could take me to the hospital because i honestly believed i went blind  i opened the door to go wake up my parents and when i get in their room i see light coming from outside and i never felt so much relief in my life  go back to my room to find my phone  touch it to see if it works and i see my screen saver and only then i could relax   turns out the power of the entire neighborhood went down at the same time this was happening to me  that is why my lights werent working and why the light from the street lamps werent working too    now that im writing this i see how stupid i was but honestly it was the most terrifying   minutes of my life   tl dr i thought i went blind because it was dark at night  im stupid ,0
a guy who used to be very rude to me back in high school apologized to me today edit  i apologize for not responding to everyone  i got really busy with things  i assure you i havent abandoned this thread  i just didnt expect to post this and come back to it   hours later all blown up  thank you everyone for responding  im doing my best to respond to all of you    so basically  back when i was in high school  there was this group of people who would treat me like an outcast  like i didnt deserve to live  and so on  theyd basically call me stupid whenever i failed an assignment  and diminish any achievement i made whenever i passed an assignment  to sum it up  they were dicks   i graduated high school back in      and within a year or so  high school started becoming a distant memory to the point where i was actually forgetting about these people because i was focused on doing adult things   fast forward to   years later  i actually met one of the people from that group of kids who used to bully me completely by chance  he was probably the nastiest person in the group against me  but now were both adults  were both equals   at first i didnt recognize him  because the last thing i remember about him was that he had sorta like a    baby face  i guess  now he looked completely grown up  when i found out who he was  i got slightly uncomfortable   then he did something unthinkable  he said that his actions against me were on his mind years after he graduated high school  and he apologized  i then explained to him that i forgive him  and that we were all dumb teenagers back then  now were both adults  and he seemed like he evolved into a completely respectable person   we ended up having a fairly long conversation with eachother catching up  even exchanged numbers  it was really nice   will i hang out with him again  maybe  have i held any resentment against him or the other people in their group  not really  ,0
the woman im dating hates cigarettes so i dont smoke around her and its been fantastic so ive been a smoker for about   years now      of the women ive dated were non smokers but they just tolerated it  i met the woman im dating a few months ago and i dont think ive been this head over heels about someone in a long long time  the only  issue  is she hates cigarettes and told me very early on that she doesnt want me to smoke around her  what i do in my free time is my business but she doesnt want cigarette smoke around her  very reasonable  told me that if it was a deal breaker for me shed understand    obviously id never not date an amazing woman over some fucking cigarettes so i obliged and now whenever we hang out im cigarette free  and honestly its been fucking great  there is no fear or anxiety about not smoking at all  just the excitement of knowing i get to see her  i barely get any cravings and when i do i just chew some gum and keep it pushing    ive been considering quitting for a solid year and i think this is the first step towards that  hopefully my next post here will be celebrating quitting   edit  thanks for all the support and well wishes  this sub is the best  ,0
i texted my husband after my afternoon hike to see if he wanted chipotle  he called me right after he got my text to let me know he was already in the parking lot and was just about to call and see if i wanted anything  so we ended up just meeting at chipotle and eating together  it was nice  chipotle is our favorite post hike place to eat  we were going to go hiking together yesterday  but we got some unexpected rain and ended up just binging netflix all day instead  so i guess we were both craving chipotle after anticipating it yesterday  i love when coincidental stuff like this happens between us    except when we both bring home each other chocolate  and then we just have double the chocolate and eat too much of it     edit  this is definitely not an ad  you can all probably look through my post history and see i m just a regular redditor  who mostly posts here and in r crochet because they re relatively positive and wholesome subreddits   i guess i could have worded this post without mentioning what restaurant we met up at to ward off the assholes   ,0

i accidentally flashed a group of people at a coffee shop today i was planning on going to a drive through  so i did not get fully dressed  i just slipped on a dress without undergarments as i wouldnt be getting out of the car  well  the drive through was closed so i went to another coffee shop by my house  no drive through  whatever  its a hipster spot so i reckoned i would fit right in without a bra  i brave up and get out of my car     right as a gust of dorian wind blows my dress up and reveals my entire nethers to a crowd of      people  i manage to cover my fronts bits and another gust exposes my rump  i got back in my car and went home  thatll teach me not to go commando  edit  thanks kind stranger for my award  also fixed my last sentence for clarity  thanks for pointing it out  ,0
i worked up the nerve to tell my wife something was bothering me i got a raise at work and it was a big deal to me  i work hard  sometimes long hours  and i got the max raise i was eligible for so i was super excited   when i told my wife i didn t get much of a reaction  our house is always hectic with two kids   and under  both of us working  etc  but really the only thing she said was that if she switched jobs and was getting less money  she s job hunting because her current job sucks  we wouldn t take as much of a hit   that really bothered me because i was excited  and i always try to go out of my way to celebrate stuff like this for her and didn t feel like i was getting the same thing back    i have a lot of trouble expressing my needs  i m not sure what it is about me but i just have a ton of trouble telling people i m unhappy with something  my wife and i have a great marriage despite that  god bless her  but sometimes it makes me let things fester   but tonight i did it  i straight up told her i d been really excited about the news and was disappointed she hadn t been  she right away said that she was and she was sorry she d been wrapped up in her own stuff too much to really express being happy for me   this is a huge deal for me  i very rarely work up the nerve to say something like that  relationships i ve been in in the past it probably would ve turned in to a fight  but my wife isn t that way  i feel so much better now   if you re emotionally an idiot like me  take the leap some time and tell someone what you need  ,0

im about to turn     and i still feel like i did at    i keep hearing about  adulting  and how hard it is  well  it is hard and doesnt get easier   at almost     i still get scared  overwhelmed and dont know what to do sometimes  i still have sleepless nights and wonder what the hell im going to do about some situations  the difference is i can use my experience in prior situations to assess the current one  or  even better  i have a circle of family friends professionals that i can go to for advice  ones that i trust  not the one on the next barstool or such   but inside  i still feel like im     i like splashing in puddles  i sit in awe of a star filled sky  i blow bubbles even when im not with the grandkids  i love shopping for new and different clothes in out of the way places  i still travel alone to places that interest me  i love to cook and try new things  i stay out late and sleep in sometimes  just not every weekend lol   i take up new hobbies and endeavors because they seem interesting  i still reach out to strangers and make new friends  so that i dont get bored  and i love a good whisky and the occasional drunk   everyone thinks  there is a magic age when you feel mature  its not true  as you get older you get  more responsible and you learn how to deal with difficult things because youve learned  youve learned consequences of being irresponsible suck  youve learned to deal with difficult things because not dealing with them is more harsh in the long run   yeah  adulting is hard and not fun plenty of times  but being irreverant  immature and irresponsible is a lot harder  a lot harsher and very damaging  it makes a happy life just about impossible   all told  im very happy to be looking at my   th birthday coming up  ive had a wonderful and interesting life full of amazing people and places  ive worked extremely hard to get where i am in life and i am enjoying every minute of it   my children are grown and i now have the time and the money to do just about anything that interests or intrigues me  i am not wealthy  i am comfortable    but that didnt happen magically  nor was it inherited or handed to me  it took planning and diligence  at times  it took a great deal of sacrifice and pain  during the recession i almost lost everything and i lived in a lot of fear during that time   but i had already learned how to handle things   it took learning to know what was a need vs want  it took learning to save and learning to invest   i could have a fancy new car  or i could take that money and do something smart with it and settle for a really decent car   i could rack up credit card debt that would take ten years to pay back for a trip to europe for a month  or i could travel when i could afford it  make the trips smaller  and use hostels  mid range hotels  campgrounds  etc  there is no need to go dirt cheap unless you need to  but no need to create debt  for the same reason  so  in spite of the recession  i survived those tough financial times because i wasnt carrying massive debt for fancy  expensive wants  so i could focus my financial survival on what was within my means   ive had fabulous experiences and travels and memories  i wouldnt trade it for anything  life has been good to me  but it didnt happen without me preparing for it to be so  ive had some extreme difficulties  some serious challenges and a lot of tragedy in my life too  so it hasnt been sunshine and roses  life never is  but it didnt make me lose focus  it didnt take me to the bottom  and it didnt cause me to burn bridges  i went through all of them  from the death of one child  through the mental health issues of another  and came out the other end a different person  but still one who finds a great deal of joy in life  rather than wallowing in the dark side of it   i hope everyone feels this way when looking at their older years   edit  i have to go off to my little retirement job now  thank you everyone for the kind and wonderful thoughts  have a loverly day  ,0

i learned in my microbiology class why so many young  seemingly healthy people die from flu  ive been in nursing school for a while  so i already have an understanding physiologically of how influenza  or any serious respiratory illness  can affect your lungs  ards  exacerbating underlying conditions such as heart disease  copd  etc   and of course we know that the very young and the very old are  typically  most susceptible to the flu   but what about people in their late teens and twenties   otherwise healthy people who are unlikely to have a chronic condition   well  in my microbiology class i learned the answer     basically  when the flu virus is done using your lung cells as a little factory to make more of itself  it leaves the cell by a process called  budding    some viruses literally rupture and destroy cells to get out  which is how they actually harm your body in that case  directly    but when a virus exits by budding  it just sort of pokes a hole through the membrane and squirms out   it leaves the cell mostly intact   but  it leaves influenza markers on the lung cell as it leaves   so now your lung cells look just like influenza  which triggers an autoimmune response   so your immune system attacks and kills your own lung cells  because they look like influenza   and the stronger your immune system is  the bigger the potential response   which is why healthy people with strong immune systems can sometimes be more susceptible to influenza than  say  an older person with a weaker immune system    because all the actual damage is actually being caused by your own body rather than the virus itself   edit  as other people have pointed out  this is called a  cytokine storm  and is not a normal or common response to influenza  but merely what can happen with some people   so dont get paranoid or think you have to immunocompromise yourself   a strong immune system is a good thing      of the time   i repeat  do not get paranoid   another edit   also  i am neither a microbiologist or a nurse  yet    im explaining it as a microbiologist summarized it to me for my small boy brain to digest   nor am i a doctor   so please seek medical advice from a licensed physician     moar edit   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc           an actual article with evidence based research posted by craylee that is     times more thorough than me  a goblin brained shell of a shadow   sorry if this isnt casual conversation  i just thought it was really neat     d  ,0

an underrated feeling  is when someone asks a question about something random  and you re able to provide a detailed and educated answer my friend randomly mentioned horseshoes the other day and how they seemed cruel  and i was quickly able to change their mind by explaining how the nails actually go into the hoof of the foot and not the meat so no pain as well as it protects the horse s hoof and offers better traction on a larger array of surfaces which is helpful in nearly all sport riding   i also got to explain why bodies are generally buried   feet deep recently   edit because people are too lazy to look at the comments  they actually technically aren t  but technically are  in      it was thought that burying the bodies   feet deep would somehow help limit the spread of disease  in reality  the hole is  ft deep  but then the coffin is put inside and  in a modern cemetery  there is often a concrete vault aligned overtop to avoid the coffin caving in  at this point there is about   feet of space left in which is filled with dirt  so     feet is a more accurate burial description  when s the last time you got to explain knowledge like that  ,0
today i finally said no a while back i figured out that im a people pleaser  i feel incredibly bad saying no when people ask me to do things  i become incredibly anxious  i overthink a lot  this predisposition to always saying yes  even if i dont want to  just because im scared of disappointing people  would bring me into situations that made me incredibly unhappy  that disrupted my path   well today i finally did it  i freaking said no to an important thing that would have set some setbacks to my career  and even though at first i started overthinking  i overcame it  and it felt so liberating  omg   i just want to say  if youre in the same situation as me  just do it  say no  take back the power  ,0
i just performed cpr on my neighbour and got him firing again  he is an older chap  it looks like he suffered a heart attack  i lost him three times and each time i got him back  by the time the ambulance arrived he wasnt firing again but they managed to resusitate him  this was quite the experience i didnt need  first aid training didnt prepare me for the screaming wife  the horrible death rattles and the whole thing but it did teach me enough to save a life  i reckon he owes me a christmas beer    update  his wife and two kids just came around to thank me very much and to say thay he is now stable at the hospital  i am crying like a baby   edit  i am a builder  not a doctor  there has been some discussion between doctors here about what went down so i thought id clarify my wording a bit  ive no idea if he suffered a heart attack or what but he was unresponsive  not breathing and no pulse when i got to him  he had recently been released from hospital for a stent  when i say i lost and got him back  he started breathing deeply on his own three times  each time i put him in recovery  hed stop breathing before i could find a pulse  id start cpr again  he was completely unresponsive when the ambos came  my father in law told me he was sitting up in the ambulance  i was in the kitchen freaking out    i posted here wanting to offload and share my big  somewhat scary experience with a few kind strangers  the love and positivity ive received has been amazing  stay brilliant all you beautiful bastards of reddit  finally  awesome job mods for keeping the trolls and haters at bay  over and out  ,0
boyfriend and i got in an argument about how we go grocery shopping he goes reallllllly slow  looking at all his choices and going back and forth back and forth  it was annoying because im there waiting with him to move on to other lanes but he just stands there thinking about what he wants  while i on the other hand just walk  if i see something i need i pick it up and keep moving    anyways  in the car ride back we were arguing and pissed off at eachother  and then i said  you shop like a turtle  and we both started laughing and that helped us say sorry to eachother  good thing we have a sense of humor   ,0
am i the only one who feels much more comfortable using reddit then any other social media out there  i mean hear me out  i get that reddit can be really flawed and very toxic at times  much more then other social medias  but even so  unlike other platforms out there  i feel as if i m more comfortable using reddit  for one  there are so many diverse subs  you can go from watching cats sit on trucks to literally bread stapled to trees  such diversity makes reddit so fun to browse  not to mention how easy it is to find a sub like that   not to mention how easy it is to get involved in a community  unlike places like facebook or instagram  i don t really need irl friends to find a place where i can comfortably talk post  on reddit as long as you post decent content you can spark up a conversation and gain traction  i m not saying that reddit is the best sm app out there  nor will it ever be  but i feel as if it s certainly better and more welcoming to me  ,0

my grown  business man neighbor is riding a unicycle up and down his driveway my husband randomly bought a unicycle at goodwill recently and to no ones surprise  decided it would be better to sell it since he wasn t getting the use out of it that he thought he would    we had a yard sale a few weeks ago and one of our neighbors came over to check it out  he picked up the unicycle and said he d take it  my husband and i laughed thinking he was joking    he wasn t   fast forward to right now  my neighbor is currently dressed in his work clothes  dress pants and a button down shirt  riding said unicycle up and down his driveway    pretty well i might add   i was having a rough day  but seeing a grown ass man casually ride a unicycle in business attire was everything i needed to see tonight    don t take life too seriously  kids ,0

kung fu panda saved my life  when i was going through a severe clinically depressive time in my   s  i was very inactive  mostly  i would lock myself in my apt and avoid everything   when i first watched this movie  it made me laugh for the first time i quite a while  i remember feeling something other than despair    thus began my path to betterment  i would watch it multiple times a day  it would be in the background ayong as i prepared myself  for the day  while i cooked  while i studied  and everything inbetween   it wasnt only the humor  it was also the message  there is no secret ingredient to happiness  i internalized this and it really seemed to help    fast forward multiple years  and this movie still hits me in the feels  it makes me emotional when i watch it    i love kung fu panda  ,0

i just walked into home depot after work  and one of the employees asked me if i was doctor  because i was wearing scrubs  when i replied  yes  he said  hell yea  keep up the good job saving lives man   and that completely made my day  it s been a rough month  been super busy at work and had very little time at home  and even less with my wife since she works a lot as well  it was just very validating to have someone say that out of nowhere    edit  wow  gold   i don t even know what to do with that  but i hope that the fact that someone felt like throwing some real dollars down here means it brought them some joy as well  there s too much negativity out there   we need more people like this home depot dude that sprinkles us with joy   he s definitely the one that deserves the gold  thank you very much  if i see him again i ll show him this  and buy him a beer or something    edit  been fielding a lot of questions about wearing scrubs outside of the hospital  which is an absolutely valid question   here  https   www reddit com r casualconversation comments aq vii comment egd dw  st js engil sh    dcebd  is my response to that   ,0

my son gave me a hilarious nickname  and i have never been so proud of him in my life  a few months ago  my cousin had her first child  they both came to stay with us while my cousin was cutting ties with an abusive ex  my wife and i were named as the babys godparents  which was a huge deal to me especially  if i was awake  the baby was usually in the same room as me  if not in my arms  i wanted to hang out with my goddaughter as much as i could before they left the state  my wife commented one night that i really shouldnt go by uncle bagel  bagel is what my wifes family all call me  the first couple times they met me they couldnt remember my name  so i told them anything that starts with a b works  as the baby is really my second cousin  not my niece  my son was walking by right then and pipes up   yeah  you should go by uncle bad jokes   you know  because you always tell bad jokes   we all started laughing while he walked away but i will always remember the grin he had after his first quality roast  it was better than seeing him take his first steps   i asked my wife the next morning if i was uncle bad jokes  did that make her aunty good jokes  anti good jokes  get it   she groaned and said that was a prime example of why i earned that nickname   both nicknames stuck  but every time i get called uncle bad jokes my heart feels too big in my chest and i involuntarily smile  not only did my son come up with a great nickname on the spot  but his first try stuck for more than a couple months already  that isnt a small feat for an adult  let alone a kindergartner                                                           edit  thanks for the upvotes and awards everyone  and an extra special thank you to everyone sharing their nickname stories  i cannot get enough of them  ,0
was feeling pretty sad yesterday  so i decided to go for a walk  saw a struggling old lady trying to take out her trash and decided to help  made my fucking day  usually  i would always try to ignore strangers and passerbys under any and all circumstances   my custom gold chain was robbed from me as a child while walking home from school   but the thing is  im tired of ignoring everything around me and becoming depressed by drowning in my own self criticisms that only lead me to mess up and hate myself even more  so  i asked her in english if she needed any help  she responded in a familiar accent and asked her in spanish if she spoke spanish  she looked surprised and said  sí       at that moment she began to ask me about myself and where i was from  i told her and she began telling me about her children  it turned into a lovely conversation about how we need to do more for our latino community  she seemed really well informed about politics and general understanding of the world  something that i never really see in the older generation of my ethnicity     the conversation gave me hope  i left it feeling more confident and proud of my roots  she said i should come by and chat with her anytime since she gets pretty lonely all by herself when her daughters at work  i might one day take her up on that offer  ,0
the worst part about reddit is being downvoted for something you posted with good intentions  whether it was an earnest joke or any other attempt at fitting in  whether it was something you posted or somebody you agree with understand  the  downvote to hell  phenomenon on reddit is both heartbreaking and one in which i participate   of course  i feel justified when i participate  but dont we all    its mob mentality  and unless you never downvote someone under    you participate in it  its both fascinating and devastating  like being on the playground at school  i suppose we should have thick skin  but theres little more threatening to human beings than to be  kicked out  of the group  to be alienated when you were attempting to be included    i think its what makes reddit such a fascinating platform  and i believe it has potential to be very unhealthy as reddit becomes less anonymous and more  social   soon  well have access to our followers usernames  i feel this will legitimize the  followers  aspect of a reddit profile  and where there are followers  there is a desire to know who is following who  sooner or later  reddit will become a regular social media platform  but one in which people can be publicly and easily  downvoted to hell    just food for thought   edit  im seeing a lot of comments along the lines of  who cares about upvotes downvotes   and my answer is    you do     would you continue to use reddit if every time you posted commented you were downvoted to irrelevancy  that you find  harmony  in receiving both positive and negative feedback on reddit does not mean you  dont care  about feedback   the upvotes downvotes make reddit a social experience  and without them there would be no point in reddit not to mention a complete lack of consensus which draws us to the platform  the only thing that motivates us to participate in discussion on reddit is the possibility and likelihood that we will receive feedback in the form of comment replies  positive or negative  and votes  again  positive or negative  up or down     even if you choose to  lurk  rather than participate  you do so because there is consensus  and you likely still participate in the consensus by way of voting  you feel validated by the chance to vote and participate in the group  without feedback  there is no communal  social experience    you are not exempt from  caring  about what others think  even sociopaths have a vested interest in the opinions of others  ,0

my    year old daughter was there for me yesterday when no one else was  i took my kids to a candy shop yesterday to buy one thing and my    year old daughter threw a fit because i wouldn t buy her something  xs the budget i gave her and long story short cried about it and after attempts at other suggestions she in the end got nothing but ruined our  mine and her   happy trip  to get them out of the house  she was angry with me and i at her  when we got home unrelated events occurred which got me in a depressed state  i tried to keep my distance from the kids so they wouldn t notice  bad day  well my daughter noticed my  sad eyes   and immediately asked me what was wrong  she hugged me  a good long hug  forgetting she was upset with me  it made me cry on her little arms  she proceeded to talk with me and just listened  i didn t give any feedback that was too deep but she did what i needed  just listened and hugged me  she then ended up putting us both to bed  she turned all the lights off  tucked me in and crawled into bed with me  i woke up at  am with her cradling my head  no ones ever made me feel that good  a    year old    update  thank you everyone for the praises and sharing your stories  this is overwhelming and i m so thankful  my daughter has always been a sweetheart  she s the kid that shares and doesn t like other kids to feel left out  she s always had a big heart  it makes me feel good reading comments regarding the parenting side of this story  believe me  i was feeling like the worst parent ever on that car ride home  but i needed her to know she can t just cry to get her way  she hasn t mentioned that toy since we were at the store yesterday but i about to head back to the store to go get it for her and surprise her  to thank her  it will be funny if the same cashier is there  i m sure she ll recognize me  it s a small store  thanks again  this really changed how i was feeling    update    i did get her the toy and she was very thankful  and to address concerns on me leaning on my daughter  i wouldn t in any way be that parent  i m very aware of how parenting skills and emotions  etc would affect my children at this young tender age  yes  i already do have and see a therapist  i started seeing one in january when i started feeling signs of depression which only just starting happening last fall  im very in tune with how emotions affect the people around us and would never put my daughter kids in a situation where she felt she needed to take care of me  we just had a moment and i was proud of how she handled it and i wanted to share   thank you for everyone s praises and concerns   ,0
i recently learned men are rarely complimented and when they are it makes their day week month i was reading on some random sub about things that make your day when a redditor said hes rarely complimented  he went on to tell how someone said he looked good in new jeans and how he still thinks of this random compliment and smiles  what followed next was many more male redditors jumping on and telling similar rarely complimented stories   i now find excuses to complement men  without coming across as flirting    hey  your hair is great today   or  geeze that blue sure compliments your eyes  because i would always say something nice like that to a woman and men certainly deserve the little pick me up we get each day   ,0

he spoke up for her mental health today my boss brought her baby into the office to meet everyone  we were walking around showing him off passing him like a sack of potatoes to anyone who wanted to hold him  when everyone was fawning over the baby  a co worker said to my boss  make sure you have someone watching you for postpartum because it sneaks up when youre paying so much attention to him that you forget about yourself    this particular co worker is well known as a man of few words until words need to be said  we live and work in a very conservative environment but he spoke up and said something   i was so moved by his kindness that i had to share with someone  ,0

i just found out my dogs old racing name  we adopted effie  a retired racing greyhound in march  just before corona started kicking off badly in the uk  and i finally got the papers from the adoption centre with her info on    she used to race on a track nearby  and her name was arksey flash  she only ever did    races  and she won her last one but apparently they retired her because she just wasnt very interested in it    we also found out her birthday  which we unfortunately missed  but hopefully after the coronavirus pandemic is over  my family will all be able to meet her and celebrate her gotcha day and birthday all in one    shes a really good girl  and adopting her is probably one of the best things ive ever done   edit  http   imgur com gallery gubqn m ,0
son s dance lessons  so small back story  i m  ft  shaved head  tattoos  stubble beard  bit grumpy and most importantly i have a nearly   year old boy   so for a few weeks now my son has been doing this weird dance thing where he wiggles his hips and swings his arms and basically looks like a bit of a sausage so i asked him about it and he said he was trying to do  the floss  because all of his friends could do it    at first being the rather grumpy man that i am i told him to pack it in and used some old cliche about not following a crowd off a cliff like my dad would have said to me  then i paused for thought for a second and realised how important it was to him to impress his friends and well let s just say i then spent a rather long morning watching youtube and dancing about like an idiot in front of the mirror and now i can do the floss and after about    minutes of showing him what to do  so can he    we look like idiots but i ve never seen him happier   ,0
ive legitimately died before and can tell you what its like  so i was telling an acquaintance about this and he thought it was pretty interesting  so i thought i would share it with you guys   about   years ago my friend and i were on our way to pick up another friend from work at around   pm  he was the driver and i was the passenger  we approach the intersection of my friends work traveling about   mph    kph  and as we re entering the intersection a girl on her phone ran the red light at about   mph     kph  and we t boned her  my seatbelt ripped the buckle from its housing and i went through the windshield   i m awake and conscious  i stand up and reach for my phone in my pocket  my arm feels like it s on fire but i get my phone out and dial     through the lock screen  i look down and i m pouring blood onto the street  as in a nice steady stream is making a puddle  people that had seen the accident  including the friend we were picking up  stop and watch me in horror as i walk around and hand my now blood covered phone my friend who is still stuck in the car  he takes it and i proceed to lean against the car   an ambulance shows up  straps me to a board  and starts to load me into the back  as the as the stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance my mom showed up at the scene of the accident  i never saw her but i heard her yell  i love you          i tried really hard but i wasnt able to reply   while i was in the ambulance  i started feel odd and  although it s weird to say  i could tell that my body was giving up on me    in the beginning my fingers started to go numb  at first in the pins and needles sense and then i couldnt feel them at all  i remember touching them with my thumbs and thinking about how weird it was  my vision blurred and would go in and out of blackness  i coughed out a  thank you  and for some reason an  im sorry  to the person who was working on me in the ambulance  i closed my eyes and i thought about my how my friend would probably blame himself and how my mom would handle it  i was    and still lived with her   my body started to feel really light  and i tried to touch my thumbs to my fingers again but my hands wouldnt move  everything seemed quiet to me  i could see that the person was trying to talk to me but it was like i was selectively tuning him out  instead i could hear my heart beat steadily getting further and further apart   my final though was  i wish i had replied to her    referring to my moms  i love you    after that everything went black  just like falling asleep   i was defibrillated  and let me tell you  it s a total sensory overload  it s like being kicked in the chest  it tastes and smells like hot copper  you see a blinding white flash  and you hear an enormous bang all at the same time   after i was defibrillated i had   shots of epinephrine to make my heart beat steady  the guy in the ambulance was literally crying because i had apologized to him before he had lost me  i later found out that my heart had stopped for     seconds   not an experience that i d recommend to anybody  but interesting to know about nonetheless   edit  organization   edit    i appreciate youre interest everybody but im living in japan and its about the time for bed  feel free to ask more questions and ill do my best to answer you when i wake up or get a free minute at work   aaaaand its morning                  the big bad list of edits                  this thread got way more attention that i had ever thought it would  thanks for the support everyone  and a big thanks to the person who gave me gold  it s the first time i ve ever gotten it   i m going to address some of the common questions i ve been receiving with this edit  i ll try to reply to all of you but it may take me a bit  this edit list will probably also grow steadily      i understand that some of you are skeptical and that s okay  it s hard to take in  i am not  nor have i ever been  a medical professional  so i am only able to tell you what happened through what i remember and what i was told in laymans terms  take it as you will  i assure you that it really did happen though      my primary injuries were major cuts to my face  shoulder  and neck  a torn muscle in my back  my trapezius  on the right side  and i compressed the spinal nerve that runs to my right arm  i had lost about       pints of blood and had some minor brain swelling  i still have full control of the arm and my only lasting side effect is neck that gets sore really easily       i didn t have any kind of out of body experience  i really fought for consciousness  when i started to lose control of my senses i knew it was a losing battle       i did not see jesus  nor did i see the flames of hell  there also wasn t a  light at the end of the tunnel  experience for me      i don t know what happened to the driver of the other car in a legal sense  i know from the police report that she survived  i did sue her insurance after they offered to pay only half of my medical bills  i won easily      if you want to use this story or any of my comments in a positive way  feel free      i did get to to reply to my mom in the hospital  i told her that i had heard her yell to me and she started to cry a lot  i gave her a thumbs up because it was pretty much the movement that i could manage  it was so awkward that she laughed about it

i cried in the bus yesterday  cause i missed my friend  i took a trip to go see my friend because he was feeling stressed out and depressed in uni  the bus ride is like    hours  when i got to his dorm  everything was just good vibes  met some of his dorm mates and they were all really nice and had a good sense of humour  we all took a tab of acid in his room  pretty much my first time  we had a baby sitter and shit  it was real safe  and devolved into a sludgy love bundle  all just cuddling each other  listening to awesome music  experiencing some cool ass art and just kinda bonding  when we came off the peak  his dorm mates returned to their rooms because it was like  am or something  friend and i stayed in his room and took the rest of the trip together  not sleeping and just chilling  we were cracking jokes  listening to our favourite tunes  talking about our feelings and how we are doing   when morning came  i had to get back on a bus to go home  we hugged  said our goodbyes  i got on the bus  the engine started  the world rumbled  and i started falling away from my friend  a piano sung a cruel song as i shifted a beanie over my eyes and tears quietly streamed down my face    i dont know when im gonna see him again  im leaving and im not gonna see him for a while  shit  im crying     reigning my thoughts    i didnt hate it  im a guy and rarely cry  im not particularly sentimental nor do i freely express my sadness  but i miss my friend man   and i love the fact that i do   lil bit of an update add on  straight up told my boy i missed him  flicked him a message that wrote  im crying on the bus homie and these tears are all for you  hope you got home safe     or something like that  he told me that he was safe and i was a big part of the reason why he felt so happy that day   also  i realise that i cried most likely due to the come down of the drug  that shit makes you emotional i get ya  but it wasnt a bad thing  i needed that cry and i needed the validation that i truly loved my friend     thanks for the silver  my dude  appreciate  ,0

praising keanu makes him visually uncomfortable  we as fans need to dial it back a bit  just read an article about people starting a petition to make him time magazine s person of the year  look  you love keanu  i love keanu  we need more people like him  but when you see people ask him  people call you the nicest person ever  what do you think about that   you can see he gets uncomfortable and shifts the conversation or puts the praise on the people he works with   i think we need to dial it back for his benefit  ,0
i work with a doctor who is wild about sweets and loves food  healthily   i think i found out why tonight and it nearly made me shed a tear  i m a nurse and i work in the recovery room area  so i have frequent communication with the anesthesiologists and we all often share food and treats amongst ourselves  one particular doctor will nearly bust down a door if he hears there s something sweet or tasty to be eaten  he heard there was cake in our meeting today and he came in and grabbed a slice  one of the other anesthesiologists who was giving us a presentation jokingly called him out on walking into our meeting just to grab some cake  we all laughed and went about our meeting   later one of my coworkers asked the food loving anesthesiologist if he s always had a sweet tooth  and he said to us   yeah i ve pretty much always been like this  when i was little i spent a lot of time climbing the counters just to eat spoon fulls of sugar because we weren t very well off and that s all we had for something sweet when i was a kid  and this one time i found what i thought were a bunch of chocolates in the cupboard  but it was actually bakers chocolate and it was terrible     this anesthesiologist is always the one who buys us a smorgasbord of pizza  pasta  and deserts on the weekends  he occasionally even bakes adorable cakes for us to eat too  thinking of this smart  humorous   now  very well off person as once being someone who had to eat spoonfuls of sugar just to have a taste of something sweet made me feel so sad  to him this was a very off hand  nonchalant conversation that he has probably already forgotten about  but to me it meant a lot more  it especially reminded me not to judge the kid who may want to grab some extra candy this halloween  ,0
i stopped a bully  yesterday i was at the gym  next  left  to me was a boy  person     who seemed mentally disabled  having conversations with himself and just acting different   he was having a good times   not much later two boys  person       i think they were around    y o   got on the treadmills to the right of me  they seemed to know person   and started with giving easy challenges  things like  can you run   km h  i dont believe it   so person   accepted the challenge  it seemed fine  however  after a while it got more intense  they challenged him to go   km h and i could hear person   and   saying to each other that it would be nice to see person   fall  bc of the speed  person   didnt get it that they were obviously bullying him  he probably thought it was just for fun   during the challenges i saw person   and   making videos  i assumed they were using snapchat  they were also making fun of him  after    minutes or so it was still going on and without really thinking about it  i approached person   and   and confronted them with their behaviour  at first they told me to shut up  as i didnt know them  which doesnt really matter in my opinion  as their behaviour was just unacceptable    i told them their behaviour seemed wrong to me a person   was an easy target and didnt see that he was made fun of  besides that  making snaps made it worse  person    the main bully  started to ignore me when i told him about his behaviour  however  person    he was not really giving the challanges  but just laughing and whispering ideas to person    started to talk  he told me i was right and their behaviour was wrong  after i though that i made my message   opinion clear  i walked away    when i walked away  person   whispered some shit to me  i didnt react to it  after i confronted the two boys  the bullying stopped  so i didnt care about what they thought of me  as i achieved my goal   im proud of my action  as i am quite insecure  as im pretty short for a man and look really young  im in my twneties and people often think i am    or      because of feeling insecure  i didnt always undertake action in similiar events  now i did and it proved i can do it    tl  dr  i stopped two bullies  helped a boy and proved myself that i shouldnt be insecure  ,0

paid off         in debt today i paid off         in debt  it took a lot of sacrifice and was really hard  but i finally did it  it s debt i thought i would have for years and possibly never pay off  i had trouble sleeping at night thinking of it and it s finally gone   i m just really excited and needed to share  but it s not something i talk about much in my personal life and my family wasn t super supportive so i m sharing here instead  time to start building up my savings   ,0
i ve stopped using facebook and instagram  leaving reddit as my sole social media outlet  who else has done this and how has it changed you  now  i m not going to claim major personal changes as it s only been about   days but i m definitely glad to no longer be inundated with the terrible  negative  endless crawl in facebook  while i may miss the habit of having the app to scroll through to kill time  i don t miss the information at all  i feel a weight slowly lifting  who else has done this  tell me about the positive changes it has brought you  ,0
i prefer reddit to other social media platforms because it isnt about people showing off how amazing their life is  anyone with me  im getting more and more disillusioned with other social networks like facebook and instagram as it is literally full of people comparing their lives  i work full time and so does my partner who works shifts and at the moment were saving for our wedding  this means we dont have spare cash to be jetting off to thailand or sipping cocktails in greece like the majority of my friends list seems to be doing  im  trying hard to lose a bit more weight to feel better on my wedding day but i dont have ripped abs and cant pull off a bikini so my insta isnt full of half naked shots of me in the sea  as someone who suffers with anxiety and constantly compares myself to others  its hard not to feel really low about my life  even though i know theres good things happening  its great that others are proud of their bodies and show photos of their holidays but people only seem to post themselves living their best lives  i prefer reddit because it seems like everyone here is so much more real about the lows and highs of their life which makes me feel so much more normal and not a massive loser compared to my peers  does anyone else think this or is this just me over thinking things    ,0

i work fast food and i ll just give people free stuff i work at a wendy s part time and sometimes i ll just give random people free stuff or i ll upsize their drink fries for free or slip in an extra nugget or two on purpose  sometimes it s just random people other times  they re nice or something funny happens  or if i get a good vibe from that person just depends   today this couple  at least i assume the were  came in and the girl was super shy  would talk super quietly or nod only look at her boyfriend  and i thought it was adorable  guy orders their food and when i m bagging it up i give a medium fry instead of a small and a few extra nuggs for the girl    it s a relatively small gesture but i like to think that it makes at least someone s day    edit  i don t do this for everyone not even regulars usually only if it s a slower day and we have a bunch of stuff about to go bad  yes this could get me fired but i get paid minimum wage and it s my side job     ツ      also i m happy to hear from those of you on the receiving end and those who also do these nice gestures every once in a while    and thank you for the silver my first one  this post blew up over night  ,0

all of the hours i have wasted people watching have been worth it for this moment this happened a few days ago but its still warming my heart so i just wanna share this fuzzy feeling around    let me set the scene  i am an international student at a chinese university  my dorm is pretty swanky  i have a balcony where i often sit with a coffee surveying whats going on below  the view looks down onto the entrance to the preforming arts building  its a tropical climate so theres often practice happening outside which is entertaining   on this day though only people in sight are a couple  nothing of great interest  standard cutesy stuff  until the girl heads inside  after shes gone the boyfriend starts walking away with a skip in his step and he outstretches his arms looks to the sky and has his own celebration  like fist pumps massive grin this guy feels like the luckiest guy in the whole world    honestly it was like something out of a movie  this culture is normally pretty reserved  he had no idea anyone could see him he just simply could not contain his happiness  what makes it even cuter is friends have told me the only place romance and relationships are really allowed to blossom is in uni so this truly is is moment and i could feel the elation coming from him   i know this will have been private but just seeing his pure  unfiltered joy has infected me and really made my days happier since it happened  it was so genuine as desperately single as i am i cant even be jealous   whoever you are random chinese boy i sincerely hope the rest of your days are just as beautiful as this moment    ,0

my  yo  daughter just asked me if i knew what a human centipede is  i hesitantly said no and asked her  she said its from a book she was reading where the kids tie each others shoe laces together and try to walk  one kid falls and hurts their pinky finger so a slightly less graphic thriller of a story than the movie  ,0
my son saw a sign that said please keep children under supervision and asked  dad  have you got super vision    i never thought of the word supervision that way before  even though its probably just a derivative of the word supervise  my sons innocent question made me think of it a different way  dont just keep your kids under your vision  keep them under super vision  ,0
the perk of being an adult is doing your own grocery shopping  today i bought a green tea scented dishwashing liquid and i am very happy  sure  you have to pay your own bills but think of all the stuff you always wanted as a kid but your parents weren t interested  now you can buy them all   well  almost   as a kid  i always followed my parents to the supermarket  i was fascinated by those fancy scented cleaning products  cherry blossom detergent  heck yes  unfortunately my parents always stick to what they use and like  my mom has always been in charge of groceries so for    years of my life  our house used the same lemon scented dishwashing liquid  it s good  but i got tired of it   i moved out when i was     adult kids living with parents is perfectly normal in my culture just to clarify   for   years that i ve done my own grocery shopping  i never buy lemon dishwashing liquid  my staples are orange and strawberry   so today i went to the store and spotted a new product sitting next to my mom s favorite lemon  it s the same brand but with green tea scent  i love green tea  i put it in my basket  paid  and head home  there is a coffee mug waiting to be cleaned  oh  my  god  it smells sooooo nice     year old me would be happy to learn that now i can buy my own dishwashing liquid in any scents i want   thank you for coming to my ted talk    edit  and thank you  a kind stranger for the neat award xd ,0
i complimented a lonely girl  and it had an effect this was some time ago  in my school  theres this girl that usually sits by herself  shes either drawing on her tablet in a corner or reading a book  she doesnt put much mind into what shes wearing i assume  because she would always come in the same sweater and pants  i might be wrong  but one day  she came to school with this gorgeous black long sleeved blouse  that had holes revealing her shoulders  ive never seen her with this kind of clothing so it was definetly new     x   b   i dont usually have any problem with telling people what i think  or to go up to strangers to say something  so i went up to her and told her that i liked her clothing today and that it fit her  she responded with a small smile   because she doesnt really talk much  but that was ok  i told her what i thought and i was satisfied   but then  during the coming weeks  i noticed something different  she would start to come in different clothing  and she would also wear that long sleeved blouse more often as well  it made me really happy to see that a small compliment could really change someone so much    x   b   people dont get enough compliments  especially not people that put down thought into how they look  or their crafting     x   b   have you ever complimented someone and noticed some kind of change      edit  wow this blew up   and a silver too    its been such a nice evening reading your comments and stories guys  really made my weekend        give a compliment to a significant other tomorrow  or call your grandparents parents  they will definetly appreciate that for a long time    ,0
my husband made a lovely post and it made its way to me you know how sometimes you scroll through a social media and you see a cute post  in your head you say thats so cute i wish my significant other said things like that  or did stuff like that  well this time i saw that post and it was for me  i could tell within the first few sentences it was him   i felt my heart melt  and this post in itself meant the world to me  some of you might say so what its just a post but heres a little background  we have been married   years and we have a   year old and a   year old  needless to say things have been hard  we been stressed by life and it has affected the way we treat each other  so to others this might not mean much but to me it means the world  because he means the world to me  as crazy as this man makes me he also is the best part of me  there is no better husband or father to my children than this man  yes we all have things we need to work on but i see more than what he currently is  i see the man he could become  i see the good in him even when he thinks he has none  ,0
i just received the most amazing christmas miracle a special needs boy who looked a little older than me  i m     came up to me in the store parking lot asking how my christmas was  i was in a hurry  and a bad mood because of family issues  but i already saw   people ignore him and i just couldn t do that i wouldn t have any way  so i stood and talked with him for a few minutes  he asked how my christmas was and if it went good and i said yes and he said  are you sure  i think it could be better for you  and i laughed and said i guess it could always be better lol  he then gave me the biggest hug i ve ever had and said  hold on wait right here  i have something for you  and he ran to his parents  maybe grandparents  car and came back with a bag full of candy  i was super excited  it tickled me pink  and gave me an even bigger hug and said merry christmas told me i looked really beautiful and that i was his  christmas angel   i almost cried there  and left he waved at me from the window the whole time too  so i left and i got to looking in the bag and it was coincidentally full of my favorite candy and at the very bottom was a christmas card that said  if you received this  you deserve it  merry christmas from the      family  and it had     in it with a note that said  spend this on yourself  everyone deserves a special treat sometimes  thank you for being a kind person  jesus loves you and so do we    that just blew me away  i was at the store putting my last    in gas so i could get to my aunts house for christmas dinner later  i don t need anything  but it was still just an amazing gesture that helped me more than they will ever know  not necessarily the money but i just needed that act of kindness  it made me cry the whole way home  he was literally the sweetest person i ever met and gave literally the best hugs ever  i really wish i could see him again  but i saw they had out of state tags on their vehicle so i probably won t  but i m just over filled with joy right now  i can t get over how great that hug felt  it was like he knew me for years  and him calling me his  christmas angel  tops the cake  that just put the most warmth in my heart  i wish i could tell him  no  you re my christmas angel   ,0

i cooked a real meal last night for the first time in my life  im    years old and last night was the first time i ever actually followed a recipe and made a real meal  my whole life i always just heat up premade frozen food  or just boil some noodles and throw some sauce on them    i got inspired by my cousin who is really into cooking to try it out myself  so i found a recipe that looked good  went to the store and bought the ingredients  and came home and made it    i ended up making some vegan bbq pulled jackfruit sandwiches with baked sweet potatoes and cole slaw  and then for dessert i made some vegan brownies from scratch  it felt extremely rewarding and i really enjoyed it  i had a smile on my face the whole time i was in the kitchen   i feel dumb for never doing this before but im glad i gave it a try and loved it  my fiancee and daughter thought it was great and it helped us all have a better night  ,0
you men sure get unnerved when you see a woman cry  i m used to my husband getting anxious when i cry  but this was a new one to me  i was at work when i received a very upsetting phone call about my mom s health  everyone in the office heard it  and everyone knew i was crying  so a male coworker came over and very reverently was like   you can have this  i hope it cheers you up a bit   i look up    and he s handing me a package of colored pens    i think it was a very serious and sincere attempt  but it actually worked in that i almost started cracking up  it was so out of place and yet so genuine and i think i will now always remember this whenever i think about my mom s condition  almost to the point that i m entertaining her obituary saying   in lieu of flowers please bring colored pens    edit  i love hearing all the similar stories of the oddball items others have received from others trying to help  and for any of you currently going through difficult times  my thoughts and colored pens are with you    ,0

my university just gave me a full ride scholarship and retroactively absorbed older fees in      my parents broke the harsh reality that they could not afford to send me to college  after i had already applied and was accepted to various institutions   while i knew that we were not in the best financial position  and i had worked near full time throughout high school to try to compensate  i did not know just how bad it was  although i am grateful that they tried so hard to hide how truly abysmal our financial situation was so that i could have a good childhood  waiting so long to tell me the truth left me without enough time time to fill out the proper financial assistance forms  search for the correct   best scholarships  and apply to universities with a history of good financial packages  as a result  i went to community college  which was a blessing in disguise and the best thing that has ever happened to me  but at the time it felt soul crushing for someone who had done very well in high school and lived in a town full of stigmas   fast forward to       i was able to transfer to a good school with a reputation for good financial aid packages  after a long year of submitting an ungodly amount of forms to the financial aid office and being denied registration for next semester  i was just offered a      scholarship and my old fees were actually absorbed  and i was allowed to register and not forced to drop out haha   my tuition payment account currently has a balance in the negatives      edit    obligatory wow  i was not expecting this much attention  thank you guys so much for the kind words  screw the community college stigma and fight on   edit    i just submitted a final paper for one of my classes and came back to see silver    what a day     edit    gold    this is the best finals week ever    thank you all so much   ,0

japanese toilets should be a basic human right after just having experienced what it feels like to have your butt be treated like a god i can never go back to my old peasant ways   i apologize for probably being too graphic   imagine   it s    degrees outside and you just urgently ran home having to take your well deserved dump after a long day of work  you jump onto the toilet only to be horribly greeted by a seat that feels like ice  shuddering and trying to survive the cold  it s feels like a punishment having to take a dump rather than an achievement   but never again  your best friend toilet san is there for you  the seat warmed up and clean and he s been waiting all day for nothing but your business  control the heat and set it to whatever you desire or just time it so that it perfectly heats up at the same time everyday you re coming home    imagine    you re sitting there  browsing reddit  enjoying your business and overall just taking your time  relaxing  but then you realize  you took way to long  your legs are already feeling weird and itchy and now wiping this away is going to be such a pain  you mentally already prepare yourself for   minutes of constantly taking out many new layers of toilet paper  folding them up  unwillingly trying to perfectly clean up every single bit and just sitting there in disgust for what feels like an eternity   but not anymore  no longer do you have to use super thin and crappy toilet paper and wipe forever only so your fingers reek terribly and your butt itches for the rest of the day  toilet san is there for you  he gently and accurately sprays water onto your butt however strong or light you prefer  guaranteed to remove all and everything you don t want being there without you even having to move a finger  you can casually continue browsing reddit reading a newspaper or doing whatever your heart desires all while toilet san is taking care of the less pleasing things in the bathroom  just lean back and let yourself be treated   never again do you have to waste millions of layers of toilet paper  calculating how much you can actually use until the toilet is gonna clog up and you ll be stuck trying to clean it up forever only to eventually give up  paying unholy amounts to your local plumber and regretting every single bit of your last bathroom visit  but no dirty messes anymore  toilet san does everything for you  carefully prevents waste of toilet paper  because you don t even really need any in the first place and lightly flushing if you do end up using some anyway while probably saving you hundreds of dollars in the meantime    and even if you had a bad day and sometimes just feel a bit lonely  toilet san has your back  he  talks to you  asking for what it is you desire  trying to make even the worst of your days a bit more bearable for you  at least in the bathroom    toilet san is my hero and i regret having spent so many years of my life in darkness  not realizing his beauty  i cannot understand how we are living in      and this is not an international standard yet   but now i know and so should you    edit  as some people requested  here is a link to my baby   https   imgur com  z rjyc   edit   i want to thank the kind stranger for the silver but also wanna mention the odd similarities between the silver symbol and toilet san   ,0

does anyone else think that social media is helping to fuel a narcissistic and materialistic world  so im aware that this is not an original thought but it has been on my mind lately and wanted to get some feedback and opinions from others  since last week i decided to stay off of facebook  my only social media account other than reddit  because i felt like it was messing with my mental state  for years i would just scroll through and compare myself and my life to others that i saw on facebook  it seemed like everyone was always doing great things or going on a fun vacation but the reality is that people only post what they want you to see  if you constantly compare yourself and your life to others then you will never truly be happy and it seems like nowadays everyone just cares about themselves and what they own and real joy comes from none of that  seems like so many people are trying to be the best looking  the most popular  have the most amount of money and power but the truth is most people never achieve any of that and even if you do  you always want more or once you get comfortable used to having those things you go back to feeling how you were before you had those things  to me it just feels like the world has forgotten how to be thankful for what they do have and how to be compassionate and kind to others which is where i think true happiness comes from  ive been dealing with negative feelings lately which made me start thinking about why i was feeling the way i was and this is apart of the conclusion i came to  just felt like venting a little and having a casual conversation with some of you redditors  would enjoy to hear some of your thoughts on the topic     x   b   edit  i appreciate all of the upvotes and comments  i will read them all tonight after work    ,0

had my first corona related racism incident today i am asian american btw  although i think that goes without saying with the title   i was shopping for some food and some guy forced his daughter away from me   he also asked me to move away from him in the line for the cashier   i had no issue with this because we should be practicing social distancing and i was standing a little close to him   however  there was something wrong with the register so a white employee steps in between us   he got very close to the guy and he didnt say anything or take a step back   he also told the cashier to hurry up because he didnt want to get infected  while staring straight at me   i was so embarrassed in this situation  but luckily his daughter did too   at least she was raised right   edit  this got way more attention than i expected   yes  it was an objectively terrible thing to go through  but there are ways to counteract such negativity in the world   be kind to one another and if someone seems to be having a rough day  stand up for them of simply make them feel seen   in a world of chaos the little things mean so much more   have a nice day  ,0
while everyone on reddit can be considered a redditor  on other platforms like instagram  youtube  tiktok  etc  you have to either make money out of it or have a lot of followers to be an instagrammer  youtuber or tiktoker    i love how no one is  famous  or  an influencer  on reddit  its just people talking and individual posts getting recognition  no post is upvoted because of the person behind it       while reddit can be a little problematic sometimes  it feels more genuine than any other social media platform in my opinion  love that    ,0
working from home is illuminating a pretty unhealthy work environment i know a lot of people dont have the luxury of a stable job right now that allows them to work from home  i dont want to compare myself or diminish their situation in any way   my current  desk  is a kitchen table perched in front of a corner window  i havent turned on my music today because im loving the sound of the birds singing outside  im two steps from the refrigerator and still down   pounds without even trying  without the barrage of office treats and leftovers  lunches out  and the need to eat my feelings because im stuck in a cubicle surrounded by gray walls  im somehow in better shape than i was before my gym closed  im so productive without all the interruptions  my partner and i have been able to stay on top of all the chores and have more time to cook healthy meals  sure  i occasionally miss my coworkers but im beginning to dread the day i have to go back for good  ,0

big thank you to that person in the gym in the last two weeks ive started going to the gym every other day after work  sometimes ill pop in on a saturday  when you start going around the same time consistently  you start seeing the same people pretty regularly   im a pretty overweight and out of shape guy  so i had that feeling the first few times of  everybody is looking at me   and feeling intimidated because all these other people are in real good shape    my second time at the gym this guy walks by and stops  comes back as im resting between sets and shakes my hand  introduces himself  i introduce myself  he says  youre doing great  keep going   taps my arm and leaves the area   ive seen him every time i go to the gym during the week after work and noticed hes very friendly with the majority of the people in there  always encouraging you if you walk by him   youre doing great  great     i just wanted to give a shoutout and thanks to the people in their gym who supports people  who gives them encouragement and reaches out to make people more comfortable   ,0
i just called my grandma and when she answered the first thing she said was   well isnt this my lucky week    i realized thatd id been subconsciously  scheduling  calls with her   calling her regularly about once a week   but i had some extra time today and i called even though i just talked to her   days ago    i feel kinda like an asshole  im going to start calling her more    also  can someone please comment on the morality of the following  her memory is going and she carries a little notebook around with her to stay organized and is actually coping fantastically well considering her limitations because she is so well organized and cognizant of what her limitations are  so anyway she doesnt really remember if she paid the electric bill or not this month but she does remember where she wrote it down so shell check if shes worried and thats that  anyway sometimes when were talking shell start to tell me a story shes already told me and shell say  did i already tell you this story      for example shell be telling me  these details are fake  about the time her and my grandpa lived in idaho and the fight he got into with a circus performer   and shell stop and go  did i already tell you this story    and while she leads actually a surprisingly active lifestyle she still doesnt have       minutes of stuff to tell me  x  x a week so i lie like a dog and say  youve told me stories about you and grandpa living in idaho but im not sure i remember this one about the circus performer  go on    because i dont want to gas light my poor grandma whose memory is going    but clearly she has some inkling that she might have told me this story before so i try to assuage her fears of boring me without also  well  gaslighting her    ,0

i have an important hypothetical question for you all   ,0
i upvote benign comments sitting at   or lower such as  lmao  that usually get downvoted so what a guy laughed at something  or they had a stupid question  or they misinterpreted the post  why do people need to downvote just because of that  let it sit at   people  dont push someone down just because they arent following reddiquette       ignore the post  explain whats happening  and clarify the posts meaning  i see so many people sitting at   or lower because they just made a comment that wasnt some astute observation  funny one liner  or deep explanation  some people on here are from different countries  some people suck at communicating through text  and some people just arent that bright   and you know what  that last one irks me a lot  people are dumb  were all really  really stupid at points in our lives  sure you may be smarter than me  but im smarter than him  and that other guy is smarter than you  so does it really matter if someone said something stupid  like in the grand scheme of things  does it matter  no  not really  so why mass downvote people  why make them feel bad and make snarky comments over a question  enlighten them  that way instead of having   stupid person who feels bad  you now have   slightly less stupid person who feels good  it just makes sense to me       x   b   edit  i just wanted to say this got so much more of a response then i ever thought it would  i also want to say    thank you everyone in this thread  i have seen nothing but positivity and empathy from people and its given me such a new perspective  some silent  awesome majority of people i never knew existed are all talking to me and sharing their thoughts  i think its wonderful and its made me very happy to interact with each and every one of you  ,0

psa  there is an important difference between disinfecting and sanitizing  with covid    cases continuing to increase and the necessity of keeping things clean so that we can all be protected  i think its important that everyone understand the difference between disinfecting and sanitizing  i see people using disposable wipes in the grocery store aisles and on shopping carts and such but cleaning those surfaces in a way that provides very little actual protection   in the us  a sanitizer is a product that kills       of bacteria within    seconds  this can have some effect on viruses and fungus as well depending on the product  but its effectiveness isnt assured for     those so check if a claim is made on the label  things like hand sanitizer are fairly effective when used correctly    in the us  a disinfectant kills      of the organisms it is designed for within    minutes  most over the counter are general purpose and cover bacteria  viruses  and fungus but they take longer to work  for example  the popular and out of stock almost everywhere clorox disinfecting wipes kill       of bacteria and viruses with specific types listed  the cdc states that most epa registered bleach or      alcohol based household cleaning products should be effective when used correctly  the big thing here is that products like clorox wipes require the surface to be covered and wet for at least   minutes before wiping away   the big take away is that sanitizers are fast killers but less effective  and disinfectants require time to be effective  if you see someone wiping down a cart with a wipe and then immediately wiping the solution away with a paper towel  they havent protected against anything  same goes for the cashiers cleaning the checkout stands and so forth  disinfectants take anywhere from   to    minutes to be fully effective  and most seem to be around     washing your hands properly is the best way to keep yourself and your family safe after coming in contact with surfaces that you arent sure if they are clean  this includes groceries that you brought home from the store or picking up the mail    if you cant find anything else and you want to be safe and disinfect the surfaces of your home  you can make your own solution with an alcohol concentration of at least      or     proof  bleach solutions are certainly effective as well  just follow the directions on the label  it doesnt take much as long as the bleach is fresh  bleach on the shelf degrades after   months  losing about     per year   stay safe  stay home  stay vigilant  ,0

in    minutes i will meet my sister again who i last saw when i was   years old  im    now  our family is full of drama  all the time  eventually it apparently got to her  and she broke all ties to my mother  and the rest of the family to avoid meeting her again  yesterday after   years she texted me again to meet up and clear things up    i dont even know how to handle this   edit  since people asked for an update  here goes nothing  and by the way  she is      we greeted each other with a hug  and she went on by offering to go grab some food at a pizzeria nearby  where we could sit down and talk   most of the food remained on the plates since we talked a lot about why she came to the decision that staying at home and talking to our mother just wasnt an option for her anymore  and her life is much less stressful than it was ever before when she still had contact with our mother  she also cleared up a few things that my mother has been falsely accusing her of   against my will she paid for my food and we left  just chatting and asking questions about how life has been going for the other one  she drove me home after that and offered me her help a couple times  should the family ever turn on me the way they did it to her  i saved her number under a false name on my phone should my mother ever get suspicious and go through it  got out of the car  gave her one final hug and walked home   great sister and great human  sadly with a horrible youth  ,0

came out as bisexual today       err  so i dont really know if i really needed to because i always acted a little flamboyant and such  but ive been in a hetero marriage for    years now so people just assumed i was straight and thats it    we quarantine has given my wife and i a lot of time to do self exploration and just figuring stuff out a out ourselves  i think i was finally able to come to terms with that fact that i am bisexual  i think i always knew but this little extra boost helped me come to terms    being a very powerful pride month this year  i also felt extra support and desire to come out during a special time   so i did what any other reasonable    year old would do  i shared it on my instagram and twitter    if you knew me and how i am with social media  youll know that this is the fitting medium for me to get news out   anyway  i dont know why i am sharing this because its not the most triumphant story   but hey here i am  i am bisexual  nice to meet you all    edit  this blew up far more than i thought it would  i am having trouble keeping up with the replies  so if i miss anyone i am so sorry  just know all the love and support means so much  thanks for all the reference and lemon bars         also  this keeps getting asked so     my wife came out as pansexual last pride so me coming out was easily accepted and encouraged  she k super supportive  we have began to open up our marriage a little bit to explore these new identities they we embrace  we are having a great time and we still love each other very much    ,0

my girlfriend and i accidentally started dating  just thought this was kinda funny  she is from ukraine  so her english isnt perfect  but its pretty good  we met on tinder and went on a couple dates  we basically had this conversation     her   do you want to date with me      me   you mean do i want to date you      her   yeah   and i said yes   i thought it was kinda soon  i hadnt planned on asking her out for a little while  but i said yes anyway because thats where it felt like it was going  it seemed kinda silly to me to artificially say  no  when i had already planned on asking her at some point anyway  the next morning i updated my facebook relationship status  because you know  life revolves around facebook  and she accepted it    well  turns out she wasnt asking me to be her boyfriend  she was just asking if i wanted to continue going on dates with her  she had met some previous guys on tinder that ghosted her so she was just asking if i wanted to continue hanging out  basically    while i had thought that she asked  me  out  she thought i had asked  her  out in a really lame way by updating my facebook relationship status  but said didnt think much of it and just rolled with it  shes pretty laid back  thats one of the reasons that i like her    i didnt find out this miscommunication for a while but now that i know  its kind of embarrassing  either way  we both just laughed at it  and now were dating so thats pretty cool  ,0

someone found our camp    around   years ago me and my friends were messing around down in our local woods  we stumbled across this old abandoned a framed shelter that was clearly expertly done  fixed together with zipties  had an old roasting spit above the fire place and even a stump sawn flat that formed a movable table   over the following   years we repaired and upgraded it untill it had ex military tents covering it for waterproofing  complete camoflage in the form of growing ferns on it and other things and even a fully clay fired pizza oven we made from scavanged stones and clay from the river  weve camped in there in thunderstorms  eaten some of the best food of my life down there and made memories that i will never forget   then one day it was gone  someone had come in and trashed the entire place  we were upset and angry but decided not to let it stop us and rebuild it somewhere new where they wouldnt find it  so after several weeks of searching we found a place  not as good as the old one but still  not bad  we dug the ground up  started building stone walls to make it harder to break down and transferred important materials from the old camp to the new one   however life caught up with us and we never finished  i went to uni  my friends got apprenticeships and other good jobs  we met our life parterners  moved away and one of us even has a baby on the way   then a couple of weeks ago while visiting my parents i decided to show my partner what we used to do and see if it was still standing  it was  and it had been repaired and upgraded  i asked my friends if it were them  they both said no and had no idea who it was  someone out there stumbled on an abandoned shelter that was clearly expertly done     im going to leave them a note with some old photos and a bit of history explaining how theyre continuing a passion and pastime that has been going on in these woods for over half a decade at least  probably more  if youre reading this then enjoy your secret place and thank you for continuing our tradition  we hope it brings you as much joy and memories as it did us   yours sincerly  the village idiots  mighty mouse  the munchie kid and elcorto  edit  photos the old camp https   imgur com gallery h qajqy sadly more modern photos were corrputed  this wasnt its final form the new camp  currently in progress https   imgur com gallery wfwlqar ,0
i interrupted and berated a bully on the bus today  and i feel pretty good about it  im a senior  in highschool  and on my bus home theres always little kids too  you know what they do during the winter  stealing hats and throwing them away  pushing snow into unsuspecting faces and so on  most of the time its harmless really but what happened today definitely crossed the line  so they were all kind off playing around taking each others hats and so on  i was just minding my own business  but then they kind of started targeting a single one and getting more straightforward  i was already kind of alerted and honestly ready to step in as soon as the situation escalates which happened shortly after  the boy needed to get off the bus but he still needed his hat so he grabbed for it and apparently scratched the other boys hand or something so he pushed the boy to the ground which could have ended really badly  the fallen boy was obviously and visibly upset and when he went for his backpack the asshole boy wouldnt let go even after the bus had opened the doors  thats when i stepped in and i kid you not  the bully shat his damn pants  he was so scared and i was really mad because i could relate with the boy who was being bullied  i asked the group if they felt cool and specifically said to the bully boy that he should feel ashamed and that he was definitely not cool  he turned completely red and didnt say a word for the rest of the ride  it felt good  i could feel the adrenaline rush because its hard for me to stand up to bullies  even if theyre younger and not my bullies but still  thanks lol edit  thank you so much for the medals  first reddit silver  gold and plat  ,0

i m so lucky my son turns   in a few weeks and has been asking for a nintendo switch but at around      i just couldn t justify it whilst already paying out      for him to take all his friends to a water park   yesterday a colleague pointed out that a nintendo switch was the top prize in a raffle in work so i bought a ticket and have only gone and won it  he is going to be over the moon and i don t have to cheap out on his party now  i m so happy    edit  just a little update    we were in a shop today so i casually walked past the switches and he looked at one and gave a big longing sigh  i came really close to giving him it early  not sure if my will power will last until september   ,0
a small insight into another culture  i was just biking on my way to the barbershop  when i was pulled aside by a jewish man coming out of a synagoge  he asked me to help him to fix a technical issue inside of the synagogue  because it is saturday today  he himself couldnt do it because of the sabbat   so i went inside to help him with it  but when i entered it  i felt really lucky and even somewhat honored to have a small insight into such a different culture  i could see a lot of things that i normally wouldnt be able to see  since in my town  the hasidic jews have a very closed community   i think it is great that cultures can be so different and we can still help and respect eachother  especially in this century where polarisation is such a big issue  i felt very humbled to have this man trust me and let me enter the synagogue  he even gave me some cake afterwards as a reward   i know it sounds stupid  but these small intercultural interactions give me a lot of hope to build further towards an equal society where every culture  man and woman  get the respect they deserve   has anyone else felt the same  or experienced something alike   edit  wow  it is great to see so much great reactions and stories  this happened in antwerp  belgium btw    ps  thank you for the gold and platinum kind strangers  ,0
nobody gives a shit about you at the gym  don t fear like you re an outsider of some club  when i first started going to the gym  i was     lbs  i was scrawny  and weak  and i was so ashamed of what my bench would look like  or how much i was curling  the first few weeks started to feel so uncomfortable  but every week  i would start lifting more weight  my body weight increased  and i was seeing changes  i knew i must have been doing something right  so i didn t feel as out of place    i have had a few people come up to me and offer advice  like  what grip i should use for a certain pull  or stance position techniques  i have never had a single person make a negative remark  not just to me but everyone    years go by and i hit     lbs  i looked drastically different and now i wasn t the scrawny kid learning it  and i see the same people i used to be every year  people that are so worried what others may think  and nobody cares  well  nobody cares in a negative way    there is an exception  everywhere has maybe     people who think they are the king of the gym  and scoff if you ask to use one of their   pairs of dumbbells they have hoarded around their flat bench  fuck those people  and everyone at the gym hates them  they are so full of their own protein filled shit that they judge everyone around them  so as long as you remind yourself that everyone else hates them and their opinion of anyone doesn t mean squat  it ll be easier         was one of the worst years of my life  and i know it s been a shit year for a lot of others  so make      yours  if your goal is to lose weight or gain muscle  it s your year  don t be scared of the gym  make it yours   ,0

ive been working on my horrible fashion sense for years  and today i got complimented on it  to give some background  my fashion sense was absolutely horrifying about   years back  im talking neon green t shirt poking under a dingy red hoodie that was a size too small with hot pink shoelaces and unflattering jeans  my entire life up to that point was  well    i just want to be comfortable  who gives a toot about fashion        until i realized that dressing nicely was amazing medicine for my low self esteem  and that i loved looking good    but what i didnt realize was that you cant just go from   to     if youve been completely ignoring fashion your entire life  i had no idea what looked good  what went together  or what was in style  so  for the next few years  i did intense people watching and made mental notes to myself of what outfits and combinations i liked  the more people i observed  the more i realized how high the bar for womens fashion was  and felt wholly inadequate  i dont think theres been a single day in the past six years where i thought i was even average   today  i was walking with some friends back to our apartment when one of them said   klarrynet youre so fashionable  you pull off a lot of outfits that i think are super cute that i wish i could try   i laughed and told her thanks  and that thats the first time ive heard that in my entire life  afterwards  i was so giddy that i texted one of my closer friends about what happened  and he said   well yeah  ive thought that for a while lol   i think this might be one of the most meaningful compliments i have received in my entire time in college  because its been something ive both been extremely self conscious about  and something ive actively been putting in a lot of effort into for a very long time  ,0
twelve years ago today  when i was     i joined reddit  im    now  george w bush was still president  i had  a year or two before  met the man with whom i would have a painful   year marriage  i was still profoundly sick as i had been since early puberty with a serious  rare iillness that hadnt been diagnosed yet  i had not yet made a single piece of jewelry  ive now been a silversmith for   years and made thousands   most of those intervening years between my first day here and today were terribly difficult  i was very ill and mostly homebound  as i had been for so long i remained an anxious  frightened  isolated person    in      i married and then chose for   years to stay married to a man whose unwillingness to compromise  cruelty to me especially when i was ill  and hundreds of days of complete cold shouldering were absolute and unyielding  ive looked back many times since and have never totally understood why i stayed so long   a year after i joined reddit the iphone was first released   ln      i received a diagnosis for my rare disorder and in      a doctor found the treatment regimen that began to give me more of a normal life than i had imagined i would ever have  i became less anxious and less isolated as i grew strong enough to gain independence   in      the final harry potter film was released and osama bin laden was killed   in      i divorced my first husband  the most emotionally painful thing i have ever experienced  my life as id known it was in every way demolished and i had to begin again   when i was    i had spent most of my life very ill and most of my adult life in a painful relationship that ended in a lonely  impoverished  dismantled existance  despite that i had found great joy in silversmithing  which i began learning in       i was never well enough to turn it into a real career  and i would never be a mother  something i badly wanted to experience   i was tired  and it felt as if i was probably fated to a permanently difficult life  i found it hard to imagine being able to make it through decades more of the emotional and physical suffering i had experienced already   in      i met an endlessly kind  deeply affectionate  smart  goofy man and we quickly became infatuated  he quieted his own demons with alcohol and some drugs  the major source of stress between us   still  i moved away from my hometown for the first time  with him  i never had thought id be able to live away from my parents who had often had to care for me into my   s   my world expanded  i traveled by plane and to a new state for the first time since childhood  i rode a horse  i learned to sit with the dying  and became certified as an end of life doula  a lifelong northerner  i was surprised to come to adore my new southern city   barack obama completed two presidential terms between my joining reddit and now   my boyfriends drug use became too serious for me to handle and we broke up even though his kindness towards me had never once wavered  that night knew i would be alone  it figured that i had done a terrible job at choosing a partner again and it seemed natural my life would come to ruins again  i was certain i would move home to care for my parents as they aged  live in relative solitude and never be a mother   he changed his mind    hours later and joined a rehab and therapy program  it was like a switch was flipped   it seemed he had become a man overnight   in      the cubs won the world series and donald trump won the presidency   over the last    years  after a desperately lonely childhood and early adulthood  i finally found incredible  wise  fascinating women friends   in      my husband and i were married in a beautiful  intimate  sunny backyard wedding  joined by the people we loved most   in january of      our adopted infant son was placed in our arms for the first time   i still do not have a real career  i will never be entirely free of the symptoms of my genetic disease  which i chose not to pass to a child    we arent wealthy and our child still doesnt sleep through the night  there will be hard times ahead i know  and yet the last two years have been the most joyful  loving  unexpected  affectionate  magical years of my life  i never  absolutely never  thought i would experience sustained  rich happiness such as i have these years  i love my spouse and his unending affection  i love my beautiful son infinitely  i love my simple life   that is what    years looks like  ,0
i never realised people pay it forwards in real life  today a stranger paid for my cancer head shave i have lymphoma  i also am a girl in my early twenties  and all my life my long dark hair has been my most identifying feature  i have been distraught at the prospect of losing my hair  more so than actually having cancer   since my hair has always been very very long and thick  as most girls do ive struggled with hating my appearance  and my hair was something that was always easy to maintain and love  and often the only thing i ever liked about myself  it was so easy to hide behind  and became my security blanket  so what if i felt or looked awful  my hair was beautiful and people would notice that before they noticed my perceived flaws   anyway  i had my hair cut to about shoulder lengtj  but it was matting into dreadlocks and falling out on massive clumps  i went to the local barbers and asked for a haircut  the first few places turned me down as they only cut mens hair  yeah but i want a mens haircut  i felt pretty flustered at this point  as this horrible experience was already becoming more awkward and difficult than necessary  but managed to find a third barber shop   there was a customer getting his hair cut by a barber  and a different barber waiting by reception  the free barber asked why i wanted to cut my beautiful hair  and i awkwardly stammered out that i had cancer and pointed to the bald patches that were forming  he was very kind and helped recommend lengths that would best hide the bald patches and asked me about my treatment and how i found out i was ill  and i told him    the other customer was paying and he said he would like to pay for my haircut  as he couldnt help over hearing my conversation with the barber  and he hoped i got better soon  he said his daughter was around my age and also had long hair which she loved  it was so unexpected and generous it moved me to tears  i was so surprised and grateful  the barbers also recommended some pomade to help style my short hair and refused payment for the pomade  and told me to come back if i needed another cut  i left and cried in my car for about ten minutes  ive been struggling a lot with the whole cancer thing  and the generosity and kindness of these strangers really touched me and made me feel seen and valued    i am not in the us  and have always associated paying it forwards  with americans paying for other peoples coffees in starbucks  as a non coffee drinker ive never really thought about it but the sheer simple kindness had really cheered me up a lot  i will definitely try to be more aware of ways i can make a positive difference to strangers in the future      tldr   i am   f and have an almost unhealthy reliance on my long hair  i need it cut off due to chemo and it falling out in clumps which is distressing  a stranger over heard me talk about my cancer and paid for my haircut  and the barber was very kind and did not charge me for some pomade  ,0
today is my   th anniversary of quitting smoking ten years ago today i smoked my last cigarette   i was at work and i asked my coworker for a cigarette   he gave me one and i pointed at the clock and said  it s  pm now this is my last one    i never looked back   i even inspired my coworker into quitting   edit  wow  i am absolutely blown away from all your thoughtful comments   i commend those who expressed that they are just starting to quit   quitting is hard especially with all the stress and pressure we come across in our daily lives   i feel as each milestone we reach in our journey should be celebrated in some way   yesterday i went on a nice hike with my daughter to celebrate     thank you all for your kind words and support  ,0
coffee noob here  just had an embarrassing realization  so i recently started college  prior to the start of the semester  i had never tried coffee  i thought i should give it a chance and have been trying several types to try to find something i like   almost all the types i tried were disgusting  it tasted nothing like it smelled  making me think that perhaps i was fighting a losing battle  then i discovered the coffee they were serving at the cafeteria   when i first tasted it   i was in heaven  this wasnt the bitter  gag inducing liquid i had been forcing myself to gulp down  in fact  it hardly tasted like coffee at all  i knew this creamy drink lay on the pansy end of the spectrum  but i saw it as my gateway drug into the world of coffee drinkers   i tried to look up the nutrition information so i could be aware and better control my portions  it was labelled as french vanilla supreme on the machine  but i could only find creamer of that name  i figured that was just the name the school decided to give it    i was just sitting down thinking about all the things that didnt add up  its taste and consistency  the fact that it didnt give me a caffeine buzz  the fact it was served in a different machine than the other coffee and wasnt even labelled as coffee  all this lead to my epiphany    that i havent been drinking coffee at all  ive been drinking     cups of creamer a day  i feel like an idiot    tl dr  tried to get into coffee  ended up drinking a shit ton of creamer ,0
ive decided to stop smoking weed permanently  i used to smoke weed occasionally back in uni but nowadays ive become a heavy user of the drug  ive decided to quit permanently and this decision came as a result of armed robbers breaking into my room with guns and i cant help but think it was because i was stoned that night that was why i wasnt conscious that they had been in two other neighbours room prior  they broke down the door to my own flat  and i still wasnt aware until they got into my room  and that was the point where i woke  barely aware of what was going on  i still thought it was a dream    its been a good one week and i  havent touched weed since then  my anxiety is over the roof but ive vowed never to use a device again   edit  i see a lot of weed smokers coming for me  guys i never said weed caused the robbery  i said if i was sober  i wouldnt have slept like a dead person and not hear my neighbours screaming  i take weed to help me sleep and that night i was in a deep sleep when the incident occurred  get it now  im only quitting to stay mentally alert   thanks to those with kind words  ,0

anyone else randomly lose their sense of reality  i find myself overthinking a simple subject until i cannot comprehend the subject anymore  the best way i can really describe it is through an example    earlier today i was having a normal conversation with my so  significant other  about what we wanted to eat today  very normal conversation  but after she had walked off i started wondering what that conversation was like in her head  what do i look like to her  what is the first thing she looks at when she turns to me  the thought of seeing myself outside my body as if i was another person just made me forget reality for just that second  other examples include technology and other variants of that  i sit here trying to understand the process of how voices and instruments can go from being played live  to a carved disk and a needle  to a link i clicked on   man it makes me trip out and i just don t feel real if i think on it too long      i think this might be related to staring at a word for so long it looks fake    anyway  how do you guys lose your sense of reality      edit  is this when i say i didn t expect expect for this to take off like it did  wow  there are so many responses and i unfortunately only got to a couple when i had originally posted this  i may have fallen asleep  and i must say i m so excited to go through your comments    i ve seen about a quarter of the comments referring to this as derealization or depersonalization     https   en wikipedia org wiki derealization  https   en wikipedia org wiki depersonalization  and i just want to thank everyone who did bring that to my attention  i had no idea so many people have gone through the same thing  i ve seen some comments referring to a point in their life where this was happening frequently but has changed over a period of time  it s definitely amazing to see how different but similar your experiences are    thank you all so much for contributing   ,0

my grandma recognized me today last year my only living grandma fell and broke her leg  after surgery she fell ill and was never able to make a full recovery and it took its toll on her mind  escalating the situation from a  simple broken leg  to a full set of senile dementia   since she climbed on that bed after surgery she never was able to sit anymore  which means that shes confined on her own bedroom  since im her neighbor im always on her house talking to her  but shes delusional every day and do not recognize us anymore  she always refer to me or my mother as other people from the past that her mind makes her remember   but today was different   i entered her bedroom to visit her as usual and  for the first time  she looked at me and smiled as if saying  i know who you are   i decided to ask her if she knew who i was and the answer was  yes  youre my grandson  and she said my name  for the first time it felt as if i had my grandma brought back to me again and we chatted for a couple hours  we talked about life and about our past together  she talked how she was proud of me  that i became a fine young man and that she hoped to see me achieve success in life  she even complimented me for letting my hair grow   when i was leaving  as i waved her goodbye  she looked at me and said  please come visit me again so we can talk more  and it broke me inside knowing that she may not remember me at all tomorrow but it doesnt matter  i promised her that  as she took care of me when i was young  ill take care of her and be with her until the end   above all i can say to you that  today  of all days  was a good day     x   b   edit  there are so many comments that i fear that i may not be able to answer everyone  but i want to thank you all for the kind words of encouragement i received  it means a lot to me in this moment  from the bottom of my heart i thank you all   and for those who are going through similar situations i wish you all the best  be strong and never lose hope  ,0

day     of quitting smoking  started smoking at    and i m now     i m not looking for anything other than a place to express myself please don t hate me  just like everyone else  i ve decided to give myself a new years resolution  i ve had this on my mind for a while and have definitely prepped for this one  i ve decided it s time to quit the sticks and go smoke free   just a little low down  i smoke       cigs on average per day  this varies depending on if i m working  less usually   or if i m drinking  definitely more   i d say it s averages to   an hour    i was always told that your addiction wasn t based off how many you smoke a day but how quickly into your day you smoke your first  so to make myself feel better  i would always make sure i d showered  got dressed and eaten before i smoke  the mind of a smoker  hey    day   was a little shoddy  i craved one virtually every second  at least it felt that way  i didn t leave the house all day  which probably didn t help  i didn t buy any which was a massive step believe it or not  but by the end of the day  i couldn t take it  i can t believe i did this but i went and found like a quarter of a cig in the bowl on my balcony  took about three drags and threw it away  pointless as fuck and regretted it instantly   day   was a lot better  i wasn t in the house as much and i definitely had my mind in other places  i went into the city though  this was rough as there s people smoking evvvverywhere  holy hell the smell was so intense  i felt like a dog on heat  i nearly asked a couple of people for cigs  which is not something i do  ever  the toughest thing about this trip to the city was the waiting walking time  i realised that i fill dead space in my life with a cig  so to do absolutely nothing whilst waiting for a tram or walking felt odd as fuck  but satisfying to know i was pushing through something  challenging my will power and discipline is something i don t do too often  it s nice  it felt good  i didn t smoke all day  and so far the only difference i ve felt is this heavy chest feeling  i know it s my craving  it s definitely like somebody is just sitting on my chest  other than that i m doing okay   i m using a few things to preoccupy myself from touching cigs  one being reddit as of right now  i feel like if i can express myself on here  i can t go against what i ve put on the internet  i d feel like a fool now for going against this so here i am  secondly  i m using tea tree therapy toothpicks to deal with the constant need to keep my hands and mouth busy  seriously though  these things are a fucking blessing and would definitely use them rather than something like a vape or nicotine gum patches  at least this way you re going cold turkey and releasing that nicotine completely  obviously that s just not possible for some  but there s no harm in trying  thirdly  i m reading during downtime to keep my brain off the thought  i m currently reading the witcher books after smashing through the series  and finally  i use an app called headspace from time to time  it s a meditation app that i would highly recommend  it has a series of meditations for cravings so i ve started that and will be using it on the daily now   i ll keep you posted with how i m doing  what i m feeling and how i m dealing with this  to all the none smokers out there  this is no fucking joke  i feel like a god damn crazy person  but we ll see where it goes and why not drag you along for the ride hey    edit  wow  i did not expect this kind of response when i woke up  i ll be going through and reading replying tonight  thank you everyone for the feedback   love it   edit    i ve just spent the last   hours replying to you all  i really underestimated the sheer amount of comments  love and support i would get  i feel like i ve barely scratched the surface and will definitely carry on when i can  in the meantime  keep updated on how it s going everyday  if you re trying to quit too  i d love for you to join me on this absolute motherfucker of a mission  appreciate it guys  thank you  ,0
i just had my first hug after many years i am a    year old student and i deadass cant remember the last time i got hugged  today was our christmas party  we ate lunch together  played games  exchanged gifts  and at the very end  when all of us are going home  my classmates said farewell to each other  even me  but one thing came unexpected  i got hugged  twice  first one was from a friend  and the second one was from our advisor  each hug lasted about     seconds  but boy that feeling of emotion i experienced when i got hugged will last for     years   i just want to share this  i never realized how powerful hugging is  ive seen comments throughout reddit that they needed a hug and strangers gave virtual hugs to each other  i never really paid much attention to its importance  but i do now  so for this christmas  i just wanna tell yall that a gift doesnt need to be always in material form  simply hugging them will make their christmas whole    ,0
i just paid off my student loans   it feels so good to type shout this     i paid off my student loooooans   ahh   that felt good  its been about     years since i started my debt reduction plan and this last   years it really has been moving quickly  and now i just clicked  confirm payment  on the payoff loan button  lookout next debt  here comes a snowball     x   b   edit  a gold   wow thank you so much  i hope this post helps others be inspired to get rid of their debts  im not done yet  but so far its a great feeling  thank you everyone  and thanks again for the gold  much appreciated     x   b   edit    thank you for the silver too  this is amazing  i hope this post helps a lot of people  i am getting a lot of  any advice and how did you do it  comments  ill try to share how i started my process so you all can too      advice      whats the cost  http   www whatsthecost com snowball aspx  is the site i used to enter all my debts and how much i was paying to all of them  once you enter all of that  toggle between balance and interest first  to see what is best for you  for me  balance first saved us a few thousand  plus at the time it was hard to be paying to a debt for years to have it still be there  even if you pay a few grand more over          years  seeing the number of debts you have get less and less is a great reward and feeling  otherwise  you are getting your debt reduced by dollar amount  but the number of debts are still there and it feels like youre getting nowhere  that being said  i like to pick balance first  but everyone is in a different situation  and it may be best for you to pick interest first   now that you have a debt reduction plan  dont forget to update it  new debts come up sometimes  like car problems   redo your debt reduction plan when needed  i have updated mine about    times in the last   years  half of those changes where because i put     of my tax return towards debt  taking thousands off a debt in one go  so  dont forget to redo your debt reduction plan when needed   next  know your finances  whats going in   out   before i would get a check  put it in my account and pay bills  go out to eat  whatever  having to check my account afterward to see if i had any money left or if i spent too much  once i got my debt plan set up  i then talked to my wife and financial advisor through my credit union  for free  and came up with how i manage my money now  i found a video last year that really summarized what i do with my bank account and how i know how much money i have each week  here it is    how to properly manage your money like the rich   tom ferry  https   www youtube com watch v wjb  g tsgo     watch this    min video and you will understand how i have my account setup  ill come back to this in a second   next  i made a google sheet  or use excel   i look at my bank account to see what the lowest average of my last   or more checks was  i use that per check  biweekly     and use it for all my calculations  now i take all  and i mean all of my recurring bills each month and list them  i take the monthly amount and divide it by    in the sheet multiply by     to get a per check amount  yearly bills divide by    to get biweekly  total all of the per check amounts  in sheets  sum  and have that go to a line  labeled bills  that subtracts from my lowest check amount   next  i figure out how much i need for groceries each week  for me      per check  and have that subtract from my every check  next  i put       into savings each check as well  lastly  i put a line item s  for my debts to come out of my check  so my google sheet looks like this     x   b    lowest biweekly check                      bills          groceries          to savings         debt           debt           debt               to spending  whatever is left of check goes here           x   b   lastly  coming back to that video  i go to my credit union and have them make a bunch of accounts  checking and savings  under my one account  i then change the names of the accounts from  checking    savings    savings       to match the above  bills  groceries  debt      and spending  i have the bank set up my account so when my check is deposited into my checking  it automatically sends the amounts i have listed in my google sheet go to each account or loan it needs to  so a lot of my debt reduction and budgeting is automatic  spending and bills are checking accounts with their own debit cards  recurring bills use the bills account card number while i carry around the spending debit card to use for gas  going out to eat  whatever  after all my deductions come out of my google sheets calculations the remaining amount of my check goes into my spending account  this lets me know how much i have each week to spend  about      a week for me   if i work more hours  more money shows up in spending  which i put extra towards a debt or i get myself a treat   again this needs to be updated a lot as bills and debts change  if my spending line item in sheets ever is a negative number  i know i need to cut some things out  like hulu  or get a cell bill deal  remove cable tv     to make it a positive number     x   b   this process has helped me and my family for the last   years  hope this helps anyone who reads it  ,0

today is   years since i quit cigarettes cold turkey  i now know what a rose smells like kinda hokey but   years ago today i made the unplanned and impulse based choice to quit smoking cold turkey  i truly believe that is the way to do it  i say this as ive smoked pretty heavily and quitting was honestly not that bad  not nearly as dreadful as ive always heard it to be  maybe the planning  anticipation  weaning  and nicotine alternatives are what make the quitting process so torturous  a side note to this is ive always seen people smelling flowers and i never understood it and dismissed it as wier d behavior as they always smelled like nothing  the other day i walked past a grocery store floral dept and was hit with a something i never smelled before  grabbed one and i could smell it for the first time i can recall  i guess my sense of smell finally returned  ,0

i am   months self harm free    it has been difficult and hard but honestly these last   months have been pretty good and also motivating to continue taking care of myself  i have a small but great group of friends that make me laugh all the time and my dogs that always make me smile  there are times when everything seems to be going wrong and small things would cause me to worry endlessly but i still manage to pull through and utilise my coping mechanisms   if any of you have also stopped self harming  i m proud of you    edit  i feel like my last sentence made it seem as if i m only proud of people who have completely stopped which is not what i mean dhsjdks so to add on   even if you have relapsed  i m still proud of you for making it so far and i hope you ll be able to quit soon  ,0

my physiotherapist fixed my malpositioned lumbar vertebra  it caused me pain for years and made my life miserable  tl dr  constant pain  physiotherapist gave me the crack  very satisfying  am happy  gonna have a life again   i cannot really express the relief and anger i feel  for more than three years i had issues with my lower back  it started with me not being able to move in certain directions anymore  when i asked my doc  he said that was normal  i was just getting old or whatever   i was    back then   one year ago  the pain started  i could not sit for more than    mins at a time  we tried all the chairs  nothing worked  i got foot orthotics  didnt help  physiotherapy didnt help  i stopped playing volleyball and instead learned proper swimmig technique  swimming helped a bit  but only temporarily  then  the injuries started  there were at least ten of them  i bent over  and pain shot through my entire body  i could not stand  sit  or sleep for at least a day when this happened  i was forced to just lie in bed and cry  the pain was terrible  moreover  i was scared that i might need surgery because so many people who had surgery said it only made their problems worse   i cannot describe how much my life has changed during the last three years  everything i did revolved around not making my back worse  i did not go out because i could not sit or stand for any longer than an hour at best  going to lectures at my university was making everything so much worse  so i basically only did a minimum of what i was required to  even though i love my studies to death  i went swimming at least every second day  but i couldnt go there by bus because sitting  i ate dinner standing in the kitchen  not being able to sit down with my boyfriend  it took so much time from me  my entire energy was drained from dealing with the pain on a daily basis  i lost weight and my friends said i looked miserable   a few months ago  i found out that my spinal disc was damaged and bulged  i wanted to cry  how did this happen  what did i do wrong   the doc prescribed another round of physiotherapy  i was supposed to build muscle to help support my lower back  like i didnt already to this shit every day of my life     my  new  physiotherapist  however  had different plans  in the first session  he noticed from the way that i lifted my legs that i had  what he called  a  blockage   it wasnt an actual blockage  he said   just a malposition of my vertebra  instead of mainly building muscle  i got three sessions of massages and had to do a certain kind of stretch at home  after my fourth session of getting a massage  he twisted my back  its hard to describe   i had to lie on my side and he pushed my upper body over  the sessions before that  this really hurt  but that fourth time  i did not feel pain  so he pushed a little further  my back   crackkkkkkk    oh god  it was so satisfying  so incredibly satisfying  he did this for both sides  and that was the end of my malpositioned vertebra  finally fixed  after years  i had to lie there with a warm pad and do stretches afterwards  and i still have to be very careful with my back so to not cause the malposition again  my body felt wobbly for the rest of the day  now  two days later  my pain is completely gone  i can move my body in ways i could not for years  no problem  i want to cry  i can finally get better now  i can finally get back to having a life again   sorry for this essay  i just cannot keep myself from telling everyone what happened  i can finally leave this shit behind  thanksie for listening      edit  as many people thankfully pointed out  my description of what the hell actually happened to my back was wildly inaccurate  to quote u alphabearmode   what youre referring to is called a spinal manipulation  chiropractors refer to them as adjustments  physiologically  its very unlikely that your physical therapist or any chiropractor for that matter actually repositions bones when they do spinal manipulations  the neurophysiological effect of a manipulation is what causes the pain relief  there may be joints that are  stuck  because of soft tissue or joint capsule restrictions  which associated with pain lead to muscle guarding  which then lead to restricted range of motion  a manipulation is designed to relieved that restriction thereby causing improved range of motion  however  there is no substantial change in bone positioning    im sorry for having drawn such a whacky picture of what my pt did to my back  also  i want to note that my problems are not all miraculously cured  im extremely sorry if i made you all hopeful if you are suffering from back pain yourself  there is still much work to be done from my side  this entire experience was still remarkable to me  though   mainly because i got to experience the sheer possibility of living pain free  which i thought might not exist  so  if you suffer from pain like i do  im sorry if i gave you false hope  but dont let that make you feel down  either  every pain is different  but im positive we can all get better if we keep on looking for solutions     stay strong       ,0
im coming up on    years free from my addiction to crystal meth well  where do i start   my teenage years were a very dark time  i was arrogant and selfish  i began to experiment with drugs including synthetic cannabinoids and bath salts  to make a long story short  i had burned bridges with everyone who loved me and became addicted to methamphetamine  i spent the better part of      homeless and high to the point where my body was literally deteriorating  an    year old boy weighing in at a shocking     pounds  my grandparents took me in and i still was acting like a damn fool  finally  at the beginning of       my dad moved to texas and offered to take me with him  i was so tired of scrounging for dope and being ruled by a substance to the point that it was literally killing me so i agreed to go with him to separate myself from any connections i had to meth  it was a long and hard road to not only kicking my addictions but also growing up   i sit before you here and now  havent touched the stuff in nearly a decade    years  and i have a beautiful wife and   wonderful children  my own car and my own house   looking back  my eyes well with tears to remember what i had become and the things i did  i am filled with pride knowing that i beat my crippling addiction   i am so happy to be here  today    edit  thank you so much for my first silver  this is so encouraging  i did not expect so much positive feedback   edit  wow my first gold and silver on one post  you guys  the flood of encouragement and love im getting from yall is too good to be true  im tearing up right now as i write this  thank you so much   edit  now my first platinum  this is so encouraging  thank you so much for all of your kindness  each and every one of you  ,0

today is    years and   month without a cigarette  it seems theres always people smoking around me  i notice it all the time  friends and family constantly puffing away  when i go out for drinks  the thought of smoking is always there  during stressful times at work or just in general  i think how i could use something to relieve this stress a little  i stay strong though and resist the urge    i do this for my health and the health of those around me  and because smoking is disgusting and as a    year old  im glad i never got into it  ,0
how   year old me was vegan for    hours and    minutes back when i was just a young boy of   years old  my teacher spent an entire afternoon teaching our class about being vegan and about how good it is for the environment and whatnot   so when i came home  fully indoctrinated of course  and my parents and i sat down for dinner  i had something important to announce    the conversation went like this   me    mom  dad  ive got something to tell you     parents    alright buddy  whats up     me    starting tomorrow  im going to be a lesbian for the rest of my life     parents  with raised eyebrows     oh     a lesb    aha    well  whatever floats your boat     me    yup  its true  this dinner will be the last meat i ever eat     when my parents  after a couple of microseconds of exchanging confused looks  realised i mixed up the words vegan and lesbian  they were  almost  literally rolling on the floor laughing   the next day my mom made grilled chicken  french fries  and a   huge   salad  because as a vegan  the salad and french fries would be the only thing id eat   my favorite meal    needless to say i didnt last long  and after   minutes of intensely staring at that grilled chicken  i caved in  and that was the end of my    hour and    minutes of being a lesbian vegan  ,0
i cant watch shows like  the office  because i get too embarrassed for the characters  does anyone else do this  what is that even called  just empathy  like i know if you watch something gory you can get sympathy pain  sympathy embarrassment    edit  so it looks like a lot of other people have this issue too  its nice to know im not weird   or at least not alone in my weirdness  i cant possibly reply to everyone but ive been looking over my inbox  some replies are insightful  others just conversational  the thing i want to point out though is that there are hundreds of comments here and not one is negative or telling me how much i suck or describing my mothers sex life  i wanted to say thank you for that  its very uncommon online in my experience and i hope it stays that way  this sub really is something special  ,0
i kept a baby from going to surgery today im a radiologist  and this is my weekend to work     hours friday  saturday and sunday  its a non stop flogging  ive been feeling fairly burned out lately  you spend all day reading films  and some days you sit back and think   i havent helped anyone today   i missed opening day of little league yesterday and my boys first t ball game  i was feeling pretty low    today  they brought in an   month old baby with   intussusception    https   en m wikipedia org wiki intussusception  medical disorder   as a radiologist  i get the opportunity to fix the problem  i have to do an enema to try to get the colon back into normal position  we typically try three times  and if were not successful  the surgeons take over and open them up    i did my three tries  and got it about     fixed  but it has to be       i looked at the surgeon  and he agreed to keep going  on the fourth try  the babys belly was so distended  he was crying  my tech got sprayed in the face with contrast  very sticky and coming from the babys butt  and i think the surgeons were getting ready to make the calls to get the or ready  all of a sudden  bam   the contrast went where it was supposed to go and the problem was fixed   no surgery   the baby was suddenly quiet because it no longer hurt  the surgeons cheered because they didnt have to cut  even the tech that was sprayed with dirty contrast was happy   she said shed wear it with pride today     this is the best day ive had in a long time and i really needed it   i actually had to go back to my office to shed a little tear out of happiness    now  back to work  let the flogging resume     edit   thank you for the gold and silver    i made this post because i was very happy about being able to avoid sending the baby to surgery  i see studies all the time that are knee jerk  send them to surgery  cases   i thanked my team a lot for their help  and i will certainly speak to their supervisor tomorrow     i realize that my reports are important  even my reports that have no acute findings  being a radiologist  i seldom get to  lay hands  on a patient and even less often haveł such a positive outcome  so often  when i do deal directly with patients  its too give bad news  im sorry  the fetus has died or im sorry  but i really think this is breast cancer  etc     seeing the relief on the babys face when the intussusception was reduced was awesome  that baby had gone through a rough night and hadnt slept much  two minutes after we were finished  the baby was sound asleep    i appreciate everyones comments  there are no heroes here  just a group of people doing what they are trained to do and honestly trying their best to do whats right for this child  fortunately  this time we succeeded   ,0

just over   years ago i was t boned in an intersection by a learner that wasnt paying attention to traffic  today was the first day i woke up without pain  just over   years ago i was t boned in an intersection by a learner that wasnt paying attention to traffic  because of my job  and my lack of proactive work in the beginning  my neck and shoulders tensed up to the point of non movement  since then i have struggled with constant pain and the inability to live my life to its fullest  i havent been able to practice martial arts  archery  or much else that involves my upper body    thanks to massage therapy i was able to start moving again  thanks to an intensive stretching routine that ive kept up       times daily ive had my muscles slowly relax and allow healing  and more recently thanks to my chiropractor my spine has been able to go back to its natural position    after all of that  today was the first day i woke up not in pain  not sore  not stiff  just normal  this doesnt mean my battle is over  im not quite fixed yet  but im close  i feel more human and more myself than i have in   long painful years    there is chronic pain out there that cannot be fixed  i must acknowledge that  but  if you have been injured and feel pain because of that injury  take heart that you can come through it  its not quick  its not easy  and you will need professional help  but its possible to regain a life without pain    one day ill return to my old hobbies  and i will have my life back  i am determined to live a life without daily pain  and today i felt my first taste of success in almost   years  ,0
i spilled coffee on my keyboard piano  and managed to take it apart  clean it  and put it back together without having done so before  i feel accomplished but i dont know anyone that would care idk just kinda wanted to share it  like a dumbass i was drinking coffee while playing my electric keyboard  and while getting up  bumped the side of the cup and spilled coffee on some of the keys  after cleaning the surface  and turning it back on  some of the keys wouldnt respond anymore  i thought  damnit  now i have to get a new one   because to clean it fully i knew i was gunna have to undo all of the screws  and clean it from the inside  even then i figured the circuit board was fried  but it was worth a shot anyway  never took apart a keyboard  so i had no idea what to expect  but i quickly figured out how to remove the keys  and put them back in place  cleaning all of the coffee and dust that was stuck deep inside while doing so  not all of the keys needed to be cleaned  but i thought what the hell  its open now  might as well clean all of them  after some time  screwed everything back into place  plugged my keyboard in  and to my suprise all of the keys become      functional again  im really happy i dont have to buy a new one now  ,0
just locked myself out of my house and i m almost happy i did   i brought the garbage out and forgot to bring the keys with me  which resulted in me being hungry  i just got back from the gym  and outside in the cold weather  i only have my phone with me  grabbed it in the last minute  and that  saved  me  unfortunately none of my neighbors is home to open the building s door for me    now because i live in a first world country  i walked to a nearby restaurant  asked if i could pay with apple pay and ordered a nice warm soup and some chicken  they even offered to charge my phone for me if needed  i m there now writing this and it made me think about how ridiculous my worries are  how ridiculous life is   you see  i come originally from a third world country in africa  if the same situation would ve happened there  i d probably go from door to door in the neighborhood and get offered lunch until one of my building s neighbors comes back  it is also mostly certain  that someone would offer to try and pick the locks of my building for me   if i try this here  i m sure someone would rightly call the police on me   d    why am i telling you this  well  first because i m bored in the restaurant and don t have my headphones with me to listen to an audiobook or some music  but mostly because lately i ve been worrying about so many things in my life  and forgot how lucky i am  not only because of the privilege of being able to pay with my phone so that i don t go hungry and don t have to wait in front of the building in this cold weather  but more importantly because even if i was back home in africa  i would also find a solution and life would go on  ok getting locked out is not that dramatic  i know  stop rolling your eyes    i ve been looking for a job for some months now  the one i found comes with so many complications and risks that i ve been negotiating the contract with them for the last month   i broke up with someone i liked a lot because of circumstances and that left me heartbroken   i ve been struggling with an injury i got after a minor accident last summer and am still taking care of it   so you see  getting locked out is not the most dramatic thing right now for me  but nonetheless it made me realize that i will always find a way and that i am grateful for what i have    thank you for reading  i ll go home now and hopefully one of my neighbors is back home     ,0

there should be a subreddit for pairing people up to do nothing except check in on each other once or twice a week to ask how their day has been  it would be casual  a bit like this subreddit  except only    at most    people would come together together to talk  probably via dm   it would also be a bit like having a penpal  except with penpals theres generally an expectation that youd have interesting things to say  that youd write a certain amount  reply a certain amount  here there would be no such expectation  you can write as little or as much as you like  on totally boring subjects  and the other person would be under no obligation to reply with anything other than an acknowledgement  like   that sucks  hope youre feeling better   or   thats cool    what do you think  would it work  maybe it needs thinking through a bit more  something youd be interested in participating in  ,0

had a dream that pepsi bought a town and renamed it to  pepsi  i had a dream that pepsi company bought an entire town in rural russia to use like a factory town to house the workers of the factory they built there  and housed all the workers in the old dilapidated soviet era buildings  and put billboards and posters all around the town kind of reminiscent of idealistic propaganda of governments  with pictures of cans of pepsi and people holding pepsi cans looking happy  while the town was very dilapidated and polluted  and all the people who worked in the pepsi factory were sad and poor  and the pepsi billboards and posters loomed overhead on all the buildings  plus they renamed the town to simply  pepsi    it was probably one of the most vivid dreams ive ever had  it was very weird  ,0

after wanting to do it for three years  i finally started teaching myself how to draw im    and for my entire life i have hated drawing  it was obvious early on i didnt have a natural talent for it  like my sister had  i spent all my time writing instead  and im not too bad at that now  but ive always liked the idea of being able to draw and recently ive just had so many ideas for drawings i just went to get down  and the details that i could put into it  it got really bad when i first listened to the adventure zone and wanted to do some fanart  yup  im learning to draw so i can do fanart     x   b   but i was too scared to start  and even now i havent told anyone  what im producing is your typical just started crap  but it looks like a person  so this is actually a better spot than i thought i would be in  not just drawing amorphous blobs  im super struggling with what im drawing but i know if i stick to it i should  hopefully  fingers crossed  get better  i want to be able to draw people  and my aim is to get to a point id feel good enough to invest in digital painting   thats where i really want to be  but i know thats a few years away yet      im just so happy to have finally started  been doing it for just less than a week now  no improvement so far  ,0

i crashed my car today kinda on purpose  so it snowed alot today and i got stuck trying to drive home  while going down a steep hill i saw a truck at the bottom with their hazards on  i started going down this hill and all of a sudden my abs started kicking on and i started sliding  trying to not hit the truck at the bottom which at my current rate i would have  i channeled my inner drift star and ripped my e brake as hard as i could locking up my back tires  this caused the butt end of my car to kick out and my car to go sideways  i was aiming for the hill on the  side of the road and i hit it  this split second decision saved me from totaling my car and most likely another one  kinda proud of this one   edit  i don t see how this is clickbait  if not made clear in the post  i purposely slid my car into a snow bank  hill on the side of the road to avoid an accident with a car  ,0

a    year old asked me if i was a bodybuilder and it made me forget my insecurities for a moment i play volleyball as a hobby and last week i played with my coachs younger group   i hit it off really well with them  theyre young but they actually understand my humor  which consists of sarcasm and irony     of the time   so anyways  practice was fun  we had some really great rallies and time just flew  before i knew it we were back in the changing room and there i chatted with the coach and changed my clothes   one thing you have to know about me is ive been really insecure about my body my whole life  up until a few months ago when i finally noticed some change after hitting the gym for a few years and not stuffing my face with food  nowadays i can even get changed  in front of people   incredible right   but im still kinda self conscious   i pulled off my shirt and then a    year old boy asked me if i was a bodybuilder lmfao  obviously  because i cant handle positive feelings  i laughed at him and said  what  uhh no im not wtf lol  and quickly put on my stuff   but it did lowkey feel kinda good  having a teenager think that im a bodybuilder after struggling my whole life with my body image does kinda relieve the stress and it honestly put my mind at ease for a minute    tl dr a teenager thought im a bodybuilder and it made me feel good about my fat ass  fyi  im     ,0

i think i just experienced second hand happiness for the first time  a classmate in my psych lecture today told me today about a date she went on  she was absolutely glowing and was so unbelievably happy  apparently her date was so kind  handsome  and thoughtful  he even asked her to be his valentine  she seemed like a whole new person  usually i suffer from a bit of envy at situations like this  but  today i just felt so happy for her  it put such a big smile on my face and uplifted me for the rest of the lecture   i wish i could be like this more often and be less envious  anybody else have any tips to continue letting go of envy and embracing second hand happiness  ,0

just wanted to say thank you to the guy who told me to shut up at a board game cafe last year i went to a board game cafe for the first time and played avalon  friend of a friend s brother and i  who i had just met  no less  were on the evil team  communicated telepathically and completely masterminded   other players  i was incredibly excited  super proud of myself and him  and many expletives and very unsportsmanlike trash talking followed  then this really sweet guy came over to us and was very gently like   hey guys  i genuinely love how much fun you re having and how enthusiastic you are  but so there are a lot of kids around here and you re being really loud and swearing     i was pretty mortified  i totally didn t register how obnoxious i was being in a public place    cut to today  some high school kids are top volume in an incredibly tiny bubble tea establishment  i definitely have done my fair share of stuff like that when with friends but it was seriously ridiculous  and swearing and talking about pretty heavy stuff right next to a young kid who looked super uncomfortable  maybe for unrelated reasons but still   bonus  they had some of the worst opinions i ve ever heard  they were dragging their transgender classmate for apparently defending cops because  cops would beat the shit out of her  ever heard of stonewall   they had a point in that that kind of brutality is still an issue but if mlk were alive today i think he d tell you that civil rights can advance a lot in    years   anyway    even though i secretly wanted to drop kick them into orbit i was just calmly like hey guys    this place is tiny    there s a kid right here    maybe take it down a notch  i was probably still more passive aggressive than i needed to be but i think before that guy i would ve just been like  shut up you turds  or said nothing at all  so thank you for being a super cool adult and teaching me how to conduct myself in society without humiliating me  i think if you re a good person getting politely called out is sufficiently embarrassing on its own ,0
my refugee neighbours gave me some blackcurrants from their garden  so im making some blackcurrant ice cream for them  they moved here a few months ago  they dont speak very much english  but they smile and wave hello and i see their kids cycling round and i think they go to a local school   not being able to speak the same language as your neighbours must feel very isolating  but hopefully little swaps like this help them understand that were happy to have them here and were happy to be part of their community   these people have come a long way to get their children somewhere where they feel safe and live very restricted lives in many ways  but hopefully they know that we are happy to have them on our street   i just kind of needed to tell someone  you know  i cant tell them due to the language barriers  but hopefully the language of ice cream will help    just as a final little follow up  they gave my a little dish of cooked berries in a sauce this morning  so i think they liked it  also  you people are all really cool as i just posted it on here on a whim because i was in the house on my own  thanks   ,0

as a child  i often thought i fooled people with my clever bullshitting  as an adult who can easily see when a child is bullshitting  i now realize my child self likely fooled   people  its weird to think that  because of this and other similar perspective differences between then and now  ones entire childhood consisted of much different situations than one experienced as a child  like  these events happened and i was present for them  but the things i remember and the things that happened in reality might be sooo different  ,0

i saved someones dog today so this morning at  am i was on my way to work  i reached the end of my street and i looked to my left to check oncoming traffic and i saw this little blonde dog on the sidewalk  unattended  i live in a huge city and this is no ordinary street but rather an extremely busy through way boulevard  i was thinking  this is inconvenient  fuck  but shes small  had no collar  there was no other human around and i couldnt just leave her knowing she could easily be killed  so i flipped a u turn  parked and approached her  with a gentle demeanor i called to her and crouched down about   ft away  she was timid but she came to me and her tail started wagging as i pet her and i was thinking ok     now what   i cautiously tested out touching her tummy   seemed fine  then i tested putting a little pressure on her ribs for picking up   she was fine  so i carried her to my car  she was obviously familiar with cars because she got right into the passenger seat  i called animal control  then the humane society  then the non emergency police line  but nothing was open yet  so i was fully thinking  shit  and i just googled  what to do if you find a lost dog      well it turns out you can take a lost dog to a vet and thankfully one about a mile away was open  off we went  as we drove she got a little car sick  looked like she ate a freakin stick  who knows how long she was out there  but she was so cuddly  she just wanted affection so i was trying to comfort her  i carried her into the vet and i m just like i found this dog help  the vet receptionist checked for a chip and there was one  she called the chipping company  they gave her contact info  and she started calling around  the owner is apparently out of town and the owner s family is supposed to be watching the dog  cringe  thankfully they were ten minutes away and they came to get her   a happy ending  im so glad i stopped  sometimes ya know the dog runs away or gets aggressive and then you cant help  but it is always worth a try   and i wanted to share this story because her name is julian and shes someones precious family member  but also because   chipping your pet could save their life     snaps from the adventure   https   imgur com a sg gvml   edit  ok i know its corny but this really is my first gold  so thank you  chip your pets and put collars with up to date tags on them  ,0

yesterday i found out why my grandmother abstained from chicken meat her whole life my granny hasn t eaten chicken since childhood and i was never really sure why  i knew they kept chickens and just assumed she was a bit sickened by seeing the plating process  yesterday my cousin and i managed to get the full story from her though   she must have been about eight years old and grew up in a house with an open fireplace  the chicks were being kept in a cardboard box filled with straw near the fireplace until they hatched to keep them incubated  and then for a few days longer until they were strong enough to go outside  one day one of them had hopped up onto the side of the cardboard box seemingly looking for freedom  my granny wanted to push it back into the box  but wouldn t touch it because she was scared of feathers  and still is   little bird looks her straight into the eyes  then  flies directly into the open fire    i just had to share this story with someone else because i m still slightly horrified  slightly still laughing about it   edit  obligatory thank you for the silvers  kind anon redditor  much appreciated  can t believe my first silver is on a post about chickens committing suicide  ,0

im indian  but i dont really know my own native language that well  hindi   so im getting comfortable with it by writing down shopping lists  to do lists and other everyday notes in hindi so i can reconnect with it  even though i was born and raised in india  im far more comfortable speaking in english than i am in hindi  which is my own native language  my entire family speaks english predominantly  so i decided to incorporate it more in my daily routine  its feels a but weird  but its a fun challenge  ,0
i think im developing a weird but positive addiction i live in a decent suburban town south of the city where i work  i take the train to work and to get to the train station  i can take a walking path thats a few houses down  which cuts through the woods  past a pond  leading you all of the way to the train platform  super convenient  its usually the best part of my day  i dont turn on my music yet or listen to any podcasts  i just enjoy this    minute walk through nature in the morning  what kind of kills it though  for whatever reason   mostly because humans suck  right where the path begins  and where a few vehicles can park  there is a buttload of trash  and still plenty of trash in the surrounding woods down the whole path    on friday morning when i reached the platform i decided to order a     trash picker on amazon  ever since that moment i was so excited to   pick up trash  i got it yesterday afternoon  damn  amazon  and immediately began the clean up  its weird but i had so much fun  i wouldve went for longer but i ran out of room in the trash bag and paper bag that i brought   i think its so great for me because i like to be outside and enjoy nature  but because i dont have a dog to walk  i always feel weird just being a big dude walking around with my hands in my pocket  people always get that  please dont bother mug me vibe when i walk past a dog walker or jogger  it gives me something to do on these walks and gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment    im annoyed because it snowed last night and now i cant continue the process  the area around the train tracks and the station is absolutely horrific  even though there are some trash cans on this long platform  people obviously still chuck them into the weeds behind the platform    im going to need more trash bags  ,0

my little brother died for    minutes  so i m giving my kidney away i guess i should start with how this happened  my little brother was born three months premature and instead of doing a c section the doctors decided to vacuum the baby out  he was unresponsive for    minutes  the doctors told us to say our goodbyes and not hold on to hope because he probably wasn t going to make it  days go by weeks go by months go by and finally my little brother is unplugged from the monitors and sent home finally to be held   they called him miracle baby and still do  miracle baby however is in stage four kidney failure  we just got the papers today to fill out and figure out if we can donate and all that but i really hope i can and if i somehow don t match with him i would still like to donate because i know how hard and difficult this can be on a family  the one thing i will add is i do need to lose weight before this happens which i have been doing already for the last month  but yeah i m just really hoping everything works out   ,0

im quitting social media this wasnt a planned new years resolution of any kind  it started today when i messaged a close friend  and got left on read    no big deal  i message her again about   hours later with a meme  seen  hmmm  i ended up being really stressed out about it  she was active in friend group chat with me and five others  but didnt reply to my things at all  i ended up getting so stressed that i asked if i made her mad and she told me no   the stress of this conversation and maybe a little bit of an embarrassment from the situation caused me to delete the social media platform that was using  i feel like im an annoyance  and that mentality needs to change  i dont think theyre upset at me  and im not doing this for anyone but myself  just to clarify  this isnt the only reason  i just realized staying off the site would be better for my mental health  so its gone now  im going to be active on reddit and watch some youtube  and just do some things for myself like clean my room  i hope when i go back to school  ill have a better mindset   im thinking of using the internet for more productive things  like i used to  i used to watch drawing tutorials  and i want to learn how to do a backflip  thats pretty random  and im not very flexible  bit it would make me happy if i could do it  so that is my goal    im hoping this can be a good step forward for my mental health  and ill start off with something different  i dont make resolutions  and i wouldnt really call this one  it just happened in the moment   so  i want to hear your thoughts  have you done something similar  what are you doing to make your       better  have a nice day redditors of reddit   edit  awards     thank you kind strangers  this is my first time receiving awards on reddit  and thanks to you im starting my year of with reddit premium  ,0

what if a yearly mental health checkup was required for kids and adults the same way a physical health checkup is  it s pretty common for kids to have to get a yearly physical for school  especially if they play sports  a lot of adults have to as well for insurance policies  or for certain workplaces   what if a mental health checkup was required as well  i imagine it would lead to many more people seeking therapy and the population becoming much happier  more stable  and calmer as a result  who knows  it might even lower violent crime  raise economic productivity  and even improve physical health  ,0

today i learned that you eat popcorn microwaved     i know this is going to sound stupid  but i am actually shook right now  i am not an idiot  ive always gotten as and bs in school  i have a job  and i generally understand how the world works and can pick up on new things quickly    i played a lot of baseball when i was younger and one thing baseball players like to eat a lot of is sunflower seeds  sunflower seeds are just seeds you toss into your mouth and eat  typically  you wouldnt think to eat a seed  but with sunflower seeds it was totally regular and thats just the way youd do it   i always thought popcorn was the same way  you want something to chew on  you rip open a bag of popcorn and either chew them  swallow them whole  or spit them out after chewing them for a bit  that is how i had eaten popcorn the most of my lift  and nobody has corrected me   i know what you are thinking  how did you not realise earlier  did you never go to the movies  i always knew popcorn was associated with the movies  but i thought it was just something you chewed on during the film  after all  who wants to be looking down during a film  it also didnt help that the box we purchased popcorn from didnt show the popped product on it  so i never knew what it was supposed to be like   i always hated popcorn growing up  my parents asked me if i wanted popcorn when we went to movies  and i would always say no  because who wants to chew on that shit during a movie  i would chew a bag maybe once a month  but never any more than that  as i wasnt a big fan   so how did i find out  well recently  i had purchased a different brand of popcorn  this brand actually had the popped corn on the side of the box  which confused me  i got home  ripped open a bag  and started chewing  but then  as i was chewing  i started reading the bag  more specifically  the instructions  as i read the instructions  i immediately spit out my kernals and tried making another bag  popped  in the microwave oven  i didnt think it was going to work  i heard a pop  and immediately opened the microwave  as i didnt think that was good   i know it sounds stupid  but bear with me   i then put it back and let the kernels all pop  the total microwave time was       then  i opened the bag to some yellowish popped kernels  they tasted soft and hard but melted in your mouth all chewy and buttery  it was so good  i finished the bag and immediately microwaved another  i can say without a doubt that this is now my favorite food  and i love it  i always thought you chewed the hard kernels  but now i know you eat it microwaved  i know this story sounds made up  but it is      real  if you want to ask questions or recommend other types of popcorn  please comment     edit    i live in the united states in case you were wondering  i had tasted and loved pirates booty and cracker jacks before but i thought that was a different food entirely and never associated it with popcorn  holy shit though  this might be the best day of my life  for reference i am a    yo male   thanks for gold  glad yall enjoy my story  a learning experience for me  and will be a great story to tell my future children    i will also compile all reasonable suggestions into a list and will try them all and make a followup post if yall would like that    ,0

reddit has educated me much more than any other social media has come close to  for example  i love seeing research posts on the front page  or eli  posts  i read the comments and see experts explain in simple terms how pretty complex ideas work    my most prominent example though is when i was talking to my gf and her sister about contraceptives when we wandering down the  personal care  isle at cvs  they were pretty much only taught about abstinence  birth control  and condoms  they had no clue iud s exist and asked me what the  plan b  was that they saw  i thought it was quite bizarre how two women had no clue about a     pill that ll save you           of a child  just thought it was crazy  couldn t have known it thanks to reddit though     edit  i know it may sound like i may have been  mansplaining  but i was just informing  wasn t trying to be condescending    nd edit  i understand i wasn t mansplaining  thanks everyone for informing me     ,0

had a big mom victory this week  my only daughter started her period this past week  my upbringing was very lonely and there were not any grownups around to help and guide me when i was little so i am determined to do better for my kids  we had talked about the possibility  eventuality  of this occurring and i put a lot of effort into stressing this was normal  and healthy and just one of those things you deal with    so the big day came and she very calmly told me that she thought it had started and i helped get her situated and dropped her off for a lesson  then i went to the drug store and got a fancy gift bag and filled it with tea  and pads  and a few sweet and salty snacks  and a funny card about cats because she loves her cats to pieces  i also got a beautiful bunch of flowers  when i picked her up a half hour later i had everything sitting on her seat in the car and she was floored  she said she was going to open the bag in front of her brothers and if they were jealous she was going to tell them it is only for girls and if they want one then they have to have a period first  ha    we have a pretty relaxed and supportive family so the rest of the fam was more than happy to play along and be supportive  then the hubs came up with the nick name  cramp champ  and we all were cracking up  we are now a few days in and she thanked me for doing that and helping her  i cannot even begin to imagine how she must feel but i do know i would have very much wanted someone in my life to do that for me at that age  i just kind of feel like i nailed this one  i didnt have a good mom model so i wing a lot of this   i wanted to do better and i did  and it made my daughters life better  it is a great feeling    if you have a kiddo in your life dont underestimate a  big  gesture for a milestone  it was inexpensive  practical and i think it just helped send a message that it was gonna be okay    what are some things you would have wanted an adult to do for you when you were young that would have made a difference  ,0

during a very scary and nightmare of a bad bad domestic situation divorce emotional devastation    my kids and i came home to an envelope  inside were gift cards for dinner  an arcade  ice cream and the movies  i didn t know anyone in that town really  i found out the woman who did it was an elderly lady who was the grandma of my daughter s classmate  putting a smile on my kids  faces during such a dark time while being in a financial mess was the most unbelievable act of kindness  from a stranger  good people exist  we documented the date with pictures and colorings for her  little prizes from the arcade  and i will forever be grateful  i never ask for help or share my woes  and it was hard to accept   but i did  like a blubbering idiot  we took that experience to pay it forward during our hard time because no matter what  there are always people dealing with a situation worse than your own  we were poor but there were people who had less than us  kindness is truly contagious  kindness doesn t need to cost anything  thoughtfulness is free     ,0

i ran   miles straight for the first time ever  hi reddit  i just got back from a run and my face is hot and sweaty and red but i m probably the happiest i ve been   for some context  i am not a runner  nor athlete  in general i m pretty close to a coach potato  but i randomly decided today  hey  why don t i go for a run    so i did  and i ran  and ran  and ran  and decided to keep going because i ve always wanted to be able to run   miles without stopping   i think the furthest i ve run without stopping was around a mile for school in  th grade   but gee  my perspective has changed in the short while i ve been out  the run definitely does get easier  after the first mile or so i thought i d wimp out and stop  but i pushed through the heavy  hard breathing  the stitch in my side  and my sore legs   after that hard push everything just got easier  breathing and soreness really didn t matter anymore  i could feel the wind  the clear evening sky  and the rhythm of my breathing was the center of my thoughts  it was so great  all i could think about was the power i had left in my legs and body  as strange as that sounds  i kept thinking  why am i not tired   so i kept going   except  one unfortunate thing  it was evening  so  in the middle of these thoughts it started to get dark  and i also started to get scared because of dangerous people   even though my neighborhood is mainly full of retired old people  but alas  i had to get home    and so here i am  breathless  tired  but so excited  i think i m going to go for another run tomorrow    if you got to the bottom of this long post i commend you stranger  have you ever had any unexpected consequences to an impulse decision  i d love to hear any interesting stories   edit  jeez i woke up this morning with an insane amount of notifications  but thank you for all of your advice i ll take any i can get  i love reading your guys  stories they re so heartwarming   the weather is beautiful this morning  so i think i m going off for a run  ,0
proud of myself for asking the barista to correct my order it s as sad as the title sounds  i m a generally reserved person who gets uncomfortable asking for too much  but i have a long night of studying ahead and really wanted a coffee  order a plain coffee with some soy milk and sweetener  i get handed a basically black coffee  i tasted it and internally screamed because i knew i had two options   drink it and suffer or ask for them to fix it  and i did  after awkwardly waiting to get their attention i asked him if he could add more milk since it was basically black and it was a pretty painless experience  for all my shy people   don t be afraid to ask for a new coffee lol   ,0
interviewed someone that claimed to have done my job  at my former employer  when i worked there nine years ago a cautionary tale for people looking for a job   i work for an it consulting firm  a minor part of my job is to perform  phone screens  on perspective hires  i have a long background in it  so i am used to  resume padding   i try to judge a persons actual technical ability  their ability to fit into our company  how they would do as a consultant  and try and get a gauge of their character  we have a wide spread of technical prowess on staff  so i focus on on the person  after years in it  i think can do this pretty well   last week the owner sent a resume and called me to do a phone screen of a prospective employee  i happily agreed  not having read the resume  i finished my evening and went to bed   the next day i read the resume   this guy claimed to have worked at my former employer  a university   nine years ago when i worked there  doing my job  as a student worker working to gain two masters degrees in two years   before you start laughing  keep in mind this will mess with you  you dont expect this level of dishonesty on a resume  i started asking myself when i actually worked at the former employer  what i may have missed  what could have happened  i actually reached out to former co workers about this person  i managed a lot of the student workers  but not all of them  so i thought maybe i was forgetting someone   nobody knew him  it was suggested that perhaps the resume had formatting errors or he was talking about the wrong university   i decided to give the candidate the benefit of the doubt  but i wanted to be sure about my former workplace  i called the registrars office to verify the degrees  after much checking  we could find no record that he even attended the school   i should have called off the interview  but at this point  i was still trying to give the benefit of the doubt   i called him on time  and started the interview as normal  i explained the position  told him this would be a technical interview  and answered his first questions   we started going through his resume  and i asked a technical question relating to his claimed experience   that is when i first heard the mechanical keyboard  i can not be certain  no video  but i am fairly confident that he was googling the answers to questions i was asking  i adjusted and started asking follow up questions that would be hard to quickly search for  he was unable to answer those   after a few minutes  we got to my former employer  i asked who his supervisor was   i have never heard of the person he claimed   i let him know i worked there at the same time he was claiming   in the it department  like he was claiming   he responded with  oh  sh t    i explained  briefly  that i was the person that would have been his boss  and that he was claiming to have done my job   he tried to tell me that he worked in a different building   this is when i got mad   i told him that there was only one it department for this rather small school   i had to stop myself from calling out all the crap  instead  i just ended the interview    i wasted    minutes of my life   well  he wasted it   i called the employment agency that recommended him and told them everything  including the bogus degrees  i then called several other agencies and gave them the scoop  complete with his linkedin account and resume that showed the same false information   the odds of me interviewing this jerk were insane   i find this both ridiculously funny and infuriating  ,0

my teacher called out my paper on  what not to do  i worked really hard on a paper and it got called out today first thing in class of  what not to do   the teacher excluded my name and other identifying information but he said that the paper was from someone in the class    i felt like cold water was being poured down my back  a prickling sensation all over my body  my cheeks burning up  and my stomach was churning  a girl laughed which made me feel worse    i wrote the paper as best i could  went to the teacher for help  asked for more help over email but each time the teacher just blew me off  i asked other classmates for help too but no one really seemed to understand the paper instructions either  more than half the class did not do well either    it just felt awful to have my paper called out and used as a prime example of  what not to do   what a great way to start a monday   ,0

i helped my company secure a multimillion dollar account   and i have my love of zombie movies to thank for it  background  i work in the shipping industry and my job is primarily focused on dealing with hazardous materials  international shipments  and most importantly preventing and habdling damaged product   i have been on the warehouse floor for    years and have done a little bit of everything  one day our sales rep asked me if i would be willing to share my knowledge with potential clients who come in to see the facility  i was encouraged to discuss my history with damaged goods  how we do the process  the   of damages versus how many packages go through us  and our equipment   well i was getting very good at answering questions and explaining all the processes  when we got a new group in to check out the warehouse  our salea rep brought them over per usual to me at the end   one of their leads started asking me a lot more questions than the norm  how we handle packages whose labels got removed  how we handle product that fell out of a box  etc and etc   i nailed all the questions and ended it with  we have a process and plan for practically any problem      to which the guy responded   and what if there is a zombie outbreak    now i love zombie flicks and am a huge horror nut to begin with  one of my favorite  bored  past times was to make up zombie apocalypse survival plans in my head or with other friends at work  we always joked how we would use the warehouse as a bunker   as such  i switchdd immediately from professional mode to geek mode and without missing a beat i responded    well our walls are    feet high and surround the entire facility  reinforced with rebar and steel to prevent any break downs  we only have one gate in and out for drivers  all we need is to take the trailer off its frame and drop it before the gate to secure it   we have an on site gas station that we can use for any fueling needs including the several generators we keep for backup  once secure we take inventory of all the shipments we have which will most likely include food ammo and other necessities  we have roof access to monitor the surrounding areas and our catwalks allow easy scouting off the ground floor inside  all rooms can be locked and oir security footage can handle our blind spots    it was a knee jerk reaction       geek powered  the looks on their faces were priceless and our sales rep was trying to keep from laughing  they ended up signing up with the company   not because of me but they admitted i helped as my answers were one of the best parts of the tour   it is still one of my favorite customer interactions to date     edit   omg thank you for the silver     edit       gold and platinum   thank you so much everyone ,0

does anyone else have the strong desire to move somewhere isolated and live simply and quietly  when i was a kid i always wanted to have an exciting life and and an exciting job that would take me all over the world  i lived in a small town  my dad worked at a factory and my mom was a receptionist  we took vacations once a year to the beach  other than that we never really traveled much  weekends were mostly helping my dad with projects around the house or hanging out with friends playing video games at one of our houses  after college i lived in   different cities in   years and will have traveled abroad multiple times  now i m in my mid    s  married  and i m seriously considering going to a trade school and learning how to be an electrician or hvac technician and working construction and moving somewhere quiet and rural  i guess my values changed  or maybe i just thought i wanted the excitement  but now what s most important to me is a steady job that will have me home at   every night and a modest house with a good parcel of land to farm and garden  the biggest realization is that i value my life outside of work far more than i value my career  ,0
i just shook a surgeons hand and it was a surreal experience  my girlfriend donated a kidney to her aunt today  and im in the hospital  visiting  being supportive  when the donor surgery was over  the surgeon visited us in the waiting lounge  told us that everything went well  and shook our hands  as he was walking away it blew my mind that  with the help of some tools   those hands just cut into my girlfriend and removed an organ   ive shaken pro athletes hands  sat inside quarter million dollar sports cars  gotten signatures from famous authors  stood on movie sets right where the actors had been  visited historical sites where world leaders lived and worked    but nothing has ever been as surreal as shaking hands with a surgeon  i might just be susceptible because of the personal attachment  just wondering if anyone else can speak on this   edit  trying to keep up with comments and failing  i went through the toplevel stuff for awhile but im sorry if i didnt get to yours  ,0

someone asked for my number today  this has honestly never happened to me  so it was pleasantly surprising when it did happen  i was sitting at a cafe  writing away in my little corner  i specifically chose the corner of the room because i get anxious being in a room if i cant see all escape points lol  anyway  it wasnt super busy but two guys came over next to my table  and one of them asked if they could borrow the chair at my table for their table  not a problem  he was super polite and kind when asking  apologizing for interrupting me and whatnot      x   b   i was there for a few hours writing and responding to emails when i noticed the guy who asked for a chair kept looking at me  normally  this would make me feel super uncomfortable  but it was more of a nervous  almost longing glance  i was pulled out of my writing stupor again when they both got up  and the same guy approached me  he was very nervous and shy but forward when he asked  explaining how he almost never does this and that its okay if i say no  i was so flattered and equally surprised at how respectful and sweet he was that i immediately said yes      x   b   it really brightened up my day  ive always been scared of being approached in that way  but in the warm comfort of my favorite cafe and with this very sweet and polite guy reassuring me that its okay if i say no  i realized that maybe its alright to receive attention in that way  that is  if the person is respectful about it      x   b   tl dr  someone asked for my number today and i was very flattered and accepted  it used to scare me thinking about getting approached in an unwanted manner  but if done properly i think its a beautiful thing       edit  woah  okay  i wasnt expecting this kind of response when checking reddit for the day  thank you for all the positive comments  its really kind of all of you  and for the people who asked for an update  yes  a date is happening on sunday and im pretty nervous about it since ive never been on one before lol  wish me luck   ,0

reddit has completely ruined all other social media for me i can t be the only one seeing this  right    everything  all the content  memes  jokes i see on reddit finds itself on instagram or twitter a few days later  it s like instagram and twitter are just mainstream versions of reddit   this has completely changed the browsing experience for me  now  whenever my friends show me something i can t enjoy it because i already saw it on reddit    idk  maybe it s cool having a first look into the internet but being ahead of everyone kind of ruins the fun for me  i barely touch instagram anymore  at least twitter has some uniqueness lol    just my thoughts for a casual conversation    e  i do love reddit  and i ll continue to use it   ,0

i figured out why everyone is anonymous on reddit  its so you can be honest to yourself  this is solely my interpretation    i was in my office  shortly after a meeting  and some senior employees were having a chat with all the new employees  such as myself   one of them starting talking about politics and supported some policies that i fundamentally disagreed with    in that moment  i could see a few other people noticeably uncomfortable  but no one said anything because we were worried about creating a bad impression  how it affected our relationship with senior members  how it might sound  what others may think   etc      i came back home and while browsing reddit  saw someone mention their support for similar policies as the senior employee had  and without fear  i wrote a comment mentioning everything that i felt  but was too afraid to say in my office    i got to say something that i felt needed to be said and i am forever grateful to reddit to provide me with an outlet to do so  i cant imagine doing so on facebook  or insta    i can be the most honest version of myself here and im so happy to do so  ,0
life is fucking weird  just experienced the biggest coincidence  i am studying in barcelona and i have made a turkish friend here  i m turkish as well but live in europe  so one weekend two of his turkish friends were visiting him from austria  and when we started chatting i asked one of his friends where he was from turkey  and he said this small town  where barely     people live  turns out he lives in the same town where my grand parents live and where i used to go every year  i couldn t  believe it and asked him a couple of questions  he got everything right  then finally i asked him if he knew my uncle  because they re the same age  he told me he was friends with my uncle  biggest mindfuck i have ever had  he lived in the house in front of my grandparents house  of all the  towns he could live from in turkey  he lived in the same one as me and my grandparents do  ,0
i made a custom hoodie for a singer that i like  not sure if he would like it  a day after i gave it to him  i saw him wearing it in public  and he uploaded a photo of him wearing it on his instagram  i still cant believe it   tldr at the bottom    theres a singer whos a part of a singing group that i like  hes few years younger than me  and ive come to the realization that i didnt just like what he does but that he actually inspires me  before the particular moment in my title  i had met him once in april during a fan meet and greet  and in august i saw him perform a mini concert   it was a regular length concert  but with various artists who each performed several songs   after that time  the group announced their first tour  in the united states so i jumped on that  a few days ago i had the privilege of being able to see their soundcheck  go to another meet and greet  and finally see the show    during the meet and greet i didnt show him the gift  bag  that i made him  i just handed it all over to the people running the whole thing and carried on as usual  during the meet he asked me if hes seen me before  which was so surprising because i had only been in front of his face twice in our lives  one of those a fleeting moment    i finished meeting the rest of the group and we took a photo  i left  later on was the concert  and when it ended i carried on my life as normal    as a millennial   generation z  cusp   of course i had to upload a few clips from the concert on social media the next day  as i did this  i looked at some of the groups social media pages  they were uploading clips  almost  live   of what they were up to as they prepared for the next concert in another city    i also see the guy make a post saying something along the lines of  i love hoodies   i think to myself  mostly kidding    is that a coincidence when i gave him one the day before  i think not    and not even ten minutes later  there it is    the member that i gave the hoodie to       wearing the hoodie       in the clip  for about a tenth of a second i see the guy with a sweater the color of the one that i bought him  i thought to myself  thats different than the color of their merchandise  right    as they havent really worn much anything other than that during tour  and i looked away  i told myself to calm down  that hes not wearing it  that i shouldnt get my hopes up  that my goal was accomplished as long as he had it and did whatever he felt necessary with it  like pass it on to someone if he didnt like it  etc   after i did that  i cautiously watched more of that clip  staring at the sweater  i had no proof that it was mine    but then he turned around  and at that moment   it was real    that was definitely the one that i made because thats the only one that exists that looked like that  not that it was a special sweater  design wise  but it was made in a way that you could tell it wasnt made by a machine   i couldnt scream  but i yelled all sorts of expletives   its rare that i curse   i was home alone so i could freely let all of my energy out    i hurried to show all of my friends the clip of him to show them that it was my sweater  which in hindsight was kind of pathetic in a funny way  haha   they share my excitement  and minutes later i get a notification from one friend  just freaking out  by this time im just like  what   because ive reached peak level excitement and surely whatever she says wasnt going to have been necessary for the way that she wrote it  but then she shares me a new post and its from him    these posts he made with a photo wearing it had over hundreds of thousands of likes    to be fair  you could barely see the sweater   and only the front at that  when the part i decorated was on the arms    but that doesnt matter  i know that thats    whats what i gave him    that was my first time ever giving a well known person something  i never thought that i would  but something just made me want to make him a gift  out of all people i knew he would likely be appreciative but i didnt imagine the posts  let alone so soon  i was just hoping hed    see    the sweater    i wrote him a somewhat personal  somewhat goofy letter that i put into the gift bag i got him  i dont know if he read it or just saw the sweater and liked it  but in the letter i explained why i chose the design wording on the sweater  i like to think that he read the letter and made those posts to   firstly  freak me out  because who doesnt love surprising their fans  i guess    and secondly  give me a sign     and thats the story about how i  a casual fan of someones work and personality  freaked out over a hoodie                                                    tldr    i made a singer that i admire a custom hoodie and gave it to his staff to give to him after a meet and greet that i attended  i made him the hoodie because i thought that at the very least he would appreciate it  even if it wasnt something he personally liked  along with the hoodie  i gave him a few other things in a gift bag  one of the things being a short letter explaining why a hoodie and why what i put on it  i leave the event  my job done  having had a good time  the next day he posted on his social media about how he loved hoodies  my eyes wide open  about ten minutes later i see photos and videos of him wearing the hoodie not only on his group members social media profiles  but also on profiles from fans and his own profiles  my friends and i are the only ones who know what happened  so its kind of an inside thing  well  until now i guess  but still  kinda                                                               edit  since a lot of people asked     its a latin boy band called cnco   pronounced like english

i m two weeks sober from an   year cocaine addiction  been doing lots of thinking and working on self improvement  i m feeling fantastic and free for the first time in years  anyone else feeling great because of positive choices they ve made  i ve been thinking a lot about the genetic  psychological  and environmental deterministic factors making up our conditioning   or as psychiatrists call it  the bio  psycho  social model of behaviour   it s scientifically shown that there is a biological genetic component to addiction  so too is there a psychological component based on our childhood experiences  our upbringing how we were raised  and of course there s the environmental sociological factor of your current conditions  socio economic status  support systems etc      but as i ve been reading i ve realized like pavlov s dogs  so too is the addict conditioned  like the dogs salivating at the ring of a bell  the addict uses at the siren call of a craving  but a man is not a dog  a man need not be a slave to his conditioning  between stimulus  craving  and response  using   man has the freedom to choose  i choose to break free of my conditioning  i choose to be sober    how have you exercised your freedom to choose   i d like to hear from others who ve broken free from their conditioning  ,0

someone once told me a deja vu is life telling you that you are on the right path  that you are where youre supposed to be and your future self has been there before i think thats a very romantic way of looking at it  but its something thats stuck with me for years now  whenever i experience a deja vu  and i experience very few  i go back to this   oh  so this means im on the right track   sort of like your life giving you a nod that  you are supposed to be here   let me show you  your future self has been here  so you feel like this whole thing is familiar  because you are supposed to be there  youve been there  its kind of nice when it happens  you forget about it  so all the times you are not having a deja vu  its not about  oh  im not on the right path  but when you do suddenly have one   this comes to mind and it gives me such a positive energy  i dont normally believe in any of this stuff  but its a nice way to look at it dont you think  ,0

what s the best unorthodox date you ve ever been on  i had i think the best date ever yesterday  was talking to a girl on tinder and met up with her for a date  it was already pretty late so we went and got ice cream and just talked  for hours  we tried to find something to do but it was so lay that almost nothing was open  we finally just ended up going to walmart lol  and just walked around and talked  we looked at all the really bad books in the romance section  the toys  the movies  and just talked about them and laughed  i ve literally never laughed harder and for as long as i did last night  she has the best sense of humor and we were just so in sync the entire time  we literally sat on the floor laughing at stupid looking romance novels for an hour at least  afterwards we just drove around  we listened to her favorite songs  she told me stories about herself  and we talked so much  i feel like i know her better than some people i ve been in relationships with for months lol  finally i took her back to her house to drop her off and we ended up sitting in my car talking for at least another hour  we have another  more  normal  date tomorrow  dinner and a movie  and i ve never looked forward to spending more time with someone as much as this  such a strange first date but it s honestly i think one of the best i ve ever been on   ,0
a former bully just called me to apologize so im a junior in college now  but when i was in high school  i was bullied for being jewish  never anything physical  or deriving from anything malicious  but just bullied  so yesterday  the main perpetrator reached out to me and asked me to give him a call  im not sure why  but in the back of my head  i felt like i knew what the conversation was going to be about  he had never been a bad kid  he was just a goofball  but back then  it didnt really matter  i was lonely  practically friendless  and really physically immature for my age  i was isolated  and i guess he picked up on that  and saw me as an easy punching bag  incapable of punching back  the worst part is that deep in my heart  i really wanted to be friends with this guy  i thought we had a lot in common  and shared a similar sense of humor  he hung out with the cool kids  i didnt hang out with anybody  so i would take the abuse  hoping that by weathering the blows  id somehow become buddies with him  but we never did   anyway  so i give him a call today  feeling a bit apprehensive  i knew he would be nice on the phone  because deep down  he was always a good kid  so were doing some small talk  and i finally just say   what did you want to talk to me about   he paused  and then told me how upset and infuriated he feels about all the hate in the world  especially in the current american political climate  he loathes racism and bigotry  but has always felt like a hypocrite  he told me that  every now and again  he thinks about how he treated me  how he made the jew jokes for the laughs and because he knew i wouldnt fight back  then he started to sound a bit choked up  and just said  im sorry   and  just like that  i forgave him  its not like im a push over  but i knew that he really  really meant it  and i respected the hell out of him for making amends  i told him that  at the time  he did a lot of damage to my self esteem and my psyche  but im alright now  then we agreed that next time we were in the city  wed meet up  im actually looking forward to it  maybe well finally become friends   i dont know why i felt the need to share this  its just kicked up a lot of memories and feelings i thought were in the past  and now im not sure how to cope with them  anyway  thanks for reading  if anyone has a similar story  id love to hear it  ,0

i got a job at golden corral and i left after only   weeks  today was my last day  no other job has made me feel as appreciated as this one so some context   im broke   as shit   golden corral offered me a job and i took it because at the time i just needed money   my friend put in a word for me at best buy a few days after i started  and i didnt particulary  want  to be at golden corral anyway so i jumped on board   put in my two weeks and the countdown started   they put me up front as a runner  so basically my job was to keep cups stocked  ice machines filled  refill tea  etc   essentially the cashiers best friend  without me there they would have to do all of that themselves on top of checking people in   so most of my time was spent up front with them   at first it was daunting because ive only ever been boh at restaurants  so being up front around people was a change lol   didnt care for it much but it grew on me a lot     now the appreciation part  my manager  my co workers  everyone there was so good to me   we all had a great time together every day we worked  there was never any quarreling or bad blood between anyone  just good vibes all around   thats honestly what made the job for me  knowing the people you work with actually  want  you to be there is such a morale booster   it was just fun   people were genuinely sad that i was leaving   a server gave me a hug  got my two main girls snaps  and my manager straight up made my heart melt before i left   shes lucky she didnt see me tear up     so yeah   even if you only spend one month at a job it pays to end on good terms ,0
right now would be a great time for the google street view cars to go around the earth  if you think about it  google and other map companies could save so much time and money not having to censor as many peoples faces and license plates now and they would also be able to have their cars get around faster without all of the traffic that would be there if most of the world wasnt in lockdown  ,0

i had a crazy  scary night last night i have to tell someone about  major lurker on reddit for the last few years but this seems worth posting about   so i was laying in bed with the wife at about midnight  she was fast asleep and i was almost there when i heard my doorbell ring  i get out of bed and go down the hall to the front and ask whos there   some girl says her name is allie  so i crack the door open to see what the deal was  long story short she and her bf tell me their truck is stuck in a ditch down the road and asked if i could help them pull it out  with my truck that was parked in the driveway   okay    ive been there so i agree and tell them to give me a minute to get dressed    they seemed a little sketchy so i was wary from the get go  but hey im sure i look a little sketchy to some people too  and the town i live in has a high poverty level and i was way below it for many years myself  so i tried not to judge to hard and just help    anyways we get in my truck and everything seems chill  were talking about how they have a   year old and i have   kids myself   i get close to where they told me their truck was and i see a couple cop cars stopped at it checking it out with their lights on  the first thing these people say is  oh fuck  keep going      i was a dumb kid once and had my share of run ins with the law over doing stupid dumb kid stuff  i ask them what they got in the truck  the guy says they have a pit bull in the truck  okay    i dont buy that for a second because there is nothing illegal about that in this town  it wasnt worth the way they were acting    so i drive past their truck and immediately one of the cop cars start following and im telling these kids that we are gonna get pulled over and they beg me to tell the cops thats not their truck  i tell them im going to tell the cops exactly what happened of course because i dont know you people  sorry bout your luck    sure enough the lights come on for us to pull over so i stop my truck right there and kill it  this is where stuff gets a little crazy  worth mentioning at this point i notice the guy shoving something under my seat  i assumed it was drugs    i roll down my windows as the officer is getting out of his car and i hear the very distinct sound of a round being chambered in a weapon  the officer puts on his authoritative voice and tells everyone to show their hands  he then orders the driver  me  to get out of the truck and keep facing away from him with my hands in the air and slowly walk backwards till he says to stop  when he stops me he tells me to get on my knees  he asks me whos in the vehicle and whats going on    i tell him straight up these kids knocked on my door  said they were stuck  then freaked when they saw the cops  hes very reasonable and professional  tells me hes going to detain me until he gets this figured out  so he handcuffs me and sets me in the back of the squad car  im not freaking out or anything myself because i live a block away and it can be verified easily that i was just being a good samaritan      he then goes and gets the guy out of my truck  handcuffs him and puts him in the back of the car with me while he goes and gets the girl   i turn and look at the guy and say  what the fuck man  im just trying to help someone out and yall got me handcuffed in the back of a cops car with a rifle drawn on me      the kid was very apologetic to me and says he swears he dont know whats going on  i tell him no big deal  shit goes south sometimes and i know im in the clear     after the officer talks to the girl he cuffs her and puts her in the backseat after getting me out  he tells me they verified what i said and tells me that the truck that was stuck is stolen out of kansas  he then asks me if i own a revolver and asks that if he goes and looks in my truck and finds a pistol that it definitely wouldnt be mine  i tell him no sir i only own rifles and they are locked up at home  he asks for permission to check in my truck and i give it to him     i kid you not he went right to where the guy was sitting looks under the seat and comes back with that pistol he asked about within    seconds  so not only did they ask for help with a stolen vehicle  this dude had a freaking fully loaded     special in his pocket too     the cop kids around with me a bit and says no good deed goes unpunished  huh   i give him my information and phone number in case he needs an official statement from me  he thanks me for cooperating and sends me home  that was all the information i got about those two though im sure they are going to the county jail for awhile    i get home  open a beer and tell the wife about the exciting last thirty minutes of my life  she reacts accordingly and tells me im not allowed to help strangers in the middle of the night again  i finally get back to sleep for about two hours and now im sitting here typing this up in a sleep deprived and adrenaline fueled daze   i know this got long and thanks to anyone that made it this far  i just thought the lovely people here would like to hear this and id love to hear your thoughts on the matter     tl dr     got woke up in the middle of the night  thought i would help someone get their truck unstuck the way i have been helped before  ended up getting an ar pointed at me  handcuffed and put in the back of a cop car for awhile     edit  the response to this post has been amazing  the comments from both sides of the discussion on being a good samaritan have been truly thought provoking and you all have given me a lot to think about  you guys are awesome thanks for all your input    also im trying very hard to reply to as many people as i can but in between kids soccer games and my own family and friends wanting every detail im falling behind  so if i miss someone i promise i have at least read every comment on here   ,0
my boy is doing hard things  i am the parent of a gifted   year old boy  i think he gets it from his mom  i m just a glorified wrench turning monkey   academics come easily to him  mathematics  language arts  you name it  he appears to be a gifted distance runner  as well  he s caring and compassionate  goes out of his way to be helpful to everyone  i joke with my wife that he has to be the mailman s kid  because he definitely doesn t follow in his dad s footsteps    he is also quite sensitive  he s never developed his father s thick skin  whenever something goes wrong around him  he apologizes and looks like someone ran over his puppy dog  we ve had the  not everything that goes wrong around you is your fault  and there s no need to apologize  talk  but it doesn t seem to sink in  and like a lot of gifted children  i m told   when something challenging comes up and he doesn t immediately grasp it  he gets frustrated beyond belief  and often shuts down  often breaking into tears  as well  i ve tried to coach him on this  and try to coax him through  with little result    but   he went to his first tae kwon do class this week  he s been wanting to try martial arts  so i found him a class i could get him to that fits into our schedule  the class started with various agility drills  stretches  etc  then  as they went into a series of punches and kicks that have to be demonstrated successfully before earning their first belt  it began to happen  the class moved through them quickly  and of course  it s his very first class  he was struggling  and one of the instructors moved closer to him to try and teach him  of course  he s still not getting it  throwing the wrong punches  stepping off on the wrong foot  etc  he began to get frustrated  first his face took on a pinched scowl  the began to turn scarlet  and then the tears came  the class continued to go through the movements  and he continued to flail and struggle    and he didn t stop  he didn t shut down  just continued on with tears of frustration and anger  but he continued  he looked like a blooming idiot  if i m being honest  but i started to tear up  because for perhaps the first time  my boy  instead of throwing up his hands and quitting  he worked through it  he didn t get it  for sure  but he kept on working through it  i have never been prouder of anything more in my life  than i was watching my son doing hard things  failing  and persisting    he s gonna get it right one day   and he s going to be amazing    anyone else have kids in this situation  where they tend to shut down when things get hard  how do you coach them through it  ,0

i just got an amazing job offer post divorce that will let me      support myself  when i went through with my divorce several years ago  i gave up a lot of benefits  my ex was military  and instead of screwing him over i chose not to take half of his retirement  or any of our government savings  i have been supporting myself by doing what i love  teaching horseback riding lessons    though money has been fine since the divorce  the fact that i have no benefits  no real long term savings plan  and no way to support myself if i m injured has really been weighing on me  i have been out of the traditional workforce for nearly    years  and though i went to a great university  i dropped out to get married and move across the country before i finished my degree    on a whim i applied for a job that wildly out qualifies me  but i knew i could do well if given the chance    and i got the job    unbelievably they are paying me even more than i expected  have great benefits  and are thrilled to have me  i am so proud of myself i could just burst  but hate to continually talk about it to all of my friends and family    i was so scared to go through with the divorce after    years knowing that i would be on my own  but here i am  thriving and happier than ever   to anyone out there who is afraid of making big changes  i encourage you to make the jump  you got this     edit  there has been some concern for the fact that i didn t take everything i was due from my ex spouse  i just want to say that in no way do i encourage others to follow my lead  everyone s situation is different and i had reasons why i made my choices  military spouses are amazing and have to sacrifice so much  there is good reason that they are entitled to half of everything  if you need want it   take the money and don t feel a bit of remorse  i knew that my ex would need the money more than i would   but it did cause a lot of anxiety to walk away    thanks everyone for the incredible show of support    ,0

it is insane when you think about how many times you trust strangers day to day  when you walk onto a bus  train or plane  you are trusting someone you dont even know to take you somewhere  and do it safely    ordering food means trusting the person making your food  and you eating it    even just walking with strangers down busy streets while we are all in our own bubble  and trusting that everyone is on the same page of wanting to do the right thing  even as we are aware that this isnt always the case   we trust each other so much thats its like a silent agreement to keep the peace and to leave each other the fuck alone    edit  the comments so far have been the high point of my day  all of a sudden i have a soft spot for humanity  you are the chiefs    edit    now i understand why everyone starts an edit with wow  i just woke up  time zones  to this great response  every single comment hasnt gone unnoticed  incredibly interesting point of views  now we can all be hyper aware of strangers together   ,0

i unsubscribed from all the main subreddits of this website   especially the news and politics subreddits   and the world is already a brighter place just a few days later i stopped watching tv absolutely years ago  and buying newspapers too  but the problem with reddit is that all of that corporate  proto fascist  anti immigrant  pro capital rubbish is plastered all over this website  so i have been consuming it directly anyway   i unsubscribed the other day  after waking up to yet another inbox full of shit from people who are sleepwalking through the world  believing that the bbc or cnn is telling them everything they ought to know about reality   im never going back  im sticking to the lefty subs and the music theory subs  and practicing more guitar   i urge you all to consider dumping the news trash from your feed  and have a lovely wednesday  ,0
im very drunk right now and i want you all to know that i love and appreciate all of you   you can do it  whatever youve set your life goal as  you can fucking do it because i believe in you and youre fabulous   my bridesmaid cancelled on me and im a little salty about it  so i drank a whole bottle of wine by myself   the mods deleted my first post because there wasnt enough text  thats just rude   drunk me says what sober me thinks even though i mostly lurk  you can do it  you can be as good of a person as you want you be  you can do amazing things  i just graduated with my bachelors degree in what is arguably the hardest field to get your bachelors degree in   it took me longer than most  i had so many odds working against me but i did it and im so proud  if i can do it  you definitely can  even if no one believes in you  i do   edit  some people wanted to know how im feeling the morning after  i have a slight headache  but thats about it  i drank a ton of water before bed  edit    thank you so much for all the positive comments  theres too many to reply to  but im reading them all as they come in  you are all wonderful people and its nice to see the positive side of reddit  ,0
reddit can go from super wholesome to fucking toxic in no time  as i have  seen a lot of  subs like r gardening   r  baking or r aww seem so wholesome  its almost a wholesomeness overload   people praising and replying with      reddit also provides support and advice to victims  it is sometimes quirky and fun r teenagers  r hydrohomies etc    overall a pretty nice place    on a flipside there is a debate sub for almost everything atheist vs religious people  men vs women  liberals vs conservatives racists  homophobes  and whatnot  people trying to almost fucking kill each other with their words    these two flip sides of reddit never fail to surprise me  ,0
i just had one of those moments in life where everything seems perfect and i am completely happy this morning i was nudged out of a deep sleep to realize that my husband  who always gets up earlier than me  had delayed getting out of bed in order to move over and gently hug me for a few minutes   he obviously didnt intend for me to wake up  and as i lay there with two cats sleeping on top of me and being cuddled by the man i love while having the opportunity to sleep in on a sunday  i was almost overwhelmed with how happy i was   my username seems non ironically appropriate today    ,0

people are so scared of making eye contact with strangers but i love it  today i had been in a subway car for a bit and the guy sitting across from me had been there for about the same time as me  he was clearly thinking to himself  i saw him shake his head a few times  i had been too  and once my thought trailed off i happened to look up in his direction and he happened to do the same  usually people break eye contact with me pretty quickly  but this time we both held our gaze for a few seconds  realized what we were both doing  and then just gave each other the most genuine grins  we broke eye contact then but before he got off we smiled at each other and waved and he told me to take care as he left the train  i ve always been one to make eye contact when i m walking in the street or in the subway like that and most people i talk to about it think i m crazy for doing that  but i live for moments like that  it sticks with me and makes everything feel more human  yknow   i ve been in a bit of a dark place this week and that small moment made my entire day so much better  just wanted to share  much love to anyone who took the time to read this    ,0
anyone else a loner and accept it  i had a stupid childhood in a sense that at school my mom was considered a weirdo with bad social skills  so my classmates parents would tell their kids not to talk to me  i ended up being the ugly girl with the weird mom  so because of all that  i was ignored and learned over time to accept being a loner  even though its always given a bad rep  today im gonna go get lunch by myself at a nice restaurant because dammit i wanna go and i literally have no friends in my hometown so fuck it  if i wanna to go a nice restaurant i dont wanna wait around for others because theres no one else to go with me  so im gonna go enjoy my delicious dinner in about half an hour or so and enjoy my own company     x   b   are any of you loners  have you accepted it  ,0

i got the weirdest internship long story short  im    turning     and ive been on sick leave for little over   years due to mental health issues  late last year  i was admitted into a program to get me an internship to get used to work    my background is in social science and music  i got a base education in psychology and sociopsychology  and ive held positions as therapeutic assistant on daycare centres for people with disabilities  ive been a store assistant  and most recently  a librarian at a local newspaper    ive been spending my overwhelming ammount of free time playing games  board games and tabletop rpgs  primarily  i saw that a small lfgs  local friendly game shop  opened in time  so i sent them an email saying  hey  i work for free     they took me up on the offer  we had a meeting discussing my experiences and qualifications  and what the store needed  they came and said what they really need is someone who can be social and play games with costumers and visitors  theyve been missing having an in house game master  so they asked me if id ve interested    so  starting tomorrow  ill basically be a professional board gamer  its so weird  because this is what i used to do as a teenager instead of doing my homework or applying for summer jobs  so while they cant hire me full time  having this internship makes me eligible for wellfare checks  and earns me a little more from that check than i did when i was sick without an activity  its surreal  but nice to see my experiences are paying off somehow  ,0
a girl complimented my clean car and it made my day one of my female friends  i am a male  got into my car for a ride and said   wow your car is so clean    i responded with a non committal   really  i think its alright  is having a clean car really that big of a deal   then she said  well you are your car   my car is nothing fancy  but im proud of it and how i maintain it  i dont always feel that way about myself so it was a very nice self esteem boost   edit  i took it as if you have a clean car  you are a clean person or if you take care of your car  you take care of yourself  but if she meant im a transformer then im equally happy about that  ,0
i have been training myself to drink unsweetened coffee i started out my adventures in coffee as a college sophomore with vanilla lattes  which are a low risk entry point  that was years ago  and i kept with that drink consistently the whole time  then i decided to start losing weight a year or so ago and looked into how many calories a    ounce latte can have   more than i wanted to budget for a warm drink most days  plus  lattes are kind of expensive    so i switched to non fat lattes for a half year or so  but i still knew that i was missing out on a whole world of potentially cheap free coffee  so  after consulting a few handy coffee style charts on the google  i found a low calorie  cheap er  option  the americano   i started with cream and sugar  now im down to cream only  and  unlike all my past experiences with plain drip coffee  i actually enjoy these non sweetened beverages  in fact  i had a vanilla latte the other day on a lark and found it way  way  way too sweet to bear    its a small point of pride for me  i feel somewhat more grown up now  ,0

it took a really famous football star to convince the uk politicians that kids shouldn t go hungry during the school break  how crazy is that  marcus rashford  an english rising football star  probably already a legend by now   just changed the world for     million children in the uk  he convinced the uk politicians to take a u turn and allow eligible children to claim their free meal voucher during the   week school break during the pandemic   is this really the world we re living in  i m not from the uk but i m astonished by how these politicians all over the world are making their decision  the fact that they had to u turn their decision is what really blew my mind  how would anyone think that it s okay to let the children suffer especially during a global crisis    ,0

i was finally able to use something in real life that i learned on reddit was getting something out of the fridge when my hand knocked a glass jar  almost full of this thai sauce i had just bought  the glass exploded everywhere when it hit the ground   then i remembered the tip i read a couple of weeks before that said to use your phones flashlight and shine it across the floor  so i did and it worked perfectly  even the smallest pieces of glass i wouldnt have seen otherwise gave off a big shadow so i could find them   it was still an arduous process  but it was nice knowing i got every single piece instead of missing any ,0
i would like to make a movement for t shirts with no text i find too many good shirts are ruined by overly obvious or unnecessary text  say for example i see a pretty cool star wars shirt with darth vader on it  the pic is cool and i like the style  but in huge letters at the top it says  darth vader   that shit is lame as hell  now its different if text is part of the logo like nasa or doom but like  so many things would just be better as a logo or picture on its own  edit  would anyone here buy a t shirt that just said  logo  on it  ,0

my dog was found after   days    days ago  i made a post stating my dog was stolen lost  i ended up knowing he wasnt stolen since my neighbors saw him roaming around the neighborhood  this made me keep my hopes up  fast forward to today  someone called saying they have been taking care of my dog for the past   days  hearing these news made me really really happy  we drive down to the location that the caller gave us  and he was there  seeing him again in perfect condition made me cry  i thanked the man  told him how much it meant to me seeing him again  he is now with my other labrador retriever playing  thanks a lot to the people who told me to not put down my hopes  thank you   edit  if you wish to see my dog  head down to my profile anyways  thank you so much for the comments  i wish you guys a happy thanksgiving for tommorow  ,0
stood up for a girl on the train happened   days ago now   im on the train going home from work  there is a girl down the carriage from me  sitting in the corner  a few stops down  everyone around her has gotten off  another couple of stops  and three guys get on the train  two of them obviously very intoxicated  one of them appearing fine  they are already in the girls personal space   walking right in front of her and sitting all around her  she tries to ignore it  but it is very obvious she is uncomfortable  i am not the only one to notice this  i can see everyone else on the carriage looking with me in the girls direction   the guys start talking to her     asking her name  and some weird stuff like does she like curry  idk why curry is a big deal to these guys   out of the three guys  one is not really talking to her and awkwardly watching his friends  one is leaning towards her and trying to make a move  the other is cheering on his mate  she answers their questions and tries to sell that shes not interested by  from my opinion   not making eye contact  one word answers  not taking headphones off  concentrating on her phone  the male leaning toward her suddenly gets up from his seat and stands directly in front of her  within  ft   i am already up from my seat as my stop is coming up  i see this and address it straight away by telling the guy to  leave the girl alone  she just wants to go home  shes obviously uncomfortable   etc  he turns around and a argument starts  i stick to my points  but of course hes not having any of it and is getting more aggressive  one of his mates has chipped in and told me to mind my own business  the other is not saying anything   seeing that they are all now focussed on me   i tell the girl that she can get up and move  which she does immediately and moves to the next carriage  i now do my best to defuse what i have started  as there is no point to continue to argue  at the same time i arrive at my stop and transit officers are at the door   i  and another guy who was watching  tell the officers what has happened  the officers hop on the train as i hop off  i can hear the officers already addressing that the three men are intoxicated  i watch from the platform where the one male i began to argue with is appearing to show regret remorse  i hopped on my bicycle and practically teleported home as my mind was racing   i told my so when i got home and she told me well done  and that most guys wouldnt do anything until it was too late  im glad i did something     x   b   edit  so this blew the fuck up  thank you everyone for your support   ill try not to toot my own horn but will add some more context     i actually work in a hospital as in house security  so in a sense im sort of used to dealing with confrontation       i had a lot of space between me and the three guys  so my plan was to back up and hit the emergency driver contact  should it have escalated  i also had my bicycle with me and would have used that to get more distance  the key is making space  dont let someone get close enough to hit you for the sake of standing your ground or trying to appear tough      this in particular was a personal success for me  growing up  i always froze up or just watched  so it was nice that my experience with work helped me to speak up      i will also say most people dont know what to do when confronted with stuff like this  even as the victim  the most obvious solution might seem impossible  its not easy      and yes  i would have helped if it was a guy  makes no difference  ,0
i literally am obsessed with pillows i sleep with    pillows and i already feel like it not enough  like i used to have    and that would take up half my bed    idk man i just like pillows  edit  thanks guys  did not expect so many upvotes or that people would actually find this interesting ,0
alright  im going to drink only water every day for this next week  wish me luck  extra details in the post  disclaimer  only water as in the only beverage i drink is water  i have food  too  i apologize for the people who have fasted because of me  stop fasting and get yourself a burger or something please  edit    its sunday  im super busy tonight so i found a time window right about now earlier in the evening  overall yes i can attest to the changes ive described even just a little bit  i am more focused  more ready  to  focus  more confident  less slouchy lazy  and most of all  my view on drinks has been changed   to me   any other drink thats not water is just water with other unneeded stuff in it  i feel super healthy making healthier choices and stuff  i know i can always get water  its free  i save money in the process  have a good one yall   i will provide an update at this same time  around   pm  this upcoming sunday  maybe in the middle of the week on wednesday  too in the afternoon   edit   because i wanted to delete the other edits  hows it going everyone  today is wednesday  bad news  caved on tuesday for a small cup of coffee in the morning  headaches got to me  other than that i had just straight water  no more coffee this week  no matter how many headaches i get  and dont worry  this morning i skipped the ole joe   at everyones own discretion  you dont have to have the headaches for me if you dont want to feel like it  but if you feel confidently you can do it then of course youre welcome  bear with me  you know what i mean and good luck if you choose to do so       in the case of simply water consumption  so far im feeling admittedly better than i was on monday  my skin hasnt really changed to any degree that i myself notice  so still checking out how it might change  basically i poop more often  am more focused in general and more productive too  and feel slightly more confident than i do when i stuff myself with other liquids and stuff  think about it  humans were designed to drink water  and ive been skimming over this fact for a long time  skipping dessert is easy when i think about how bloated i will feel if i eat it  being addicted hampers progress early in the day because your brain says  i can only be happy productive awake  if  i get the coffee   with water  you can have   glasses and be good for the morning if youre not too thirsty after that  i tended more towards seeking out work  not the time afterwards when theres no work  if that makes sense  due to the water making me feel refreshed and ready to be productive  knocking the coffee out of my mornings  albeit difficult  and since i love coffee lol   is a worthwhile thing to do  the headaches are continuing for sure   this is the first time ive ever had a caffeine headache in my life so no wonder i felt strange starting off with this  but it wont deter me  its been hard  though  not gonna lie   but i know itll be worth it   thanks again everyone  hope yall have the best of luck   thanks again everyone for all the well wishes  see you all on the other side of this great wall of water     ,0
my husband is a sleep talker its usually just nonsense but occasionally he will tell the full story  on rare occasions  he will even respond to me as if i am part of the dream  its quite hilarious  hes had the past couple of days off work and took the opportunity to enjoy some wine we had  he ended up getting very tipsy and his sleep talking started up while he was awake  he told me a story that i feel like the world  or at least whoever reads this post  needs to know  this will be presented exactly as my husband said it  as closely as i can remember  i now present to you  the lonely aquaman     x   b   so  there was an aquaman  right  he was really lonely  like  really lonely  he was super hot  big  man areolas and a hairy chest  he didnt wear a shirt  he did wear pants though  but he had a big arrow pointing to his dong  he had a trident but it was three dicks  he was so lonely so he went to the fortune teller  she was real sad  she said   youll meet your true love  soon   he met this girl  she had red hair and it just flapped  they were underwater and it just flapped around her face like a spiderweb  it didnt look very good  he said   hey  and she said   hey  how are you    im good  do you want to hold hands   and she was like   yeah   so they held hands  he said   if this is love     and he leaned in real close  their noses were touching   then i dont want it   heeeyahhhh  and he spin kicked that bitch out of the ocean  cause she was trying to steal his gold     x   b   i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did     x   b   edit  my husband is a little embarrassed by the attention  especially considering he does not remember telling the story  ,0

overheard one of my students talk about how much he appreciates me teaching is the only thing i ve ever wanted to do  and while i love my students  this job is exhausting  i m always planning lessons  making the materials for the lessons  grading homework and papers and other assignments  almost all my waking moments are spent exerting energy towards my job and my students  and i walk into my classrooms every single day not knowing if any of it s going to matter   today  i overheard one of my students express his appreciation for me  his tone was so sincere and enthusiastic  and it caught me off guard  my coworkers always mention how teaching is a thankless job  and it s hard to not feel unappreciated when you spend so much time doing things for your kids when they don t pay attention  blow off your assignments  sleep in class  talk over you  and such    it s just nice to know that  at least for one student  what i m doing means something to him    edit  i just want to say thank you to everyone who has commented  i didn t think this post would be seen by so many of you  and i definitely didn t think this post would get so many responses    i want to especially thank all of you for sharing your experiences with your former teachers  it s so heartwarming to read about the educators who inspired you  but it s even more special to know that they re still in your hearts after all this time  we remember how you guys made us feel  too  ,0
i find it interesting how on reddit  where everything is anonymous  people tend to be much more polite  well spoken  and decent than on social media such as facebook or instagram  where all of your personal information is shared with everyone  aside from some glaring exceptions  of course  looking at you  r politics   people tend to be pretty decent here   especially in subs that are specific to a particular subject  when having a discussion on facebook in a similar group  at least in my experience  you find a lot more toxicity    maybe its just the karma system that is keeping people decent  but it sure seems like people would be more careful on social media where your name is on the line  ,0
queens giant hit  bohemian rhapsody  came out in      and to this day is considered a banger  i wonder what current song will be still getting played in    years time that gets everyone as excited as bohemian rhapsody  not a huge fan of the majority of music that is coming out now days and seems to be the new  biggest hit   just thinking  i cannot actually think of   song that is current and will have the same sort of reaction when it is played in    years time like bohemian does   ,0

anyone else feel extremely nervous while posting on reddit  i lose my shit when im trying to post something  i end up putting way too much effort into the title  the post and everything else because i am afraid that people might downvote me and disagree  ok  putting it this way sounds stupid but i think you guys get what i mean   what a time to be alive  im scared because of the darn internet  ,0
did anyone else stalk reddit for a few years before making an account  i was a reddit stalker for what feels like a long time before i decided to make an account   i guess i was afraid to make posts comments or something since i have social anxiety   i still have social anxiety mostly in public  but  i feel like i can almost talk freely like a normal person online now  and having positive interactions on here makes me happy now   it is a weird feeling for me lol    ,0

as a guy  i realized that as you reach your late   s  life can get lonelier if you do not have a girlfriend or pets it is kind of a sad realization  most of your friends would either be busy with work on weekdays  and with their girlfriend or wife on weekends  and you dont get to hang out with them that much  it makes you feel alone and lonely   anyone else felt something like this   edit  slept on it last night  and was amazed to see all the responses  would be a bit mean to say  but am glad that i am not the only one who feels this is true   some key takeaways that i got from the comments below      majority of the people feel lonely in this age range  give or take     but they tend to do something about it or else loneliness really gets to their mind     almost everyone suggested to get a hobby  now i have heard this a lot  but i really did not know where or how to start  until now   one of the comments that i found helpful in this regard was  get three kind of hobbies   one which is for yourself and only serves as your outlet  sketching  gym  etc    one which helps you meets people  and one which gives some sort of secondary income  however small    now again  there might be some personal bias to the way i see it  but i just thought it would be nice to mention it      for people who do not want to get a hobby  social interaction can be overwhelming at times   they usually try to stay inside and play video games  this came out as a common theme     some also suggested volunteering  as it is peaceful  and you get to meet new people     based on the comments below  can confirm that this happens with girls as well     a significant percentage of people are enjoying their time alone in their late   s early   s  a common theme here is that  they get time to do things they want   some comments said that they are still in their late teens  and this post terrifies them  i am really sorry  but i did not intend to do that  you never know  life might turn out interesting for you as you age    will keep on updating the list as i find more gems of wisdom  thank you everyone for sharing    ,0

i introduced an older relative to reddit and i think they got lost in it somewhere because they no longer send me ten texts im a day i was having lunch with an older relative a few weeks ago  they are often complaining about lonliness and the lack of friends to spend time with  since they are sweet and funny and have great stories i suggested a few online communities that might help   yesterday i had lunch again with them and they were intensely enthusiastic about reddit    i suspect ive read a few of their postings because the stories have some familiarity     im glad they have found an outlet   its not just kids here  you guys  ,0

does anyone else here not want a  career   i was wondering if im alone  most of my friends either have this  dream job  they are going for  like a doctor for instance  or they took a high paying job like an accountant and plan to work a lot to maximize their earnings  but then they end up with  more money than they know what to do with    one of my friends own words   nothing wrong with either  but while i used to be in the dream job camp  i had a change of heart in the last year  i asked myself why do i want a distinguished career  i then realized i would like to instead maximize the time i have to peruse my own hobbies and interests so all i want is to work the minimal time i can to earn the money i need to support myself  ,0
forrest gump was released when i was    or     it took me wayyy too long to realize this   as we all know  when forrest gump was giving his speech at the washington monument for his heroic return from the vietnam war  a deranged man unplugged his microphone  rendering the entire oration inaudible    when i was that young  it was just kind of a huge  wtf    moment that i didnt really understand  and i never gave it much thought  honestly  other than surface level   i guess thats just how the war protestors were  shrugs     yesterday  it finally occurred to me that the directors producers writers did that because the vietnam war was such a massively polarising  controversial subject  no matter what forrest gump said on the topic  he would have lost the love from one half of the demographic of the viewers  and the movie worked so well because it was impossible not to love the man  everybody loved forrest gump   by muting his speech  forrest gump was still able to retain the love of the entire audience  no matter which stance they had on the vietnamese war and how passionate they were   pretty brilliant  really  and i might be am probably wrong  but either way  it took me far too long to reach that conclusion    i am not a smart mayunnn  ,0

my dad who loved peter pan peanut butter just passed away  we had people bring jars of it to his service to donate to local food pantries  what started as a little idea has grown  our local news wants to do a story on it and peter pan themselves have reached out to me  it feels good  my dad was the most caring and giving man i know  he would literally give the shirt off his back for anyone  we had over     people come to his calling hours and collected hundreds of jars of peanut butter for homeless people in our area  with more jars still coming to us  its such a great thing to see when it seems like all the main headlines in news today are tragedies  just thought id share this story with you guys   edit  wow  thanks for all the support everyone  in response to some people asking where to send further donations  you can send them to   the mohawk valley community action agency      river road utica  ny        thanks so much to everyone who wishes to donate more peanut butter  this is taking off much more than i ever hoped it would  know a lot of people will benefit greatly from your generosity   ,0

if you ever have russian guests  give them fruit  i have been hosting some russian clients and their families for the past few days  we do full day boat trips in south  a florida and usually provide lavish platters with snacks  cold meats and fruit  i freaked out for a second there thinking the platters where incomplete but after further observation i realised that they where all  from grandmothers to toddlers digging into the fruit platters like there was no tomorrow   i made a friendly comment along the lines of  gee you guys really love my fruit platters  but then one of the adults explained to me that in russia  fruit is outrageously expensive and basically inaccessible to the general population  so when they come to the usa they really love eating fruit    the next few days i made massive platters with mangos and lychees and papaya and all sorts of amazing fruit in great quantities  they showed so much gratitude for that gesture it made me very happy to make them so happy  i just cant imagine being somewhere where you cant afford fruit    and it brings me to my next point  what are things that maybe the general population take for granted but are difficult to get in other places   ,0

happy to help out a stranger in starbucks yesterday morning i m usually a very shy person  but as i was at the local starbucks picking up my mobile order  i heard a young woman trying to leave but who found herself stuck in a conversation with an older creepy guy who was ranting about the government etc   i felt so awful for her because she was obviously so uncomfortable but trying to be polite to him until she could find an out    as a woman who frequently finds herself in the same position  i decided i needed to give her a hand  when i finished putting milk in my coffee i confidently whipped around and walked up next to her with a big smile and said  ready to go   while she was confused i turned to the man and said  i m sorry but we need to get back to work  and then she figured out what i was doing and said  oh yeah it s time  and gave him  a quick wave goodbye    we marched out together and once outside she simply said  thank you  you re a genius  and we exchanged smiles and walked our separate ways   not a big deal but i wanted to share the exchange with someone   hope i made her day a little better   edit  thank you for my first gold      and thank you for silver  ,0

a homeless woman teaches me a lesson  story time  i lived in this crappy duplex right on the street most cities have that splits the nice side of town from the bad side of town  when i moved in there last year  this  i assumed  homeless woman knocked on the door late at night every few days asking for bread or cash or whatever  usually gave her something to eat but i refused when she wanted money   one day she comes by with what looks like the first lawnmower ever made  offers to cut my grass  actually  yes  ill pay you to do that  thats pay for a job  not a sob story handout  so yes  i dont understand how that shitty little mower even worked  but this woman cut the shit out of my yard  its a tiny yard  so when she asked for    bucks i had to think about it  a bit high  but it was my fault for not agreeing to particulars before she did it  and i was trying to reward her for working and not begging  so we worked out a schedule where she would come by every other week  she even cut the neighbors yard  doubling her money    then she stopped coming for a few weeks  turns out her ancient mower was stolen  where was she keeping it  was it even hers    but instead of going back to begging  she pulled weeds and trimmed hedges for various people around the neighborhood  saved up and got a better mower  eventually she had a moped with a ridiculous attachment to drag the mower around town  but the moped and her mower were stolen  again  she went back at it  and soon she started showing up in a rusty old car with an even newer mower in the trunk  she even had a second mower and an  employee  who would cut grass in other neighborhoods  after   or   months of this  i was proud of her for sticking to her plan and seeing it blossom   one night  around      am  i was still up studying for exams and i hear a familiar knock  please dont tell me a third mower was stolen  i open up   shes on foot  looking disheveled  half a bottle of vodka in her hand  im all ready to hear any story she has cooked up  except for the one she actually has   i saw your lights on  i know you studying  figured you might could use a break  its my   th birthday today and i dont have anybody to celebrate with  nobody  you wanna sit on the porch and get drunk with me    so we sat on my porch and got drunk  watched the sunrise and the early risers driving to work  traded stories  laughed about how bitchy my neighbor was  talked about life  without talking about her problems  she asked about mine  and i felt silly telling her my worries   im young  healthy  have a place and a car and a job and people know when my birthday is  im a mid   s white male  and this homeless    year old black lady made me realize how dumb i sound complaining just by asking how i was doing  she hugged me as she left and thanked me for just spending a little time with her   if youre reading this on your smartphone  or sitting at home wondering what you want to eat  or dreading going to work tomorrow in the air conditioning  or rolling your eyes that someone just texted you who you arent crazy about  take a second and appreciate that all of that is luxury  its not your life  its extra  just by virtue of those things you are among the richest     of people on earth  look it up    happy monday  everybody  wherever you are  thanks angie   edit  my first gold  neato  thank you so much   edit    oof ouch owie  my gold cherry  thank you stranger  ive seen dick jokes with more karma on here so it may not be a big deal  but thousands of people around the world getting something positive out of it makes me happy  thanks for the uplifting replies and messages   ,0
this lady smiles at me after a year and it felt really nice  i walk my dog along this path by my house  about half the time  so   or   days a week  i see this middle aged woman who is probably an immigrant from mexico  she has always avoided my gaze and kept a stone expression even though i look at her and put on a friendly smile  i kind of get the impression shes had a traumatic experience with some man because she looks pretty afraid  the past two days shes smiled back but it seemed forced and shaky  today as we passed each other for the second time we made eye contact and the had a big genuine smile on her face  i didnt know how much i actually wanted to see that smile and it made me really happy  ,0
my husband always knows how to cheer me up i had an awful week at work this week  just everything went wrong  then  we had to adult and do taxes and some financial planning stuff  by the end of it  i was just completely mentally exhausted  we went grocery shopping today and he had the biggest grin on his face when we got home  he dug through one of the bags and pulled out my favorite candy  he had somehow slipped it into the cart when i wasnt paying attention and then distracted me during checkout so that i didnt see it  he kept it a secret until we got home  it was so cute and made me smile instantly  what little things does your partner do to cheer you up  ,0
if somebody is rude to you  ask them to repeat themselves  heres why     sorry     excuse me what was that    can you please repeat what you said     in a calm confused tone   they are most likely to either rephrase what they said or say it in a nicer way   most people feel the guilt kick in once they get another chance of repeating what they said before  they get this little feeling of either what is wrong in what i said  or give them a slight realization of wait   there seems to be consequences    this also makes the people around look down on the person that was offensive shifting the focus at them once again l  ,0
 the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth     african proverb i m not sure which sub is appropriate to share this proverb   i definitely relate to it as i spent my early teen years as a middle school pariah  i still feel so alone     years later  i can t help but wonder how my life would ve turned out if i was accepted  embraced  by those around me during my formative years     edit  wow  i definitely didn t realize this post was going to generate as many upvotes and comments as it has  thank you so much everyone  ,0
 wah i suck    omg i suck too  but its okay  were perfect   is the default format of this sub  someone had to fucking say it   this is going to start with a rant  some reality checks  and then some resources  its going to be blunt  harsh  and not pretty  but i dont give a fuck  someone needed to call everyone on their bullshit   most posts on this sub go like this     op posts  im so sad my social skills are bad and have gone into minute detail on everything associated with how theyre bad and what situation im in and talking in circles about the same single point of how my social skills suck     most upvoted comment  dude im the same way but i learned to do absolutely nothing about it and just settle into this subpar life and you should do the same  dont ever take action or actually do the hard shit that makes you any better  youre perfect the way you are fuck those people dont ever sell out  further platitudes of inaction that simply stroke the ego of op and the poster and leave them swimming in a pile of their own self absorbed shit    i swear to fucking god  i want to scream at the top of my lungs at this   why do i care so much     because i was that person for so much of my life     and it amounted to  absolutely nothing    this is going to piss off so many people  but quite frankly  it should  get fucking angry  get angry at me  get angry at everything  and finally    get angry at yourself  get angry for letting all the shit get to you  get angry for letting the world win by keeping you down  get angry for having such a stupidly fragile ego  get angry for never having amounted to anything  maybe after youve finally got all of this tantrum out of your fucking system  youll wipe those baby tears away  and actually do fucking work to become better   here are a few things i always say  in nicer language bc egos  to most posts on this sub      the only person who is observing you so obsessively is   you    you are the only person doing what youre doing  thinking what youre thinking  and feeling what youre feeling   no one else knows any of this  to the same level of granular detail that you do  the more time you spend on this  the bigger your ego grows  building this entire castle of space in your mind about yourself  but remember  youre the only one who has this castle of yourself in your head  i dont care if you keep sitting there telling yourself youre shit  or if you keep sitting there telling yourself youre awesome   when you fill so much of your own thoughtspace with obsessive observations about yourself  youre just inflating your own ego and its fucking worthless      most people simply do not even know you exist  on top of that  most of the people that do simply do not give a flying fuck about you  if this makes you feel bad  check your fucking ego  this is the truth of virtually every person in the world  even celebrities   you think that all of those impoverished developing country citizens who dont have a tv have any idea who will smith is  no  even for a superstar like him  maybe     of the world know anything meaningful about him  so get your head out of your ass  no one gives a fuck about you  besides maybe your family      number   should be liberating  if its not  if it makes you sad  then go lick your fucking wounds and throw another tantrum  you fucking child   a study  https   www sciencedirect com science article pii s                  showed that most people can only have about five close friends at any given time  its actual fucking science  and basic evolutionary biology  youre not fucking special  and thats a good thing  why        gives you the freedom to do everything you want to do  get better at social skills  get better at sports  get better at anything  fail hard  fail often  the people who observe you learning  growing  stumbling  are temporary  and they never really gave a fuck about you in the first place   so fucking put in the work       regardless of who reaps the benefits  someone is putting in work  this is why the  let it happen  advice is fucking terrible  nothing ever  just happens   someone is making a fucking effort  sure you can sit around and wait for someone to put in the effort for you  but whatre the chances of that  put in the fucking effort yourself      fortune favors the brave  and the brave fail  a lot  most entrepreneurs have several failed businesses before they are successful  and guess what  you never knew who they were before they became successful  so be fucking brave  stick your head out  be willing to risk it getting

your fragile little fucking ego to gain anything out of life      you are going to fail  you may fail a lot  and itll hurt  but that doesnt mean you should be stopping  sure  you can stop to keep your ego intact  but what have you gained  more empty platitudes to do nothing about your life  its fucking pathetic  you better get used to failing  the most successful are the ones who were willing to fail the most  theyre the most desensitized  they do it all bc theyre not worried about their fragile little fucking  egos   if you want it bad enough  keep doing it after youve failed  keep learning  keep growing  keep getting better      learn from your mistakes  if you fail  stop and figure out why you failed  if you dont  then its pointless  insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results  switch up the strategy  learn how to get better  dont just sit there and listen to fucking  youre a perfect little snowflake already  platitudes      not everything about learning is pc  sometimes  you will need to understand some shit that people frown upon  and thats okay  seek out what is necessary to learn and grow  so long as youre using any newfound knowledge in an ethical manner  youre good  but for everyones sake  dont just fucking sit there and do nothing about it   thats all i can think of for now  i post these exact themes over and over in this sub  so i figured id just put it all in one  fuck filled post     resources    the charisma myth  charisma on command on youtube  how to win friends and influence people  the subtle art of not giving a f ck

does anyone else oscillate between wanting to be invisible and wishing they weren t so lonely there are periods where i really want to make friends and am encouraged to hang out with people and make small talk  but then there are days when i m really tired and don t have the energy or interest to have quality conversations and i would really just rather keep to myself   after those days when i don t feel like talking or hanging out  having conversations with people feels really awkward and i have a sense of guilt for not having been able to fight through my fatigue in order to talk to them   edit  vacillate not oscillate lol  close enough ,0

do not let your social life or life in general revolve only around one person or you will suffer  it s cool to have a girlfriend a boyfriend or a best  friend anyone you feel close to but no matter how much you love them no matter how much they love you how much of a good person they are  they should still be people that you want in your life rather than people that you need in your life  i know this sounds harsh and i know it s hard to say even for me  but i m not talking in an emotional way but simply talking from my experience    trust me once that person isn t available for you anymore once that person stops talking to you texting you calling you like they used to  once that person starts becoming distant and you can feel that you ain t as close as you were before with these person and realize that you re not as close as you thought you were with this person  that this person doesn t feel the same way you feel for her  once that person isn t here for you anymore   youll feel like pure shit  my point is  people change things change and sometimes you can t blame them but if you re not here for yourself first and preventing yourself from fully enjoying your life by limiting your own happiness and life in general it s sad  you could meet a shit ton of new people and do a shit ton of new activities hobbies  accomplish a lot  but instead you choose to focus too much on someone else  even if it s multiple people you depend on  it stills applies      especially if you are young relationships will come and go really fucking fast don t take things too seriously and don t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and take risks  and just because you want to improve your life doesn t mean you have to start taking everything seriously   i had people that  went from being my bestfriends to simple strangers   life goes on focus on yourself  ,0

  conversational tricks to excite anyone one of the most common problems people struggle with is conversational skills   technology rewires our brains to think in terms of memes  posts  and videos  so we re losing out on real world talk   when you struggle with conversational skills  you feel anxious  creating a downward spiral in where you miss out on the meaningful connection you know you need   here are   antidotes you can use now to make your conversations exciting     number one   the mirror     this trick is so simple that you won t believe it until you try it   when someone finishes saying something  repeat the last     words they said in the exact same way  i ve done this for minutes on end  it s actually hilarious   here s what happens  someone will finish saying something like   yeah so i really want to travel to europe    then you repeat  travel to europe   and instantly the person will go   yeah i wanna   explain reasons here     you can keep doing this until you find something to add onto   why i love it  sometimes i m tired and just want to listen  and this trick let s you do just that  it also cuts through surface level talk and forces people to open up and explain deeper motivations     number two   bold statements      now that you ve got the person opening up  you should be feeling a bit more confident   at this point  you probably are thinking of some questions to ask them  problem  endless questions are so      s   instead of saying   what do you do for work   say   i think you re a doctor    the recipient will go   what    why s that   or  your guess will be right  and you ll blow everyone s minds   then you answer by giving a legitimate reason to back up your statement  for example   you speak in a very formal   articulate manner which reminds me of my doctor    this trick opens up an exciting discussion where you both are operating on a deeper level instead of boring  surface level  what do you do  type questions   note  the statement should be at least slightly accurate  and not come off as  judgy   it should be more fun  and always be a compliment     number three   share the love     put on a smile because you re about to spread some good energy  everyone loves praise  so why not give it out  especially when it s well deserved   if someone is cute  tell them  if someone is hilarious  confess it  you re hurting no one   as i hinted at you can combine the previous trick with this one  example    wow  you re really smart  you must be a doctor or something    say with a smile   the person will blush from happiness  and your guess will either be right and they ll go  omg you re awesome  or they ll go   thank you  i m actually a   job      then you can use the first tip and go   oh you re a   job    and they ll start elaborating about the deeper reasons they chose that profession       now  get out there  this works with everyone  coworkers  family  friends  elevator talks  go try it  ,0
the top   reasons you re probably not funny or entertaining and what you can do about it   this is all based on research from years of studying real conversations and what really funny people do and say  youre not going to think all the examples are funny  but the techniques listed generally work across all humor types and generations  reference at the bottom            you re too literal    literal people are rarely funny  learn how to switch on and off your literal instincts  if a friend asks you what shirt size you wear  you don t have to tell them the exact size at first  instead  you could say   it depends on how many burritos i ate for breakfast   if a girl asks you what cologne you re wearing  you don t need to immediately tell her the name of the cologne  instead  you could play around  and even say   i m not even wearing any  that s my natural scent  i call it  eau de jim     if the printer at work isn t functioning properly  you don t need to stick to literal comments like   the printer isn t working very well   instead  try to be more figurative sometimes  for example   the printer s acting cranky   or  i think the printer is protesting and i m not sure how to meet its demands             you can t laugh at yourself    before you try to make anyone else laugh  you need to be able to laugh at yourself first  you may take yourself too seriously and can t laugh at yourself yet  every interaction is still stressful because you worry too much about making a mistake  it s all the inner filters and second guessing that kills playfulness and humor   once you realize that most people barely ever think about you  and hardly ever care or remember what you do say  you ll open up more  remember  people are thinking about themselves and their own concerns  focus on just having a good time with people and contributing to the conversation   youre not always going to be funny    thats impossible  in fact  the  funny people  in your life strike out a lot more than you realize  we only remember the good jokes they made  and forget all the times they messed up  point is   they keep trying   once you learn to laugh at yourself because you realize that life isn t that serious  you ll have a much easier time making others laugh            you don t give your words fuel    you may say a lot of funny comments  but if you don t support your words with enough nonverbal communication  your words won t be effective  this was my problem for years  i didn t understand why my funny comments weren t getting a good reaction  once i worked on my energy level  articulation  mannerisms  etc   my charisma and ability to make others laugh really took off  i can t emphasize this enough  think of yourself as showing a movie all the time  would people be interested in watching  you  if you were on mute  do you stay still like a statue  do you mumble sometimes  is your energy level too much like toby from the office  your nonverbal skills are     of your social skills   don t ignore them  you can work on them by copying comedians on youtube and taping yourself over and over  imo its the easiest skill to improve and the most impactful            you forget the colorful details    the humor is usually in the details  saying  his breath smelled  bad   isn t nearly as funny as saying  his breath smelled like  beef stroganoff    some words are inherently more interesting than others  possibly because they re less commonly used or unexpected   regardless of the meaning  the phrase  beef stroganoff  just sounds funny by itself  you could substitute  beef stroganoff  with  gorgonzola cheese  or  moldy elderberries  and it would probably still work   instead of telling someone you re a chemistry teacher  try adding a little color to the description  for example   i basically teach kids how to play with poisons             you don t exaggerate enough    this is related to      don t be so literal  i was getting my hair cut the other day and the stylist s hair clipper was particularly loud  i didn t just observe   that s a loud hair clipper   but instead said   i think that s the loudest hair clipper i ve ever heard   it definitely doesn t seem like it would get a laugh  but it did  that was a simple example  but you get the idea  exaggeration   in moderation   is typically the easiest way to get a quick laugh   maybe you re watching a tennis match on tv  saying that someone has a bad serve isn t very fun and won t elicit any laughter  saying   he may have the worst serve in the history of men s tennis   might spark some reaction  or alternatively  remarking   even my three year old nephew can hit the ball harder than that   would be more interesting and playful  saying  i don t really like mushrooms   won t be that entertaining  but rephrasing it by saying something like   i won t go near mushrooms  that s the devil s food  i don t put anything brown and mushy near my mouth   is     x more entertaining            you don t contrast your comments    tap into human psychology  humans are inherently intrigued and entertained by  contrasts   for example  pretend someone asks you how life as a new parent has been  saying   it s been great   won t spark any laughter or smiles  saying   it s been great but i m in a constant state of exhaustion  will definitely get a good reaction  notice that the second example contained a great contrast between two comments  you could add another contrast like   i get woken up a lot and i honestly don t mind that much  but if it was anyone else  i d probably strangle them    commenting   i love all animals   isn t funny on its own  but adding a contrast makes it funny  for example   i love all animals   except llamas  they re disgusting              you don t take advantage of hypotheticals    tap into the human imagination   there s a lot of playfulness and humor possibilities there  for example  you may remark   i ve always wanted to have a home brewery in my basement   which isn t funny on its own  but if you add    except i d probably end up gaining fifty pounds   now that has a chance to be funny because it adds a hypothetical possibility to the equation   instead of stopping at  i love laffy taffy   you could add a hypothetical to your comment    if i had time  i d eat the entire bag right now   you could remark to your spouse   i m going for a run   but make it ten times more entertaining if you added a hypothetical    if i don t come back by    come make sure i m not passed out in a ditch somewhere             you don t know use enough meta comments    meta comments are designed to comment  about  the situation and conversation that youre involved in  i don t have the space to explain further in this post  but here are some examples   that s a nice tie by the way  i figured i d start with a compliment before i asked you for a favor    i probably should have just held the door for you  i m so rude today    i purposely wore my argyle sweater and glasses so you d think i was smarter than i really am    i have no idea why i just sounded like an old british woman just then    next time you meet someone new and they introduce themselves  instead of just stopping at  nice to meet you tom   you could add a meta comment about the situation   i ll probably have to ask you again at least five times because i m terrible at names   and if they laughed at that  you could add   i may even call you jim or steve a few times until i get it right    of course  these tips and techniques were only the tip of the

 can i give you my number   instead of  can i have your number   this is some advice that mostly directed to the guys of this sub    unfortunately  we live in a world where many women have to stay on guard to avoid  for lack of a better term  weird perverts and would be attackers  that is simply a fact  and it needs to be addressed  but this sub isn t for dismantling the patriarchy    so  an indirect issue that arises from this much larger issue is the fact that many guys come across as weird and creepy when trying to flirt  even though it may be completely harmless  and that s why i never ask a girl for her number    instead  i ask if i can give her  my  number    there s a very subtle difference between the two and that difference is giving the woman the power to contact you rather than asking for that power yourself  that way  she can politely accept and then decide later if she would actually like to speak to you again or not  whereas asking  for her  number really puts her on the spot and  if she says yes  removes her sense of distance simply because you can now contact her at will    this is how i go about getting into contact with girls i meet and would like to start getting to know better and i ve found that it generally works a lot more often than asking for their number   edit    first thing s first    rip my dms  now  i ve read through most of the comments and the most common things i see are women saying  yes  i like that approach   and men saying  no  women want you to make the first move     i can t say that i totally understand that argument  if you approach a woman  talk to her for a bit  express interest in talking to her more  and then offer her your number  then i think it s safe to say that you have officially made the first move    there s also a lot of guys saying  she won t text you   and some of the time  that s true  you honestly shouldn t even expect her to text you  but  if she does  then you ll know that she s interested in you    and to everyone obsessed with this  alpha vs beta  mentality    chill  we re humans  not wolves   edit      it s been brought to my attention that wolves also don t follow an alpha structure  i appreciate the education  but you don t have to keep posting links to that adam ruins everything episode   edit    hopefully my last     there are also a lot of guys on here saying  well  she can just say no when i ask her for her number   and to that  i say that youre oblivious to the way the world works    there are many times where men become aggressive and even violent after being rejected and this means that rejecting a man could directly result in a threat arising to the woman  thats unacceptable    a lot of you also say  well  she can just give a fake number if shes worried about that   but what happens when the man in question immediately texts or calls that number while still sitting in front of the woman    and if you dont believe me  thats totally fine  im a stranger on the internet whos provided literally no credentials  which is why you should instead believe peer reviewed studies by actual doctors of psychology whove dedicated their entire lives to researching this subject    rejection  when it hurts men more that it should  https   www psychologytoday com us blog lifetime connections        rejection when it hurts men more it should     males tend to take rejection as a challenge to their masculinity or an insult to their perceived place in the social hierarchy  women are likely to feel emotionally hurt by a rejection and to assume that there is something lacking in them that warranted the rejection or blame the person who did the rejecting but use self soothing to get over the insult rather than lashing out as males might do  women are encouraged to  get over it   but men often feel the need to  get even    and    when a man s pride and sense of self is focused on conquering one particular romantic quest  the need to take action can result in violence    why some men respond to rejection with aggression  https   www psychologytoday com us blog attraction evolved        why some men respond rejection aggression     stratmoen found that those who endorsed the masculine honor ideal were more likely to expect that  a male  would feel insulted and less of a man  when rejected   and to think it appropriate for  a male  to respond aggressively   for example by grabbing the woman s arm or calling her a slut  men tended to endorse masculine honor beliefs more strongly than women  as we might expect   and lastly  if all of that isnt enough  heres a list of  women sharing their experiences of what happened when they rejected men  https   metro co uk            women sharing experiences happened rejected men             so no  a good deal of women dont feel comfortable with openly rejecting men  even in public spaces  nor do they always feel comfortable with giving out fake numbers  but dont just take it from me  a man  instead  look through the comments written  by women  on this post that literally confirm exactly what my sources already stated   oh  and finally  if she  doesnt text you  after you give her your number  then chances are  she wasnt actually interested in the first place  ,0
last night i said fuck it and approached a girl that was gorgeous  bought her a drink and too only find out i m her type  little did i realise that this girl would be interested in me but when you don t let your anxiety take the better of you and try it the results are crazy   morale of the story is honestly just keep telling yourself the opposite of what your mind is telling you and just do it  ,0
youre not alone in feeling alone     percent of millenials say they have  no friends       percent feel lonely    https   www vox com science and health                   millennials poll loneliness  https   www vox com science and health                   millennials poll loneliness       if youre struggling with depression or having a hard time making friends  keep in mind that its not abnormal  its easy to look at social media and wonder why everyone is having fun except for you   but its simply not the case    if youre able to accept that youre struggling and realize its a normal behavior  it will help you to stop beating yourself up so that you can feel better and begin to make progress   edit  since this is getting a lot of attention   if anyone  particularly if theyre male  is feeling down or wants to talk about their issues or simply just wants to be happier theres a great  niche subreddit over at r malementalhealth im not affiliated in anyway  just thought its tangentially related  keep in mind they do not allow any sort of mens rights bullshit  anti feminism  red pill  etc  ,0

the loneliest people are the kindest  the saddest people smile the brightest  the most damaged people are the wisest  all because they dont wish to see anyone else suffer the way they did  unknown what do you think     x   b   source  for the source of this quote  i didnt take it from robin williams but actually took it from a youtube comment  when i searched it up  it didnt have an author for the quote and many sources wrote anonymous as the author  i think the quote  i think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless and they dont want anyone else to feel like that   from robin willaims is much better and realistic than this quote  but maybe the quote could have been inspired by robin williamss quote  ,0

how i got a girlfriend and started making friends with whoever i wanted  eye opening advice  as a kid teenager i was extremely shy and kept to myself but in the past     years things have changed dramatically  it all changed when i received the advice i m about to give you  when it comes to being well liked whether as a friend or a romantic partner the thing that matters way more than anything else is how you make the other person feel about themselves  let me say that again  how you make the other person feel about themselves  it s easy to assume that super outgoing people who are always the center of attention are the people that make the most friends and have the most luck romantically but this does not have to be the case  if you can make someone feel like they are the funniest  most beautiful  most social  etc  they will want to spend time with you think about the people you like the most in your life  they probably make you feel good about yourself  so do the same thing  how  well here s some ways you can achieve this      ask them questions about things they are passionate about  hobbies  relationships  ect     compliments things about them that they clearly care about  they have great hair that looked like it took a while to fix  i m sure they d definitely appreciate you noticing      laugh at their jokes     listen closely to what they say and make it obvious you are listening     say their name occasionally when you are talking to them  basically your goal is to make them feel like you like them and that you think they are awesome  make them feel special  and not in a in genuine kind of way either  every single person has interesting things about them that you can learn about  ,0
if you re a guy take the risk  it s worth it as a guy i definitely believe if you don t try to approach women you ll be single forever  this isn t the case for everyone but in my experience it is  i ve never been approached by a woman in my life  it started with me overthinking every word to say  body language  facial expression  and calculating what was the best possible outcome out of the multiple scenarios i created in my head  i would literally plan my conversations in my head like good icebreakers and as many possible responses i could think of to my icebreakers so when the actual conversation came it would be easier  then when it was time to actually do it i would hesitate and revise my planned conversations  this cycle would just repeat itself until one day i was just like forget it  the worst that can happen is a simple no  few months later of shooting my shots and it hit  you ll feel so much more confident doing this  it also helps with the everyday conversations too   edit  girls shoot your shot too      ,0
do you struggle with social anxiety  go to a concert alone  find a concert near you for one of your favorite bands  preferably music that you have a deep connection to and will be excited to see  take no friends  go completely alone  move through the crowd as you see fit  dance by yourself  and do nothing but focus on your personal enjoyment of the music   putting myself in this anonymous social setting allowed me to explore my social freedom without the fear of judgement  i was no longer worried if my friends thought i was a goofy or bad dancer  once i learned how to enjoy my own company and let loose  people actually started approaching me  that didnt happen when i was all stiff and pent up   people would ask me stuff like  whats the song they are playing   or  have they played such and such yet   it was then a lot easier to spark up convo with these people between sets or songs since they had already broken the ice  guys and girls    so buy a ticket and get out there  you dont even have to talk to anyone  just start by getting out and feeling ok being by yourself   edit    you guys ,0
i feel like i wasted my  prime  years in a depression and being socially anxious    edit  wow  wow  wow  you guys are awesome  thank you so much to each person who took the time to read and reply  i never thought it d blow up  seriously   i m in bed and reading every one of these replies and feeling heard and supported is a good feeling    to everyone who says they can relate and that they are in the same boat  i hope that you keep healing and that your journey takes you to lighter places  sometimes the internet isn t a bad place  thank you      also  thank you for the volunteer suggestions  i ll be looking into it        i feel like i wasted my  prime  years in a major depression  i ve struggled with depression and social anxiety for nearly all of my life but the peak of it was from about    to around     i don t know how to reclaim a social life  i understand not everyone peaks high school or college  but i just feel like i fucking missed out   i went to public school for all my life besides my last two years of high school  when i transferred to an incredibly small private school  the choice of transfer was because my anxiety became crippling and i turned to religion to try and ease my problems and to be in a smaller setting  ultimately this choice put me in a position where i lost all of my old friends from public school  who were  popular girls   and my depression spiraled to the point of daily suicidal ideation  i became suicidal without a solid plan  my parents divorced  and i eventually moved out of my house after being physically assaulted by my parent    i spent most of these years        working and making extremely weak attempts to complete school  i took two gap years after high school and still have yet to make a real dent towards getting my degree   my problem is that now  as i am finally trying to move past suicidal thoughts and depression  and i feel like i have no  place  and no idea how to be social  i would have absolutely nothing to talk about if i tried to make new friends  which is difficult because i live in a small community     the time that most people use to fall in love  discover themselves  travel  make lifelong friendships and have the best experiences of their lives  i barely made any real progress in my life as i trudged along and went back and forth on if i d commit suicide or not  most girls are pretty  kind  social  fun  and popular   and that intimidates me  one of the worst parts about all of this  is that this isn t something you share with people  it s not easy to explain to new people why you don t have any friends  and perhaps most importantly  i feel this incredible shame about not being a fun person  i desperately want meaningful relationships but i don t know how to calm the fuck down and i worry about rejection  or being  weird   i have severe body dysmorphia  social anxiety  and don t drink   i want to believe that i will have friends again someday  that the feeling that i don t belong will go away someday  and that i will fall in love and have a healthy relationship  i just don t know where to begin or if others will find me worth it or not     also  in case it is asked  i have been for years and am in therapy  and was on antidepressants for half a year however a major side effect was worsening anxiety  ,0

why do some people feel the need to comment on how someone is shy or more quiet than others in a public  i get that comment at work all the time and i m a nurse  like brah leave me alone   i do my job just fine  i ve accepted i m more quiet and have a smaller social circle and i m fine with it  just bc i m not outgoing and loud like you doesn t mean you have to point that out in a group setting  that just makes me more a little insecure and less confident at work like that s not a compliment in this extroverted world and makes everyone uncomfortable      edit  omg thank u for all the comments and karma i just woke up and saw   glad people can relate   i understand most people are just making an observation and r being friendly are uncomfortable  can t help how we feel though  i feel like everyone knows being the  quiet one  and not talking in group settings isn t exactly the  social norm  so you re basically pointing out someone s weird in front of everyone lol  why not just directly add them to the convo or talk to them one on one  idk            i go to work tonight and we ll see if i have to give report to the guy who says this all the time   i m glad this is a topic people have something to say on and i love readings everyone s different perspectives   ,0
life is disproportionately unfair to people who have been raised by bad parents  anyone who was raised by either one or two toxic parents knows what i m talking about  children watch their toxic parent do and say offensive things  and they copy those offensive behaviors because they don t know any better  parents are supposed to be our role models  and if we don t see anybody attempting to correct a toxic parent s behavior or literally do anything to stand up to the toxic parent  then we begin to think that the way the toxic parent acts is how we re supposed to act  children who are raised by toxic parent s  often end up isolated because their parent s  taught them toxic behaviors instead of how to make meaningful connections with other people   then the person who had a toxic upbringing enters the real world  and it beats them down for having a toxic upbringing  these people have missed out on valuable social lessons  and were instead taught toxicity  so they wouldn t know the appropriate things to do in social situations  teachers  bosses  and every other person who s supposed to serve as guidance will be quick to criticize the person for their toxic behaviors  yet they ll refuse to offer any tips to the person with the toxic upbringing on how to act better  instead telling them   figure it out for yourself     society pushes you in the water and you ll have to either sink or swim   so the next time you encounter a rude person  try not to be too hard on them  there is a possibility that they re just an unpleasant person without a conscious  but it s just as likely that they re a normal person who came from an unfortunate upbringing and just doesn t know any better  ,0

every time you stay silent out of fear that youll be rejected for who you are and what you believe  youre missing the opportunity to connect with someone  so please just open up your goddamn mouth and say something     x   b   sincerely   someone who loves you very much  who had to leave because you were too afraid to share       edit to add   being raised in a family that did not connect with me emotionally  respect my boundaries  or attend to my needs left me unable to connect with folks as i was growing up  considering that i m    now  i ve spent the majority of my life believing that people didn t want me around  it s just something i believed because it s what i was taught by my family   when i was     i dated a guy who was so incredibly disrespectful to me  but i didn t leave until he ended it  i was devastated  not because we were broken up but because    i felt so alone and    i didn t stick up for myself all the times he disrespected me   i said to myself then  i don t know why i am like this  but i am never going to stay around somebody who treats me like that ever again  i didn t know this at the time  but that was my self worth shining through  something in me realized  i need to give myself the care and love that i desperately craved as a child not because i m alone and i m the only one who can  but because  i deserve care and love all the time   and if that s true then i need to learn to get it when nobody is around to give it to me  ie from myself   and that s when i began to explore my childhood     years later and i am inviting myself to things  i am saying what i want and i usually get it  because it turns out there are billions of people on this planet and several of them are more than happy to give me what i want  including myself   when someone disrespects me  i know it s undeserved  when i have something to say  i m less worried about criticism and more worried about who s got something to say back   i have friends  i have a community  i have a home in my own body    when i met this girl  i felt she could be part of that community  unfortunately  our communication styles are different  but a large part of what kept us from connecting is  she wouldn t speak up  she was scared  i get it  this is scary work  i am still working and it s been   years   it just sucks ass  and the worst part is that as much ass as this sucks for me  i m not the only missed connection she s had or that she will have until she learns that speaking up isn t about being liked  but about finding the people who genuinely accept you  i can t accept her because she isn t giving me anything to accept    so i had to let it go    in a way  walking away is accepting her  accepting her inability to work on that fear right now    i hope she just learns to talk and doesn t keep missing out  ,0
remember that other people get social anxiety around  you   for some of you this may be a little hard to believe  but you do represent other people to other people  there are people on this very sub who are asking questions about how to talk to you  how to position their body language relative to you  how much eye contact to make with you  and how to get you to be friends with them   remember this when you feel socially awkward  i can tell you from the experience of being all over the spectrum   ive been popular  charming  awkward  lonely  and everything in between   that confidence and good social skills is a massive game of pretend   i remember going to a party in university once and looking around  seeing the clumps of people  and i realized  everyone is nervous   nobody knows what to do  not only that  but ive always been of the strange assumption that everybody knows each other except for me  not true  everybody just clumps to who they know   when you realize that everyone is nervous    you realize that  you can just be the confident one   people will assume youre the real deal   honestly  and then you become it  in short order  you just go up to a clump of people and say  hey  just wanted to come say hi to you guys  are you having a good day so far        now imagine the roles are reversed and someone walks up to you like that  assuming theyre smiling and being polite  you have tons of respect for their courage  you see them as  seriously  confident  it always works that way     tl dr   try it out for yourself  instead of asking or worrying about how to talk with someone or get them to like you     just be the person that the other people are asking about   theres no formal audition  you just play the role  just do it  its very easy   may you experience great friendships and happiness   brent ,0
advice  dont exaggerate emotions youre feeling  hoping someone will notice im posting this as someone who is guilty of it from time to time but its really cringy and a bad habit  dont sulk visibly when youre sad  for attention  dont smirk to no one  obviously  hoping someone will ask what youre smiling about  dont laugh loudly out of nowhere to make people stare  dont stare dramatically and longingly at your crush  waiting for them to catch you  let your emotions flow through your actions and behavior naturally  dont perform them like a character in a show  it just comes off childish at best and really creepy at worst  its a bad habit that people who are socially unaware tend to do and i understand the logic behind it but every attempt ive seen of it is always  always so so cringy so be careful if you catch yourself doing it  the fact that youre doing this is actually probably a sign that youre feeling lonely and that your feelings are being ignored by those around you so you feel the need to overexpress them for attention rather than communicate them in a less ridiculous way  so consider venting to someone privately instead  ,0
anyone else dread  re opening   i kind of like the quietude  the empty streets  emails instead of meetings  zoom get togethers  working from home  wearing the same shirt for    days in a row  empty stores except for the   people gingerly trying to avoid each other  etc   its also nice to not have so much sports in the news  but instead have heroic acts of healthcare workers and the average person down the street   it seems like a lot of people cant wait to  crank it up again    now its becoming summer and time for noisy celebrations  traffic  sports events  parties  big group celebrations and concerts and seemingly everyone cant wait to get  back to normal    i wish we could stay quiet  stay small  stay alone  stay unglamorous  stay spiritual instead of big  loud  messy and competitive     how are you doing with the prospects of returning to  normal   ,0
if you feel like you re losing control over your life  try this  pick one thing you ve been avoiding and force yourself to do it  you ll be amazed at how quickly the sense of confidence  agency  and power returns to you  it can be anything from       cleaning up your room   sending that text   calling that person up   responding to that email   picking up that book   writing that letter   signing up for that course   walking into the gym   etc   it s going to be hard as hell  that s built up mental resistance  but trust me  once you push through it  the other side is bliss    the door is already open  you just have to walk through it  ,0

does anyone else randomly have days where they re super confident for no reason  but most of the days are helplessly shy and antisocial  what i hate the most is some days i have no clue why  but i wake up feeling talkative  extremely confident  not a fear or doubt in the world   then the next day i m back to being shy and not confident at all   sometimes it makes things weird because i have a good time with certain people  and they think i m outgoing but then suddenly i m not and they probably think i m being an a hole when i just don t feel like talking ,0
i just got a tip for all y all guys struggling with dating  so many guys make it their main goal to not act awkward  this takes away their confidence and restricts there personality  confidence is the number one priority and holding back your personality shows a lack of confidence even if you aren t being akward  if you take risks and try and be outgoing despite acting awkward  girls will like that way better because it makes you come off like you re trying and you re at least confident enough to take risks   edit  holy fucking shit i ve never gotten this many upvotes goddaaaaaaaaamn it s prolly cuz this is jus straight facts   ,0
no one wished me a happy birthday today hello everyone  today is my   st birthday and nobody wished me for almost like   years  i have tried to make friends as much as possible  however  the friendship just dies away after a year or two  i am feeling down because even my closest friends did not wish me  i had wished them when it was their birthday  i also tried to make friends and build friends as much as possible  but  it was a failure  to be honest  even my family members did not wish me until i reminded them   until now  reddit is the best place for me because i can talk to people from all over the globe and most of them are nice  if you were like me in the past  please do suggest tips to make friends in a university  by the way  i am a bit introverted but always open to new people and ideas  how do i sustain a good friendship  i had lots of toxic friendship before  in fact  i think most of them were  thanks  people and have a nice day ahead      edit    i had to ask my friends to wish me for my past birthday  i feel kinda worthless and was looking at my phone if anyone had wished me  but none did so     edit    thanks  everyone   edit    damn  i did not expect     more people wishing me birthday  i feel blessed and its my first time in life hundreds of people wishing me  i will definitely try to answer every comment as much as i can  anyways  i have collected some meaningful advice if anyone is having the same problem as me  i will add more if i can       u alwaysforscuba  i like to look at my birthdays as a chance to open a new chapter  find a new hobby  learn a skill  join a club  you dont need to be friends with everyone you meet there  but itll give you the opportunity to widen your social circle if you want to   you dont need to be extroverted to be liked  one of my favorite people hardly says anything in a group situation  but he listens  smiles  and contributes when he feels like it  thats far preferable to someone dominating the conversation      u fuckingfeduplmao   if it makes you feel better  i ve had the same happen to me  my birthday is between christmas and new year  so i get it s a foggy time for people  but it s happened with four of my supposed  best friends  over the years  i now use it as a judge of friendship    as for making friends at university  the biggest thing that helped me socialize was cheerleading  i loved it so much that i ran for a committee in my second year  everyone was so supportive  i had a lot of fun learning to stunt  and competitions were amazing  i even went to croatia with them for a week for a spring break style holiday   ever since i ve always said join a club or society if you can  whether it s something you have a passion for or something you re interested in  give it a go  you won t be the only introvert there  and you might not settle straight away  but you re surrounded by people who    are in your situation and    have similar interests  i made more friends through societies than i ever did on my course  ,0
anyone else feel sometimes that they are the least important friend in a group and their absence would make no difference to the others  edit   thank you all for your responses  i realise that i have to start looking out for myself first  i dont have to have many people in my life to be happy  i have to start being happy with myself  also a smaller friend circle would be better because truthfully  it is not the quantity of friends  but the quality  ,0
does anybody else hate saying bye at social functions and just sneak out unnoticed  at social gatherings i hate saying bye when i have to leave and usually sneak out like a ninja  the awkward part is saying bye to people i dont know  i dont mind saying bye to the host or friends that i know  the weird and awkward part is how to acknowledge the people i dont know  i feel like a d bag for being introverted and not introducing myself to everybody  i dont want to pull away my friends from the conversation circles theyre in wih people i dont know just to say bye then not acknowledge the person theyre talking to   is there a better way to say bye in these situations  should i just say bye to the people i do know and not really mind the other people who i dont know  ,0
girls  if a guy approaches you and bombs  please dont laugh at him    i work at a grocery store and i saw a group of girls walking down the aisle i was working on  they seemed about the same age as me  college  just when a slightly older  nerdy looking dude walked up to them wearing a playstation shirt and asked them if they like playing  insert game name ive never heard of   he seemed nervous and stammered a bit but at least he tried  but the girls said no and burst out laughing  poor dude then tells one of the girls shes cute and they all start laughing even harder  and then look at me as if i was gonna laugh too  look  i know it wasnt the best conversation starter but dont be assholes  it takes effort to walk up to someone and talk about something  just be polite and get on with your day  i feel for the guy  because that prolly made him super anxious and he might still be thinking about it    ,0
i m a girl and i told a guy he s cute i basically texted him saying i think he s cute    honestly  it gave me a bit of an adrenaline rush  but i m glad i did it    he basically responded a few days later  he s very studious and we re not close  and said he finds me pretty cool  but i m not looking for a relationship    i responded with i m cool with that and i just wanted you to know that you re cute    i m glad i told him because i m stepping out of my comfort zone and loving myself more    i hope everyone does the same too even if they are rejected    edit  thank you for silver   i never expected anyone to look at this post  ,0
if there are three people in your conversation  but it s dominated by two people  still make occasional eye contact with the person who isn t talking it s a simple way of letting them know that they re still part of the group and makes it less likely that they ll feel unwanted in the conversation   edit  some people are saying that you can simply ask their opinion  do it  i am just saying that this is how i have felt valued in the past when  say  two of my friends have gone on a bit of a tangent talking about something that they both have in common that i don t  ,0
stop chasing people  do this instead      chase all around excellence    set short and long term goals to become the best version of yourself  strive to be better daily in all areas of your life  people will be naturally drawn to you if you have drive and ambition  why   you will project confidence and demonstrate high value  you will not be taken for granted  instead  you will be a force to be reckoned with     chasing people is a failed endeavor    you will naturally put them on a pedestal  you will always get emotionally attached  you will always seek their validation  even if they really are not qualified to give it to you   you will be needy and inconsiderate of their lives  you force them to look down upon you  worst of all  you will never truly understand them as the human beings they are  to paraphrase atticus finch from  to kill a mockingbird     you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view    until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it     thus  tl dr take everybody else off that pedestal  and put yourself on that pedestal  value yourself and chase excellence   treat others as part  not the center  of your life  if you do this  i guarantee you that your social life will naturally improve   edit  i should mention that you can certainly value other people while chasing excellence  but see them for the human beings they are  not the flawless creatures they arent  ,0
had a deep talk with a random girl on snapchat it s actually unbelievable  i m actually socially awkward and not the best when it comes to starting a conversation  but today something changed   i had my eye on a cute girl on sc  and she posted a picture of a watermelon  and i reacted to her story which she found funny  from there we started deep talking   hours long  the conversation went from joking to relationship to sex and then to her personal life    and the best part is she made the first move and asked me that we should hang out   she s completely out of my league and i hope she doesn t flake on me  i will keep you updated      edit  thank you everyone for your kind words  ,0
i just discovered something about smiling  thought id share  hi all  im new here  ive been browsing around and i really like this community  i thought id share something i just discovered    hopefully it might be useful  or at least interesting  to someone else here   i think im a decent looking guy  but ive never liked my smile  it distorts my face in a way i dont like at all    it reminds me of robert deniros somewhat creepy smile  now that so much of my social life is via zoom and skype  due to covid      i see my own face a lot more than usual  i hadnt realized how much ive trained myself not to smile  and then for some reason i thought  what the hell  try an experiment  just let myself smile  creepy or not  to my amazement nobody recoiled in horror  in fact  they reacted with smiles of their own  and my conversations became smoother and more enjoyable  i think i learned two things  first  others might see me completely differently than i see myself  second  i should be bolder and try to experiment  to do something different socially    im amazed im just learning this at age     anyway  im not sure if this helps anyone  but i thought id share it  ,0
the longer i dont reach out to someone to talk  the guiltier i feel  and the guiltier i feel  the longer i dont reach out to them  anyone else often get trapped in this unhealthy cycle  i would say the majority of the guilt comes from the assumption that they think i am a bad friend or that i dont care about them  i feel like it would be hard and confusing to try to explain the real reason to them  this is something ive been trying to work on as of late  ,0
anyone else lost their personality  two years ago  i had an amazing friend group  i had a girlfriend  i had a close best friend  i had a friend who felt like a brother   and a few other really good friends  i created memories with them all the time  i had a very distinct personality  i was fun  bold  charismatic  daring    i also had depression though  and it led me to eventually isolate myself  now i am essentially friendless  i met a person online two months ago from my city  we ll be hanging out after this situation  and i guess i am worried that i will have nothing to show  that i ll just be dull  boring  you kinda lose yourself when you spend so much time in your thoughts  alone  forget who you are  what you re like  i remember having a voice chat for hours with someone from reddit  and it felt so liberating to think  wow  this is me  after i had forgotten because i hadn t had any human to share myself with    i m just worried is all  i lost myself  i think  and i m not sure to what extent i ll get it back  i wanna be as whole as i was two years ago  ,0
if someone in a group interrupts you  give them   chances to not cut you off  the first   times  just speak purposefully louder   with conviction  and if they keep going   dont care  then the  rd time  you have enough leverage to put them on the spot and call out the fact that theyre being rude  it sounds kind of manipulative  but as the introvert  you need to learn how to play the social game and this is what worked for me  if someone does something   times  its become a confirmed pattern  so the other person is in check mate  they cant use plausible deniability to interrupt you  you also gave them   chances to not be the asshole by being subtle but obvious enough to indicate that youre still speaking  without calling them out publically  but once they keep repeating it  put them on blast  trust me  theyll become the asshole if they dont make sure not to interrupt you next time  everyone else in the group will respect you and not interrupt you the next time because theyre like  damn im not going to be the asshole by interrupting them  since they already set that boundary   if no one in the group cares when you make the statement  then leave that group  a group has to be a certain level of shitty for this not to work   what do you say when you interrupt them  just sternly say  im not finished talking  and look at them  then act like nothing happened and keep talking  dont do it in an angry voice  just a stern but calm tone  ,0
does anyone else feel like they ve always been the  less important  friend  i    f  have always struggled with friendships and socializing  sometimes  i d get so panicky when telling a story to a group of people   even to friends   that i could feel my face burning in embarrassment  i m always wondering what people think about me  i hate my birthdays because i get anxious about who will be there at the event and people normally don t pay much attention to it anyway  i was always the friend who had to walk in the back when the sidewalk got too narrow to fit   people  know what i mean  i always think that people see me as a loser and talk to me only because they feel sorry  even the friends who i speak with for years   i ve had some bad experiences with friends who turn out to treat me with disrespect  belittling me  these memories always come back to me on a regular basis  then i feel just as bad as i did when it happened   how can i change this horrible mindset and start having real connections with people   does anyone else relate to this   ,0
all my life i thought i was an introvert when in reality i was an extrovert who got used to functioning alone  i always thought i had no energy to socialize when in reality i had no energy because i wasnt socializing i seriously crave positive social interaction now  it feels amazing  like fucking heroin  i cant fucking live without it now  i feel as if many people are also like me  who were rejected all thier life and dont realize how much better their life could be sharing it with other people ,0
can we stop pushing  i asked x out  to the top constantly  ive only been subbed for a week now but this is getting annoying really fast  theres plenty of good stuff in here but the low effort  no lesson  no explanation posts that frequently reach my frontpage are not doing this place a service            yes i get it  it is a big deal to ask someone out  actually it shouldnt be though  but theres more to social interactions than asking somebody out    ,0
stop idolizing someone who doesnt like you back  how exactly do you get over a crush that isnt reciprocal   so ive been thirsting over this girl i knew back in high school on facebook  commenting on her pictures via dm but nothing more  shes seen the comments but leaves them on read  never bothering to reply back  i really dont like using dms for conversation but thats all ive got to reach her   so long story short  i decided to go cold turkey on the girl  unfollowing her feed and not writing anything to her  i did this for myself more than out of spite   to which i dont think shell care either way lol  but thats beside the point  but in order for me to move on from this pedestal ive built for her  im just going to not pay any more attention to her   i feel this is an effective tool against defeating idolization  out of mind and out of sight  also  and more importantly  this person is just like anyone else  theres nothing special about her outside of my own warped idealized version of her that lives inside my head  i had to remind myself of that  and thats helped tremendously in putting her back into the mundane fold of cards   i think its very important to note that its not okay to hate someone because they dont like you back  you just got to erase that perfect image of them out of mind  i cant tell you how crucial that notion has helped me get over alot of past relationships   crushes dont put themselves on pedestals  we do  so nows the time ive moved on to greener pastures and leave the pedestal behind   p s  i wrote this because writing things down help me solidify my actions more fluidly than just thinking or talking about them  i hope whoever reads this feels similar and i wish you all the luck with own your quest in defeating the dreaded pedestal of idolization  ,0
does anyone else feel like an extrovert inside a socially anxious persons body  the idea of being the life of a party  spending hours a day hanging out with people  and being able to meet a lot of new people really appeals to me  but when im actually in social situations i just feel anxious stressed and dont really talk to anyone  it sucks  i dont know if im an extrovert or not  i am usually tired out when around my family or strangers  but i dont really notice my energy level when around friends  but i think i easily could be  especially if i had good social skills  ,0

cashier made small talk so easy  here s how she did it  she smiled said   hello   while scanning my items   she saw the dream catcher on my keychain and pointed it out about how she liked it and how she had one shaped like a heart that she lost    i looked up as she was talking to thank her and hope she finds her dream catcher one day and then i saw she had a tears for fears pin on her vest    i told her i really liked her pin and that she should check out this local bar i know of that occasionally hosts a tears for fears night and other bands from the    s    it was a brief exchange  about   minutes but it felt strangely fulfilling after  and all she did was point out the smallest thing like my keychain to break the ice and get the ball rolling  i m going to start using her tactic more often  ,0
   m  i wasted my entire childhood being the good kid studying hard  what is left of me is a socially inept suicidal husk of a human being  please help me  i have had some tough years behind me and i can honestly say that my depression has reached its deepest point ever   i feel lost in life  i feel lonely  ever since february i have cried myself to sleep every single night   it all started when i skipped a grade  i was placed in a class full of people     years older than me and they didnt understand me or connect with me  so i was a hermit ever since i was like    i never learnt how to properly socialise and that was a death sentence  add to this that i have pretty autistic traits  though i have never been tested  and you have a socially inept loser   my grades were good though so when i went to middle school i could maximize at least that potential  still  i fucked up badly with people  my humour was too childish for their taste and i was honestly just a weird little kid that nobody wanted to interact with  but when i went to high school it really started to affect my confidence  this was supposed to be a time full of parties  exploring sexuality  having fun  nothing came of that  and i spent my time the same way i did in middle school  in my room  alone   when i went to university i thought that this would be my time to shine  finally i will lose my virginity  finally i will visit cool parties  finally i will have girls show interest in me  finally people will no longer ignore me  boy was i wrong  dead  dead wrong   now i am about to wrap up my masters  i am still the same person  even though i spent years trying to self improve  braces  getting a good haircut  getting better fitting clothes  sporting working out     times a week  nothing came of it  nothing  no girls interested in me still  nobody understanding me still  no close group of people to hang out with   i wish i werent a good kid  i have become boring and socially inept  nobody wants me  i never sneaked out  i never stole anything  i never went against the rules  i never went crazy for   night  i never dared to go out of my comfort zone  i thought that one day people would see the good in me and be in awe  instead they reject me for the pathetic excuse of a guy i am because i am boring  i deluded myself into thinking being nice will give me a good life  but its honestly just abuse telling anyone so   i dont know how to make people laugh  i can not for the life of me get people to get my jokes  i can not get a person to truly listen to me  i do not know how to hang out with anyone  i do not know how to talk to girls  let alone get a relationship or hook up with one  it sucks so much when i get to interact sporadically with socially active people and they talk about their adventures like its nothing  oh lets do a sex point system    point for oral    points for fucking a sorority girl    points for a threesome    as if it is nothing at all   i am thinking about booking an escort soon and then maybe ending it all  i feel like i can not be fixed  i feel like i have exhausted all my options  i am not confident enough to change it  if only i had a good childhood with sex and breaking rules innocently and learning how to behave like a normal    year old  maybe i would not be here  maybe then i would be confident  all i have waiting for me is the stress of working through a phd like a lonely pathetic hermit and then hopefully making enough money for prostitution and copes  how do i change  i see no light at the end of the tunnel  and i cannot improve my looks or anything further  how do i move forward   for once in my miserable life i want to feel    human     tldr   i am possibly autistic  spent my entire life worrying only about studying  now i have nothing going for me any more  all i see around me is people making it in life while i slowly degrade   edit  obligatory this blew up  i am almost unable to work through every comment  but i am really thankful this many people took time out of their days to give their thoughts  its all very much appreciated   edit   i promise that i read every single comment in this thread  its amazing how much support i got  unfortunately i do not know what to next  as not everything has yet opened up and summer break is around the corner which for me is the time where i see the least people except the same    people at the pool  i will see what i can do but i cannot promise myself any major improvements right now  ,0
become someone you d want to be around  once upon a time  i was a very anxious girl  i wasn t a part of the group and knew it  i d never been  so i was constantly aware of the fact  even when i was walking the hallways in school  i was afraid of how i might look to other people  why is she walking alone  why isn t she with her friends  doesn t she have any   i didn t have any   even when i was talking to others  i was afraid of what they might think of me  what impression was i making  did they already know i didn t have any friends  i was so caught up in my own misery i didn t know how to escape it  it seemed impossible to me   today  i wouldn t recognise this girl if she knocked on my door  i love being around people  i love meeting new people  i enjoy making small talk with strangers  i still often walk hallways alone  but i don t overthink it  i can still get anxious about stupid things  but try to recognise and get over it  what changed   back then  i was incredibly focused on myself  when i was talking to someone  i wasn t trying to get to know them  i was trying to see myself from their point of view  i was convinced it was already negative  so it became negative   what i wanted from people was not to get to know them  to have a real  equal relationship with them  but for them to accept me  who they were  i didn t really care   so why would they want to be friends with me  what did i have to offer  a charity case   before you try to become more  popular  or  accepted   figure out who you are  not in full  because we re all a work in progress  but the basics  where your values lie  what you enjoy  who you want to be around  then  become confident in yourself  that can be tricky at first  without anyone to validate you  but try  if you re obviously not confident in yourself  why would anyone believe you re fun to be around  put yourself in uncomfortable situations  because that s the only way you ll grow   then  become someone you d want to be around  listen to the people you re talking to and think of what they might want  make eye contact with others and smile at them  be genuine  get out of your head  ,0

does anyone else prefer texting sometimes because you can think about what you re going to say and read it back before sending it which prevents you from waffling something that just comes off the top of your head  i often find myself sounding more like i know what i m talking about when texting instead of face to face conversations because i m not under as much pressure to keep a conversation flowing and i can see review what i m about to say before sending it  unlike in real life conversations where i can t prepare structure a response as clearly in my mind before saying it out loud   i was wondering if i m just the only one and if anyone else deals with this in a different way that i could catch on to  ,0
 stop trying to be someone youre not  is shitty advice  basically  im a quiet person who no longer wants to be a quiet person  thus  i googled searched for how to change that in this subreddit  i found a lot of threads created by people like me who wanted to stop being quiet  and a lot of the  advice  given was to just accept that youre quiet and that its just a part of you that you cant change  ive seen comments saying  stop trying to be someone youre not   this is horrible advice  no one tells a couch potato to  just accept being how you are  when they express that they want to change themselves and get fit  no  they may not be naturally athletic  but that doesnt mean they cant learn a sport or run a race    you have two options when it comes to something you dont like about yourself  you can accept it or you can change it  neither one is bad as long as it makes you happy  but please  stop discouraging people who want to change themselves  deliberately changing yourself isnt a bad thing  working to become who you want to be isnt a bad thing  and to everyone who wants to change  stop listening to the people who say you cant   edit  wow  this blew up    just to clarify   stop trying to be someone youre not  is good advice if youre not being true to yourself because youre trying to change for  other people  or youre trying to impress  other people   but if youre trying to change for yourself  nothing wrong with that  dont discourage people who want to change for themselves and no one else  ,0

here are some socially crippling mindsets to avoid       never interpret neutral statements as negative    you will fuck yourself over by coming off as insecure  ruining friendships relationships  and pushing people away  interpret them positively and you will come off as confident and life will just be more pleasant  if it was negative and you interpreted it positively  then the person who was trying to get to you either looks or feels like an asshole         never assume what someone wants or doesnt want    always ask directly  or at least indirectly but in a way that you will get a confirmation about your assumption  assuming makes an ass out of you and me  a lot of times people make assumptions in order to maintain the same comfortable dynamic  but in turn  they alienate the person  what can end up happening is you assume something about someone  then they assume something about you making that assumption  and then you end up having a childish argument and you can even end up losing a friendship or relationship         never assume that someone is out to fuck you over    put away the ego and paranoia  yes  have boundaries to protect yourself  recognize red flags and exercise caution  and know how to slowly open up and test the waters rather than just divulge everything  but if you to try and do this ninja mind reading shit  youre wasting your time  if someone didnt do an action to directly fuck you over  you cannot have this mindset if you want to be successful  but  if someone makes a mistake twice or more  preferably the first time you set a boundary  and the second time theyre out   thats when you know and can either break it off  or work on the situation because they bring you more positives than negatives          never assume that  this is how friendships relationships work  so this is how i need to act with everyone     you will ruin many good friendships relationships this way  every single dynamic is different  as long as youre mature on your end  and the other person brings more positives than negatives to your life  youre good  sometimes  you will have to put aside your ego while the other person has a tantrum and be patient  other times  they might  as long as they dont cross boundaries and they offer more benefit to your life  why care what people think  this is an extreme case  but its why i cant judge poly amorous people  or people who have close friends who may have been toxic in the past  people change and what works for you  may not seem  cool  to someone else  but if you get what you want out of it  who gives a shit  the only people judging you are unhappy  ignorant  or insecure people  you dont see bill gates posting comments on youtube saying  omg what a beta cuck  or  what losers   theres a reason for it  hes living his best life  stop letting people define shit for you   the only exception to this rule is when you have serious issues that havent been dealt with  in which case  yes  maybe you should let go of that friendship relationship and work on yourself  ex  codependency    ,0
always read positivity in someones statements until they make it obvious that they have negative intentions  any other way of interpreting a situation will make you insecure   some people will socially test you or put you on the spot in groups by throwing ambiguous statements at you just to see how secure or confident you are in how you interpret it   for example  when someone replies to you  k  or  ok   do you automatically assume theyre in a bad mood  dont  ill admit that it is a bit shitty or annoying for someone to throw an ambiguous statement at you thats hard to read  but thats why its even more important to read it positively until they themselves comes out as being salty  if that were the case  even then  tjem being passive aggresive is their own issue  not yours  ,0
i am the most comfortable talking to people i dislike  i have realized that i if i like someone  i would hide my personality because i think showing no personality is better than showing a personality that the person i like might hate  i always thought that i do not have anything to say  that i am silent because i dont know what to say or how to say it  but i have figured it out  the reason why i dont say anything because i am too busy thinking if should say something  i am too busy thinking of what i should say  too busy thinking if someone would dislike my personality because i said such thing  if someone would not like my joke  or if someone would find me stupid    i got it all wrong  small talk should not be thought of that much  i shouldnt think of what im gonna say not saying you shouldnt give a fuck at all  but just saying what comes on your mind without caring what the person in front of you would react     i found this because i talked to a lot of people i hated  and when i talk to someone i hate  i dont give a fuck what he thinks of me  so i realized im my realest personality when im talking to someone i dont like     i still have the problem of caring what others say  but i have been using a really awful but working method of pulling up things i hate about a person  making me hate him and not care a bit about him  this is an awful method but it has helped me a lot  and its making me a lot better at talking to people    ,0
anyone often feel lonely and then try to talk to people but then realize talking to people isn t that great  like sometimes i find myself randomly wanting to talk to someone but when i do make the effort to  i then realize i don t like talking to my conversation partner s  because the conversations are really boring or just uncomfortable to be in  even when trying to steer the conversation to be more interesting or trying to ask them more  or even when the other person tries to  it seems like the conversation just declines or dies out anyway because one party  or all  don t know what to say ,0
 when dealing with people  let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic  we are dealing with creatures of emotion  creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity   dale carnegie in how to win friends and influence people    as he explains why criticism is futile and dangerous   edit   im talking about bitter criticism being futile   constructive criticism is necessary in the world  after all  constructive criticism is considered as learning rather than  criticism  i believe  ,0

why do people feel that rejecting people is empowering  i can get it if the person is toxic  like a family member  partner  or friend  but why do people go on social media and brag about rejecting good people in their lives  it s really sad to me  i see memes of people bragging about ghosting their friends whenever they try to contact them  i see people bragging about rejecting someone trying to get to know them to date  then if it s the holidays people brag about being petty to family members who have done nothing but love them  then when it s done to them it s a problem but they feel they can hurt others and its okay    well to me it s not okay   ,0

how strangers treat you is determined significantly by how good looking you are i know that this post will get a lot of downvotes anyways because of the title  no matter what i write here  so lets get to it   this is one of the most universal laws of social skills and life in general  that im surprised i havent seen anyone else make a post like this one on here  a persons first impression of you  before you even initiate conversation  is formed by what you look like  a good looking person will always be treated better  at least at first  than an  ugly  person  if you are reading this and have constantly been excluded from or given less priority in social interactions throughout your life  the reason is more likely than not due to your looks  at least in part  i wish that people really were only judged by their behavior  not their face  but unfortunately this is the cruel reality of nature    i felt it necessary to post this here because people on this subreddit seem to have no idea that looks are even a factor when having a conversation with someone  i dont want to go into any specific posts ive seen  but much of how someone else judges you has nothing to do with what you say   a youtube video of a man talking about how he was treated for being ugly  https   www youtube com watch v  n noejtrya t    s  of course  the man in the video linked above is exceptionally  ugly   i hate using this word because it does not consider a persons character   but how you are treated  especially in regards to how women treat men  exists on a wide spectrum   edit  wow this post blew up  it still astounds me that some people are unaware of this although it is so noticeable in real life    anyways  ive gotten a few comments now on the last sentence in the post  i realize this could sound sexist to some people  and a more accurate statement would have been  especially in regards to how women treat men and men treat women  basically  this is more noticeable in interaction between males and females    thanks for reading   ,0

i am usually always the person who reaches out to other people to see how they re doing  i stopped doing this for nearly a week to see if anyone would check in on me  no one did  you keep hearing all this  personal distance not social distance  rhetoric considering everything that has been happening with covid     whichever way you call it  quarantine has been really hard for me because i consider myself an extrovert in many ways  i just always feel better being around people    for the past few weeks since covid got really big in the u s   i ve checked in on my friends to see how they were holding up  if they needed anything  etc etc  anytime i would do this  the conversation felt one sided and would quickly fizzle out after i would check in  i d send memes  especially tiger king or healthcare corona ones because all of my friends and i work in inpatient psych and both are highly relevant   i don t have any friends outside of work either    i felt like i was always the one checking in so i decided to hold back to see if anyone would initiate first starting last sunday  i found out monday that my graduation for my graduate degree was cancelled  both of my clinicals were cancelled for the rest of the semester  and my birthday which is on the   th is cancelled because groupon auto refunded my boyfriend s hotel and dinner reservations  needless to say  i ve been super down  i didn t announce any of these things to anyone except my boyfriend and our parents  no one ended up contacting me this week  i started thinking back more even before covid happened and i felt like i am always the one initiating conversations  i m usually the one who offers to help or buys friends a coffee or lunch but i rarely feel like it is reciprocated   all of my friends are my age yet also married with kids or expecting kids  i am in a long term relationship and don t have any kids besides a cat and a dog  i tried talking to my boyfriend about feeling isolated and he said that  they have their own things going on  and  they re just at a different stage of life than you are   i feel like he s getting frustrated because i m bummed out about everything and there s no end in sight and nothing he can really do to help  i just feel like my friends consider me a friend out of convenience  i don t feel like they care yet i don t have anyone else i can really connect with outside of work    don t know what to do or how to make things easier but i d appreciate any suggestions  i just feel like i m struggling to stay afloat    oh and fuck covid  ,0
i introduced myself to a guy ive been crushing on from a distance  and gave him my number im a pretty shy person  and i have trouble talking to people  today  after a lab i saw a guy from one of my lectures studying in the lab building  i thought he was really cute but never really had the courage to talk to him  i had a bunch of adreline rushing after finishing the lab  handed  a big assignment at  the end of the class and had a big weight off my chest  and i decided to try and talk to him  i didnt look very good   was very tired  no makeup and super baggy clothes  so normally i wouldnt even have enough confidence maintain eye contact   i kinda just said fuck it and went over and introduced myself to him  he was really nice  and we had a great conversation for like    minutes  at the end he said hed see me in class  but i asked  pretty quickly  if he wanted my number  ive never done that before but i guess i still was on an adrenaline rush  i was so nervous putting it in that i spelt my name wrong  and then i started typing my email down as well lol  im still cringing   but im so proud of myself for putting myself out there and i want to say that for anyone else who is crushing on a stranger in their class  that you can do it too     x   b   update  he just texted me and asked if i wanted to get coffee tomorrow   im internally screaming as to not wake up my roomates     x   b   update    thank you everyone for the kind comments and words of encouragement  thanks as well for the gold  not sure if it was a date  but we hung out and had some great conversations   sometimes i trailed off  didnt know what to say  but im probably overanalyzing it   he seemed really  interested in what i was saying  and he actually wanted to hang out longer  ,0
does anyone else find texting people insanely stressful  ive been texting girls recently  and ive come to the conclusion that texting is super stressful for me and puts a lot of pressure  normally  i can keep a conversation going over text  but i often get to points where i just go  what the hell do i say now   and i get stressed for not responding quick enough  i also make an effort to not leave my phone on the messaging app when i turn it off  because it happens when i turn my phone on  i immediately leave them on read and have to think of a response on the spot  then  after a while  i spend too much time thinking of responses and i unintentionally drag it out because of that  i often get into the situation where i send a response not knowing they are sleeping and then i get left on read the next day without any response  leaving me puzzled as to what to do next   i know in person is way to go  but with the situations ive been having  messaging in text is only the preparation to meet in person and have a great time together  i usually warm up to the person  have a few good conversations and ask if they want to hang out  am i the only one with this stress  ,0

an amazing piece of advice from a commenter on youtube  i didnt write this  i simply found it while watching vsauce and his  science of awkwardness  video  im definitely going to take it to heart  and so should you     as an older person who wasted a lot of time in this life being painfully awkward   im here to tell you this man is right  the older you get  the easier it becomes   but maybe you can get there a lot sooner if i share my older person secret  quick  tell me all about your great great grandmother   where was she born   where did she live   what were her struggles   how was her life   what did she dream of   who did she love    where is she buried     odds are huge that you do not know any of this  probably not even her name     next  have you ever been in a random cemetary   if not  do it soon   and when youre there  realize that there are millions of graves  all over the world  and pretty much no one alive visits them or even knows a thing about any of the people buried there longer than a couple generations   now picture its a hundred years from now and you are buried there   who cares   point is  life is soooo short  so realize that in the end  youre here and then youre gone   you will not have even existed a couple short generations down the road    the more you can get comfortable with this fact  the more youre set free to live every day comfortable in your own skin  doing what you want to do  thinking what you want to think  being the quirky person that you are  and loving yourself and your life   and the more you will see what a monumental waste of your precious time it is to give it up to worrying about how other people see you   because truly  in the end  no one cares but you  and you should care  a lot  because you are all you will ever have for sure   youngsters who struggle  understand that most of your messed up feelings are because the the world is a messed up place  not you   just be you   i have never met a person who didnt turn out to be fascinating and unique and amazing in some way  once i got to really know them   being different from each other is what makes the whole thing interesting   just be you   ,0
how to build self esteem  the ultimate step by step guide  it might be useful  edit  i was thinking about posting a similar article about confidence  are you interested   self esteem is arguably the most discussed topic in the self improvement community  and for a good reason     its the foundation for personal development     if youve been wanting to learn how to build self esteem  youve come to the right place  unlike other resources where youll find  quick tips  or  hacks to boost self esteem   im going to give you a full in depth guide that contains everything you need to know   the best part   this comes from my personal experience    what are we waiting for  lets do this        chapter     what is self esteem     if you want to build self esteem  you first have to know exactly what self esteem is       were also going to address a few misunderstandings about this topic in this chapter   first  lets define  self esteem  https   en wikipedia org wiki self esteem    according to google  its    confidence in ones own worth or abilities  self respect      heres another definition from the cambridge dictionary     belief and confidence in your own ability and value      i think you get the idea  basically  self esteem means you value yourself as a person    i want you to know a few things before we start         self esteem can be improved  a lot of people seem to think that self esteem is a game of luck  either you have it or you dont  and thats totally false   self esteem is something that can be changed and improved over time         self esteem doesnt come from external circumstances        being arrogant doesnt mean you have high self esteem  same thing with  confidence  https   www theintellect net posts how to be confident   i dont really know why but some people seem to mistake arrogance for confidence or high self esteem    an arrogant person can actually have really low self esteem but hes just trying to make up for it by acting like hes better than everyone else   valuing yourself as a person doesnt include putting others down or trying to impress other people  actually  its the other way around         chapter    how low self esteem can destroy your life    in this chapter  were going to talk about the consequences of low self esteem          lets dive into it             low self esteem is like driving through life with your handbrake on       maxwell maltz   like i said earlier  self esteem is the foundation for personal development  without it  youll face a lot of unnecessary difficulties in life    i could go on and on about how self esteem is important and all that  but i know that nothing beats real life examples so im going to throw a bunch of them here   sounds good  here they are         your career will suffer  lets say theres a really great promotion on the table  and that you want to be considered as a candidate   well  guess what  its very likely that youll never say anything about it  and that someone will get it instead  even if youre much better at your job  youll never get promoted   why   because you wont dare to step outside of your comfort zone and ask for that promotion  youll be too scared to voice your opinion or ask for anything  so youll prefer to retreat and just let it pass you by   this is just a small example but it illustrates my point         people will treat you badly  some people wont miss the chance to bully you if they sense that youre not grounded  be it in school  work or anywhere else  youll be treated like a doormat   people will ask you for unconvenient favors  delegate their work or homework to you  use you in many ways and even make fun of you   the worst part is that youll allow this type of behaviour because   you think you dont deserve any better           youll be miserable  honestly  your life will be quite bad  i mean how can you be happy when many people treat you like shit  when you dont even believe youre worthy of respect  and when you constantly feel like a victim of life    my guess is its quite difficult to be happy under these conditions         youll miss out on so many opportunities  because opportunities will require you to get out of your comfort zone  which is going to be difficult if you have low self esteem   the main reason is that you dont even think you can handle them well  so you prefer not doing anything at all   in essence  you prefer not to play the game at all than to play and potentially lose   do you see how this is totally counter productive  if youre asking why  the reason is simple    you will fail many times in life     so if you apply this method of thinking  youll always let great opportunities pass you by without lifting a finger          youll never live up to your full potential  look  no matter how fast a car can go  it will never move if the handbrake is always on   same thing here  the ultimate result is that youll basically   waste your entire life   if you dont do something about this         chapter    signs of low self esteem    if youre not quite sure whether or not you have low self esteem  here are the signs           you need validation from others  when people compliment or encourage you  you just feel great  its like youre on top of the world  you feel like you matter   on the other hand  if someone throws a negative comment or starts criticizing you  you instantly feel like youre worthless  the moment someone says something bad about you  you feel hurt  you feel vulnerable  and it always seems like the person whos saying the bad stuff about you is right   the bottom line is    you need recognition from others to feel good about yourself           you feel inferior to other people  everyone seems to be doing better than you for some reason  you always feel that everyones better than you  they seem to be way more confident  more successful and overall happier in their lives   you also feel like youre not important enough to voice your opinion so when youre talking with friends or people you know  you refrain from saying what you think because you assume that your opinion is less valuable         you always put other people before yourself  you re waiting in a line but someone takes your place   no problem  you have plans for the weekend but your friend always calls you for hep   ok  why not  you have a test tomorrow but you re helping someone else instead of studying   yeah  that s totally fine right    these are just some examples that take place in real life  putting people s needs before your own means that   you re willing to help other people even if you have important things to do just so they don t think negatively of you     you do this because you dont want to be seen as a bad person  so you gladly say yes to everyone   because youre afraid to say no     just to be clear  im not saying you should always put yourself first  some situations will require you to skip a class and help someone in desperate need for help for example  however  overdoing it makes you an easy target for people to take advantage of you         you beat yourself up for small mistakes   let s say you went to buy a bottle of soda  so you get into the store  pick up that bottle and then head to the cashier  you slowly walk up to him  but the moment you hand him the bottle  it slips out of your hand   you bend over to pick it up  you become red faced and embarrassed  you re saying to yourself  i m such an idiot  i can t even do this without screwing up     after that  you re too shy to even look at the cashier in the eyes because you re way too embarrassed  you quickly hand him the cash and get out of that store and wish you ll never come back   this simple example illustrates my point  every time you make a tiny mistake  you start thinking stuff like  im an idiot   im good for nothing   i always screw up    etc  basically  youre talking down to yourself   you always torture yourself for every single mistake you make and you see them as proof that youre worthless and not good at anything         you overthink what people say  when someone says something bad about you  youll spend ages thinking about it  even after the person who said it totally forgets about it         you think youre worthless  its self explainatory          you settle for less than you deserve   you settle for a mediocre quality of life even when you know you could change it   maybe your friends  your family  or your spouse is mistreating you  but you re not doing anything about it  maybe you hate your job  but you re scared of making the shift because you feel like that s all you deserve  maybe you have some kind of talent or skill  but you never bother to use that potential   here s what i want to say    you re settling for mediocrity just because you think you deserve it    you don t think you deserve to be happy and fulfilled  so you never even bother to look for a way to get there         you dont know how to take a compliment  this is the most subtle sign in the list  when someone gives you a compliment  do you feel like you dont deserve it  if you do  this applies to you   when you hold so many negative beliefs about yourself for so many years and someone gives you a compliment  it feels like youre an imposter  like you dont deserve it    you might even find yourself thinking   if that person really knew me  he would be disappointed  or something along those lines         chapter     why you have low self esteem    why do you have low self esteem in the first place  were going to try to answer that in this chapter           you dwell on the past   if i only could go back in time     i hate to break it to you  but its impossible  and i think you know that  constantly living in the past just because you think it was a better time for you wont make your life better  actually  the opposite is true    always looking back at  the good old days  will only make you feel a bitter feeling of nostalgia that will eventually turn into a feeling of helplessness  leading you to damage your self esteem as a result         you purposely underestimate yourself  if you always underestimate yourself  your abilities and your opinions  youll inevitably have low self esteem  no doubt about it   constantly running from adversity and thinking  no  i cant do that  isnt a good idea because over time    youll start to believe it     this will eventually lead to you not being able to do anything  and feeling helpless as a result  this will slowly decrease your self esteem as a consequence   this is both a cause and a consequence of low self esteem  doing this will lower your self esteem  and having low self esteem will make you do this         you overvalue what other people think  this is also one of the reasons why youre not confident  always taking what people say as the absolute truth will only hurt your self esteem in the long run   what other people say about you says more about them than it says about you    in most cases  this is very true  look  most people cant give you an objective opinion  most of them will tell you things based on their past experiences  their limiting beliefs  their fears  the way they were raised   etc   this is especially true when were talking about the negative stuff  anyone who intentionally puts others down is actually the one who doesnt feel good about himself   now  if you take this kind of toxic person and regard what theyre saying about you as the truth instead of seeing it for what it is  a desperate attempt to feel better about themselves  youll invitably feel bad   not to mention tha youll encounter many people like this in your life         you always talk negatively to yourself  you give too much importance to the little mistakes you sometimes make  i get it  sometimes you just feel like a loser and ive been there   however  talking down to yourself wont help you at all  doing this on a regular basis will affect your self esteem and cause you to feel like youre worthless   basically  doing this will make turn you into your worst enemy  life is hard enough  and you dont need to add unnecessary difficulties and mental torture to the mix         youve had bad childhood experiences  a bad experience as a child can potentially ruin your life if you dont handle it carefully   maybe people made fun of you  maybe you were really shy  maybe you were bullied  maybe you were rejected  maybe something more serious happened to you when you were younger   sometimes it takes only one bad experience to totally change your life for the worst   the reason why childhood experiences are particularly impactful is because youre easily influenced when youre a child  at the same time  most people find it hard to change when they grow up so whatever the consequences mightve been from your childhood  theyll stick with you even as you grow older         chapter    how to build self esteem    now were getting to the fun part  how to build self esteem       im going to give you some pratcical steps you can follow to build your self esteem  here we go first  check out      this video    https   www youtube com watch v felpvgavtu      itll give you a better idea about self esteem and how you can improve it           become good at something  this also works for building self confidence  if you want to build your self esteem and start feeling better about yourself  you need to develop a skill that youre good at   it could be anything you want  having a skill youre good at will improve your self esteem because youll feel competent and skillful  youll have something you can be proud of   in a way  youre proving to yourself that you can learn  that you can progress and improve  that youre someone who can offer valuable skills   over time  youll start seeing yourself differently  your self limiting beliefs will slowly fade away and youll gradually improve your self esteem      to do  become good at something          fully acknowledge your past mistakes  but how do you  acknowledge your mistakes   right   dont worry  this isnt some abstract advice you usually come across  ill explain how you can do this   look  we as human being will inevitably make mistakes  and some of them will result in regret  shame or any other negative feeling that can last for years   unfortunately  we tend to react emotionally to this kind of situation  this leads us to stay in the same vicious cycle of toxic feelings for years  without ever doing anything about it   so  what should you do     instead of feeling bad about your mistakes  you should learn the lessons from them and move on     how   grab a piece of paper and write down all of the worst mistakes you did in the past that still haunt you today  beside each one  write down the lesson you got from it   for example  i let a lot of people take advantage of me in the past  i was a doormat  the lesson from that is that in most cases  i must put my own comfort before anyone elses needs    notice that i said in most cases  some cases are exceptions      to sum up  make a list of your past mistakes  and beside each mistake write the lesson that you got from it  look at it very well  learn the lessons so that you won t do it again  and then throw that paper for good   now you got the lessons  no need to feel bad again  you did your job     to do   make a list of your past mistakes and the lessons you learned from each one of them           use your mistakes to guide you  this is a mindset shift that you have to implement in your life  when you make a mistake  dont start thinking stuff like  im an idiot   im wothless  or  im useless    heres how you can use your mistakes to your advantage  from now on  when you make a mistake  think about it this way  ok  i made a mistake  what can i learn from that and how can i improve    for example  you hate your job  instead of complaining or playing the victim  a more productive way of thinking could be  ok  so i hate my job  what can i do    the answer could be investing in books  courses and learning profitable skills that will help you earn a side income that youll eventually turn into a full time job   do you see the difference   the old method says  you suck  but the second method says  how can you become a better person        to do  ask yourself  how can i improve   instead of beating yourself up           put your own needs first  you should  in most cases  put yourself first  put your needs first  your goals first   chances are if you have low self esteem  youre putting everyone else first  and thats a problem  you have to learn to say no when you dont want to do something  whatever that other person might think of you   like other people  youre a human too  this means that you have feelings  goals  opinions  and plans for your life  and like anyone else  your life matters so why should you compromise your life for other people who are unlikely to do the same   keep in mind that some cases are exceptional but for the most part  this is very true     to do  say no when you dont want to do something           ditch the people who mistreat you  maybe you have some  friends  who always disrespect you  maybe its someone in your family  whatever it might be  you have to stop associating yourself with people who dont value you as a person    i know it may sound difficult  but staying with those people will prevent you from building your self esteem because doing so will mean   youre accepting to be treated that way     now you might be asking   should i just stay alone   and to that ill answer  find new friends   how   here are some things you could try     join a club  it could be a sports club  an art club   etc   whatever  just join a club where youll likely find people who have the same interests    contact old acquaintances  maybe theres someone who was in your class  or maybe someone you worked with  find some of your old contacts and see if you can befriend them   if you dont have any problem with your social circle however  then just skip this step     to do  find new friends          wear clothes that fit  as weird as it may sound  wearing clothes that fit you well makes you feel really good      to do  wear clothes that fit        final note   if you read this far  congratulations  this means that youre really committed to doing this

i notice when you expect nothing from girls you will start to see them as human beings  today was my first day at high school  i decide instead of chasing girls and expecting sex or something from them  i completely turn off my expectation for girls and it work well  i start seeing them as human beings rather than sex object  i was no longer creepy to girls and i wasnt as awkward around them as i was the past   years  today i also  directly  ask out my crush  she didnt give a clear response so i drop it and move on with my life  i also cut out the girls i was in the friend zone with  after all woman shit like man  woman have interest and goals like us  woman are imperfect like us  it took me months to realize this and i just want to thank r socialskills for the tips  to the people that needs tips about girls  honestly just focus on yourself while caring what on people minds  idgaf mentally is overrated tbh  and if you see a girl you like just be direct with her  if not just move on with life this will also protect you from being friendzoned  b y   s o m e o n e   w h o   i s   k e e p i n g   y o u   a r o u n d   a s   a n   e g o   b o o s t   look  but dont stare  give yourself a count to   to notice her body and then that is it  eye contact  forehead contact  look at her ears  or just over her shoulder  once that   count is over your eyes must be up and on her face or off in the distance   partake in an activity that has women who also partake in that activity  talk to them  all of them  see who you become friends with  that will go a long way to helping you interact with them as peers instead of treating them like a machine with a sequence of buttons that will lead to romance   edit  for those that asking question like  how tf didnt you see woman as human beings  i was watching porn from  th grade and it warped my view on woman  i quit porn but kept coming back to it before putting it to a end in june  moral of the story  dont watch porn   edit    thank for the three sliver kind stranger  edit    after reading some comment i figure it would be pretty dickish to drop girls who actually want to be friends  just talk to them just as any other male without putting them at a pedestal   edit    holy shit gold  thank for the gold kind stranger  edit    you guys are insane  thank for the platinum   edit    i just glad that i help people  ,0
be careful with projection   what you assume of others is really coming from within yourself  challenge your assumptions and see how often you re wrong  are you very judgmental of others   this will lead you to believe they re being judgemental towards you    do you think you re a loser  it doesn t mean everyone else does  but you will likely assume this   do you think you re not worthy of anyone s attention    you will assume others think this as well    this will result in your speaking low  unconfident and therefore making yourself seem unworthy   you don t live in people s heads and therefore  remember that  if you try to assume what they think  the only source of information you have is from within yourself   of course there are cases where people blatantly give cues that lead to these assumptions  but if you find yourself repeatedly coming to a conclusion about  people   look within yourself    if you want to be comfortable in social situation  you have to be realistic and give people a chance to show you who they are   stop assuming people s thoughts   you are     of the time wrong   those are your thoughts   have you ever heard the saying  you can t love others if you don t love yourself first     what this means is   if you hate yourself  you project hate onto others   you assume they hate you too  therefore  your capacity to open yourself and interact with them is limited  and as an effect  they won t show you love either   this is projection   if you love yourself   you will see that love in others  you will assume that they welcome you  and that behavior will lead them to love you back    it s just a positive form of projection at the end of the day   thats what the quote really means and it is      true  ,0
i just got a girl friend    i never wouldve thought i would get a girlfriend  but now i have  and i actualy like her  this is the best day of my life   edit  holy hell     k karma  how the f    k    ,0
i decided to be myself      for a whole day  and these are the results    having social anxiety coupled with being a people pleaser makes being yourself very  very difficult  but i said to myself   i can decide to be fake for the rest of my life  but first i wanna see what its like to be myself for at least a day    firstly  work was amazing  naturally  im a bit goofy and easy going  but due to wanting to be a people pleaser i become dull and boring  essentially  i tone down my personality because i worry ill annoy everyone around me    i started to tell the awful jokes that i laugh at and that i know are bad but make me happy  i did get laughs from co workers and costumers and it felt much better because it was      part of me and what i like  if someone told a joke  that i didnt find funny i wouldnt laugh just to get them to like me  or if someone said something i didnt agree with  i didnt agree with them just to  keep the peace  i told my opinion regardless of the consequences    when i saw this woman with beautiful eyes i actually went up to her and told her she had amazing eyes  i normally love giving complements but sa never let me speak up    later that day  i went for a walk and a guy strikes up a conversation with me  from the first words that fell out of my mouth i made a promise in my head to be transparent and honest with this stranger regardless of if theyll accept me for who i am    we end up talking for around   hours  and the conversations got deep  i told him about a lot of stuff in my life that id normally hide out of fear of being judged   mainly my hobbies and the fact that im a virgin etc   those honest moments made our conversation more real and our connection seemed genuine because he actually knows me  a big one for me  which admittedly is kinda silly  is whenever i meet a christian  i was raised a christian  but i kinda drifted away from religion a bit  but i still believe in god and i know about the bible  however  in the past when id meet a christian i would just say i was a christan    from then on  id have to basically wear a mask concealing who i really was and it was exhausting pretending to be a perfect christan when in reality im not that at all    the guy himself was a christan and as badly as i wanted to be accepted i also wanted to be myself  so i told him the truth and everything worked out just fine   it made me realize it doesnt matter if he accepts me  but i should be me regardless of what he thinks     theres a few more examples but i dont want to have you guys reading a whole book so ill end it here  i  hope this silly little post helps someone try this to  it was a fun experiment and im trying my best from here on out to be me     edit    gold   and silver   youre too kind thank you     platinum    you guys are insane   i love you all  i hope this post has changed some lives for the better  ,0
i made the mistake so you don t have to i ve shared this story with a few close friends  and it s relieving to get it off my chest  i have a lot of socially awkward friends  and i m the opposite  i m outgoing  charismatic  etc  etc  but i m not here to brag  i m here to explain how i became this way  or more so  the event that changed my whole outlook on life  for most of my years  i was very antisocial  shy  nervous  i had no social skills  any jokes i tried were seen as  unfunny   i had no real friends  i had been abused physically and verbally as a small child  throughout all of elementary  by a drug addicted family member  so it left mental scars which honestly still haven t fully healed  i had to  grow up  fast  in comparison to the rest of my grade  i always felt isolated  did well in school  never caused problems  but just didn t fit in    one day  i had decided that enough was enough  i had been in a depressed state for months on end  crying myself to sleep  the loneliness had settled in and created a void  my social awkwardness was ruining my life   what kind of world wants a fuck up like me  nobody likes me   that was the only thought that went through my mind  i decided to end it all  i grabbed a skip rope  tied it up in my closet  and hung myself  i m not sure how long i was hung up  but i faded out of consciousness  i woke up on the floor of my closet not long after  the rope had snapped under my weight  i was overweight at the time  which was another reason for my low confidence  but  as i sat there  i realized i had almost just died  been gone  a nobody  i wouldn t have been remembered for long by anyone outside of my family  i would ve just been known as  that weird kid who killed himself  by my peers  i sat there and really introspected on my life  i wanted to know what truly caused my loneliness  then  i had an epiphany  it was me    it was always me  i was the shy one  i was the one not picking up on social cues  i was the one who didn t fit it  not because of some predetermined factor  but because of how i acted and presented myself  the reason for my poor social skills was completely due to the fear of trying to improve  so  that night  as i sat in my closet  a red mark bright around my neck  i decided to change  i decided that if life isn t worth living  i would make it worth living  although the mindset change was  overnight   so to speak  the results weren t  it took time  first  i was more outwardly positive  smiled more  complained less  i started talking to people i wouldn t normally talk to  popular people  older people  etc  i d strike up a conversation with anyone around  it wasn t easy  my heart raced every conversation  i felt like i d pass out  but you know what to me  was even harder than breaking out of my shell  dying and it hardly impacting anyone  i wanted to matter   before i knew it  without even noticing until far into it  i was making friends  real friends  not just people who d hang out with at school or work and never talk outside of that  i made friends who genuinely cared about me  people who d notice if i was less cheery than usual  people who would be devastated if anything happened to me  within a year  i went from nobody knowing i existed  to being the guy that almost everyone knows  i learned how to talk to different people  small little tips and tricks for every situation  based on repeated trail  error  trail  error  trail  error  until success  yes  there were difficult times  sharing my emotions with people is still hard  i cried openly to my friends for the first time last summer  sat down on a hill after work and just cried  and cried  before  i would ve died of embarrassment to cry in front of anyone  now  i feel safe  and secure  being able to show how i m feeling to people who care about me     if i can give you any advice  that i know you d listen to  i d tell you to try to be social  get out of your comfort zone  the funny thing about comfort zones is they grow the more you test their boundaries  don t let the failures set you back at all  the more time socializing with people  the better  don t let the loneliness take hold  don t make what changes your life be something you ll regret for the rest of it  like me  don t try to hurt yourself  life is about bettering yourself  and if you re in this subreddit  congrats  you re already on your way to improving  you re showing the will to change   anyone can make friends  anyone can find people to surround themselves with that truly care  life does get better  but only once you start taking those first steps  it gets easier  today  i have almost no social awkwardness  except perhaps telling a joke a little too dark here and there   part of my job is now being in charge of guest experience personally  and i m in a position of authority at work  i would have never dreamed of having the courage to ever work a job like this years ago  if i can do it  anyone can  i m not special by any means  just  do me a favour  and try  it s the world that s missing out on you  not the other way around  remember that  i know you ll make the world a better place  just by contributing your thoughts and ideas to whoever you d like  instead of nobody  i believe in you  and i always will   j  tl dr  i was shy  anxious  and lonely  tried suicide  failed and decided to change my life  if i could turn that around  so can you  i believe it  ,0
has it occurred to anyone else that the people with actually good social skills probably aren t on reddit or a subreddit dedicated to social skills  and thus  most of the advice from ppl posting here probably isn t that credible   ,0
a message to the under    crowd on this sub there are a ton of posts on this sub from people in high school  and i just want you all to know some things    first off  its okay to not know who you are yet  its okay to still be scared to talk to the opposite gender  thats all very normal  you absolutely should not be worried about  reinventing  yourself  youre still learning who you are  and so are all of your peers    i suggest this  find something you really enjoy  that improves you  something you can do every day  that you will never get sick of  if you read every single day  you will become very literate  and probably much more articulate  articulate people tend to naturally attract other people  if you work out every day  you will get in excellent shape  reap a bunch of positive brain function benefits  and obviously people will be attracted to you because youre in shape  find something productive to master  if youre a master of any craft that results in self improvement  you will absolutely attract other people  and find yourself surrounded by like minded individuals     stop worrying about petty things that dont have any significant value  social media presence  expensive clothes  voice tone  skin color  he said she said gossip  all of that stuff is just noise      last  be honest  and do it  tactfully       of the questions in this sub are resolved by honesty  either with yourself  or your family  or your peers  tell people what you actually think  in a way that is  productive   go after the things and experiences you actually want  in a way that is productive  if you need to tear down others or step on other people to get what you want  youre doing it wrong  ,0
i forget like     of my vocabulary and sentence structure when i m speaking to someone new this is so frustrating  i m an intelligent person and when i m writing  talking to people i know well or talking about something i m confident in  like in a presentation  i m very fluent and have a wide range of vocabulary    when i m talking with people that i don t know that well  especially during small talk  it s like i forget basic words  i say things that don t make sense or forget the name of very simple objects or get my sentences muddled up    it makes me feel really stupid and makes me so embarrassed for ages afterwards replaying what i have said wrong  half the time  i end up avoiding that person afterwards or being even worse when i next speak to them because i m so embarrassed  for example  i m at a point with my boss where i can t even say  hi  how are you doing   without getting confused because i got into a vicious cycle of feeling nervous  messing up and then messing up more out of increased nerves   just wanted to get that off my chest in a safe space  does anyone else find this  any tips  ,0
i suck at small talk and used to think i had to master it to make friends as an adult  but this is wrong  small talk is by definition bad conversation  heres a far better way to start conversations and make more friends    about this post    i m just a regular guy who enjoys writing about making friends in adulthood  i m      in      i found myself with one friend i d call  close   and since then  much of my spare time has been dedicated to fixing this   this post  and all others  is nothing more than a fun project where i write about things i ve found  i am not   nor in any way   claim to be an expert on making friends or any crap like that        today s post is about small talk   i used to find myself stuck in small talk all the time  and was genuinely crap at it  seeing as my goal was to make new friends  i figured i had to get better at it    right    wrong   theres no such thing as better small talk  small talk by definition is terrible conversation  and as youll see  theres a much better way   this post was first written on my blog where i added pics i cant include here  reddit doesnt let me    to read the post in its original glory  with pics  click  here  https   makeclosefriends com the secret to fun conversation     otherwise enjoy        the secret to fun conversation  have you ever found yourself stuck in crappy small talk   everyone has  it s boring  goes nowhere  and leaves a feeling of awkwardness with whoever spoke with   the reason this happens is because most people approach meeting new people in the wrong way  it s too rigid and formal   you solve this by changing your mindset when meeting strangers  from here on i want you to        assume everyone is already your good friend       let me explain   here s how a normal conversation begins        you    hi  good to meet you  how are you       bob    i m good thanks  what about yourself     you    i m great too  so i heard you re an architect     bob    yeah for   years now  i work in        congrats  you ve now entered small talk land  the home of the bored and depressed  instead here s how a better conversation goes        you    hey what s up man  how things     bob    i m good thanks  what about yourself     you    ahh man  i m bored as hell  i got stuck in a conversation with my wife s uncle  clown lectured me for    minutes about selling propane  what about you   anyone bored you yet     bob    actually  see that woman by the statue  i had a chat with her about her daughter s graduation  she wouldn t stop      see the difference   by treating bob like a friend and speaking accordingly you give him a chance to do the same   which opens the door to a potential friendship   of course  the other person isn t always going to respond with something good  some people take time to warm up   and others are just born boring   but the point is you lose nothing by speaking to them with the same ease you would with a good friend   i remember when i first tried this  i was worried i would look like some socially inept odd ball  but to my surprise tons of genuine  fun guys have loved the humour and openness   it was a relief  but made sense right away    after all  wouldn t you love it if someone spoke with you like this    seriously give it a go   i bet you ll be pleasantly surprised by the results           about me   my name is jay and i ve been trying to make friends as an adult since      with moderate success   i love writing and i write posts like these for the sheer fun of it  hopefully you like it   let me know if you did   this is the  st post i ve ever shared  if you like my stuff you can read more about my friend making journey on my personal blog  here  https   makeclosefriends com blog    ,0
if you want to get better  give up  stop trying for a perfect outcome  just start allowing life to happen  i spent quite a lot of my childhood and young adulthood with paralyzing social anxiety  i was perpetually worried about things going wrong  people not liking me  anything social gave me anxiety to the point of misery  but of course as anyone in that situation knows  i was also miserably lonely and really wanted a social life and friends  of course  everything just tore me up  because life occurs in a social setting   and without social interactions your life is pretty limited in scope a lot of the time  again  all of the problems that are first hand obvious to anyone going through social anxiety   fast forward in time  everything did go wrong  i missed out on dating  i missed out on friends  i missed out on work opportunities  the reality is that my life was hellish in a lot of ways    but the part that i didnt get at the time was that it was my fear of being hurt  my fear of rejection  my fear of pain that was actually precipitating all of these outcomes  the specifics dont matter as much as the general trend  by attempting to avoid pain   i always ended up with more pain further down the road  more difficulty talking to women  more difficulty talking in groups  more difficulty in life in general       what i am trying to communicate is this   dont place so much weight on the outcomes of social interactions  you are going to fail  what i didnt understand  or want to accept is that everyone has social interactions that fail  your dream girl will shoot you down  you will have an embarrassing statement in front of a crowd  on and on  you are going to mess up  but attempting to avoid that pain is not going to make the situation better  it will make it worse    if you want to get better  give up trying to create a specific outcome  embrace the pain that you are actually feeling right now  and accept that it is true  dont attempt to run from it  or cover it up  understand that the pain is telling you to give up trying to control everything   not telling you to try to control the outcomes even more tightly  ,0
when messaging texting someone  read over your message and make sure there is actually something for the person to reply to  i  and a lot of people i know  have a habit of writing every message like its the last  then get anxious when the conversation dies  if you know you do this  remember to end every message with a question  or at least write things that lead to questions    this means  no self deprication  theres not a lot of ways to respond to someone being self depricating unless youre a master of the craft  making a blunt statement like life sucks leaves the responder with very little wiggle room  because not everyone wants to talk about how shit their lives are  all the time   try to back it up with something  or change the topic immediately   and no responses such as yeah or lol  if you reply with just that you need to expect to be getting no response in return   if you ever feel yourself getting offended at your friends not replying to you  look over what youve actually given them in terms of linguistic material   edit  woah my first silver  thank you kind stranger   edit   jesus h christ  gold   thank you generous donator  and all the commenters  im glad my ramblings have brought a lil something to your lives  be well friendos  ,0
be an  everybody  kind of person  i was chatting with one of my buddies today who i consider to be extremely social  charismatic  and well liked by everyone  he s someone with an extremely confident vibe and you would be able pick up on it the moment you met him    when him and i go out together  getting shopping done and running errands  for example   he s always shooting the shit with everybody  he makes small talk everywhere he goes and with anyone    in the car ride today  he explained to me that he s an  everybody  kind of person  meaning  he talks to everyone  older people  children  good looking women  unattractive women  foreigners  puppies    you name it    this  everybody  mentality has enabled him to make friends with all types of people from all kinds of backgrounds    it s easy to get stuck in the cycle of   oh  id never get along with that person  he she is too old different young etc    and when this happens we shut ourselves off from      gaining social momentum because we become too  choosy      making new connections     embracing serendipity     you never know how or when you re going to meet your best new connection     for example  i m well acquainted with an older woman who s in my meditation classes  i d never usually talk to her  but something drew me towards her  the other day she introduced me to a young friend of hers  who i am now taking on a date  it s spontaneous interactions like this that make your life interesting     embrace spontaneity  be an  everybody  kind of person  be friendly and chatty with everyone  you never know where you will end up         cheers to developing our social skills and being able to talk to anybody      laz    ps  i have a weekly newsletter where i publish my insights on social and dating success  you can join that here  its free    https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine  https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine   ,0
im actually quiet because i need to think before i speak or else i say the stupidest things i wonder if anyone else is like this  like honestly my anxiety isnt even that bad  but whenever i dont think before i speak  i misunderstand what people mean  what my reply will sound like  and just say the stupidest things possible  thats why i need to think about what i say for a few seconds before i actually say it  but that means i miss topics a lot in conversations and appears cold shy  ,0
i actually answered a question in class today i feel dumb for feeling so proud about just this simple thing  but i havent actually raised my hand in class probably all of high school because of social anxiety  the teacher looked pretty shocked when i raised my hand haha cause i never do and am suuper shy and my voice was shaky but i think this is a good start  i rarely feel proud of myself but now i truly am  my hand shaked afterwards but hey  i did it  ,0
if you need confidence  compliment a stranger  if you need a positive interaction that doesnt last long  find something nice to say to them  its always a quick exchange  and can be extended as long as you want most of the time  not only does it feel good to brighten their day  it also helps build confidence for longer chats with people   i find it helps when my anxiety makes me afraid of people   edit  this blew up and theres a lot of self depreciation here     you can be ugly and still have positive interactions with strangers  also you probably arent as ugly as you think     if they treat you poorly  or react in a way you dont expect  or even made you uncomfortable pleasepleaseplease know that you still left your comfort zone  and said actual words to a stranger  that is scary and it is huge and you are brave  stick with it  not everyone is receptive to compliments but you will make someones whole week at some point     you can compliment people outside your  prospective partner  groups because being nice doesnt have to be precursor to a proposition  ,0
protip  stop  keeping score  in your relationships ive seen people talk a lot on this sub about  realizing  that so and so doesnt care about them   isnt a true friend   etc  because that person never reaches out to the poster  and then a bunch of people hop on the comments and start validating them    stop     speaking from experience  m  mid   s   this is not a healthy way to think about your relationships  i lost close lifelong friends from school because i thought like this  i lost once close roommates who thought like this  this kind of thinking breeds resentment and blows up your relationships   thats not to say you should put up with a total failure to reciprocate  there are good reasons to end friendships and cut some people off  but if you feel like something is unfair in your relationship with another person  you owe it to yourself and to them to directly and explicitly express how you feel  relationship counselors generally recommend stating in a non accusatory way how you feel  what the behavior is thats bothering you  and how its affecting you  you can find this everywhere  e g   i feel statements    a lot of the work that goes into maintaining connections and relationships is often invisible and goes unnoticed  sometimes the other person is similarly frustrated or is doing work that you may not be noticing either  most people dont intend to be insensitive or screw you over  often they just dont know how their behavior is affecting you  they wont know how you feel unless you tell them   tldr  if you value your relationships  suck it up and talk about your damn feelings    nicely and while being open to the possibility that the other person is also unsatisfied with something in your relationship  ,0
do you ever feel like you are too kind and nice to people but they never reciprocate the same level of energy  i m    f  at university  i just feel like people don t respect me enough  i m nice to everyone  as much as i can be   offer help whenever needed  never talk down to anyone or see people differently  human decency  but i just feel like they do not take me seriously enough to want to pursue a serious friendship with me or hang out with me  message first etc    i ve been in a serious relationship since high school  my boyfriend is the most stable person in my life as far as friendships go  he s super attractive  smart and loved by everyone but i see this exact problem happens to him as well  he s oblivious about it and doesn t seem to care about it as much as i do though  i want strong friendships that go beyond my relationship    people never ask me how my days been going  seem to think only their life matters   never think of asking me anything other than advice about themselves  i m so frustrated  im never messaged first unless they need something  or if they want to get info because i m on good terms with everyone  am i a pushover  how do i get out of this rut and get a more self confident attitude and make friends for life  maybe there s something wrong with us and the way we behave   edit  i just wanna extend this by saying i was wrong in thinking there s something  wrong  with people like me  there s absolutely nothing wrong in ever being a kind   good person  as long as you re putting yourself first  so i want to rephrase the last sentence of the post   update  wow i m shocked at how this blew up   for a lot of you who start their response with  you probably won t read this  yes i am indeed still reading all the responses with amazing advise  lessons  perspectives and support over the past    hours  i m very emotionally overwhelmed by how understanding everyone has been especially to each other  thank you     update     while a lot of people have been constructively saying that  it s not nice to be kind to someone just to get something in return  the same treatment  i completely understand and agree however i meant this post in a completely innocent way of failing to understanding why i genuinely do things out of kindness for friends and they never reciprocate even in simply messaging a  hi  wanna hang out     so just wanted to put it out there that i don t intentionally act kind and nice but i agree that it could be a subconscious need for codependency as i ve read  ,0
anybody here feel like you re every bodies acquaintance but nobodies friend  title says it all   due to my natural disposition of not liking a good portion of people and being too shy to really show my true colors or try and dig deep to see others i have become a somewhat easy person to talk to and vent at but nothing more   in high school i could sit at most tables and knew a good amount of people but always felt out of place in any group i tried to be in  i have never had meaningful conversations and have always been a drifter or a sideline character in any social setting i m in   anybody else feel this way  people know you but you don t have any meaningful relationships and people just see you as that guy they kind of know who is an alright person and maybe a little bit strange    have a good one  ,0
apologizing because you hate yourself is not the same as apologizing because you realize you ve hurt someone and you wish to make amends  people you love should be able to tell you when you have mistreated them and receive an apology from you without the conversation becoming about your feelings  also  just because you made a mistake doesn t mean it s the end of the world  most people who feel mistreated just want you to acknowledge what you did  they don t want you to hate yourself  everyone fucks up sometimes  act like it by learning to genuinely apologize  ,0
no ones going to know you if you dont show them  after struggling massively with confidence issues for years  i finally realised this    i cant expect people to come to me or immediately be interested in me if i dont show them who i am and what i have to offer the world  as soon as the reality of this finally hit me  followed by the efforts i made to get out of my comfort zone  i can finally say i have a few cool people in my life who i always felt were missing before    so for anyone going through social difficulties  realise your time is limited here  people want to see you  some will love you  some will like you  others wont care  but very few will actually  dislike  you  never give up on taking steps to get where you want to be  its also ok to be ok with who you are right now  i promise  youre probably not as bad as you think you are   take care and good luck  ,0
does anybody else listen to everybody else when theyre talking but feel like people dont return the courtesy  i listen to people unconditionally  im not really interested in most of what is said by others which i realise is selfish but at least i dont straight up say i dont care  and i carefully listen and react accordingly   if i know theyre trying to be funny  i laugh  if theyre sad  ill apologise for them having a bad day or whatever theyre upset about  if theyre angry about something  i agree that it would annoy me too or whatever  but lately its starting to bring me down because nobody ever has anything positive to say  and my emotions are very much connected to others emotions and feelings  when somebody around me is angry i feel really tense and frustrated like i need to get out of there  and if someone is sad i feel down too  its exhausting  conversation is exhausting  my psychiatrist believes i have adult adhd  inattentive type  which explains why when listening to someone recount a long story or the plot of a tv show  i feel like im going to explode  my mind wanders off and i have to snap myself back and listen out for pauses so i can nod my head or laugh just to show the other person i am listening  and then thats it   people never seem to do the same to me  i have confidence issues so when i try to bring up something i often quickly finish what im saying and trail off  people let me  its sad that i try so hard to listen to others but others dont do it for me  i wonder what to even talk about nowadays  im so different to my family  my friends  sometimes even my boyfriend  maybe im just paranoid  but anybody else feel this way  like people dont wanna talk to you unless its about what theyre interested in too  im trying to not let it get to me but sometimes i think about it and it makes me feel a bit lonely  ,0
i approached someone for the first time ever in my life   there is this guy i had a class with about a year ago and he seemed cool and sweet to me  i never approached him before because he didn t really look my way and he was always with a friend group which is extremely intimidating to me  this past weekend i went to a coffee shop with my friend and he was working there  i was thinking of different things i could say to him when his shift ended he went outside to get on his bike  after a little push from my friend i followed the guy outside and said hey and his name  turns out he knew my name too  i said i liked his style and asked if we could hang out some time  he said yeah and i have him my number  the whole time my heart on beating so hard and i was so nervous  i m still surprised i got my words out so well  that was the first time i ever approached someone and introduced myself  it was so scary but i m so proud i did it  hopefully this can maybe you someone the little push they need  i did it and i didn t die    d ,0
today  i awkwardly asked my crush out and she said yes holy mackerels  holy mother of french toast  i m still sweating  this girl was my high school crush  i ve known her for    years and i still can t believe i got the courage to ask her out   it was probably the worlds most awkward phone call ever but i did it  i asked her out and she laughed and happily said yes  she sounded genuinely happy and was giggling to her hearts content  oh lordy the stars have aligned  edit  flying fish sticks  thank you all for your amazing words of encouragement and support  i ll keep you all updated    edit    jiminy crickets  thank you kind stranger for the gold and the most heartwarming message ever  i hope the days ahead bring you happiness and comfort    update  hoooooo yeah  we got in touch again and it looks like we re spending the afternoon at the beach snorkeling  her favorite thing to do  and then going to the movies  still deciding on a day as she s a busy college student at the moment  i ll let you guys know   ,0
i just did the most social thing in years and im about to pass out so literally i just got back from lunch and im itching to type this  i said  fuck it  and asked to sit down with a person sitting by themselves  when i asked they said they were leaving soon but it was fine  i got their name and asked them about their thanksgiving break  and told them i hope i wasnt making them uncomfortable i just wanted to sit with someone new and they said i wasnt making them uncomfortable  they left a few minutes after that and i moved back to my first seat and im actually shaking and i can feel my face and chest burning   sorry i just needed to get this out i havent felt this actively anxious in a long time   edit  oh goodness this got a lot more attention that i ever expected  you guys are really supportive about this and its really cool to see all that  d just to be clear  this conversation was like five minutes and i think i made her a bit uneasy  but i havent voluntarily talked to someone out of the blue for as long as i can remember  so this is a big deal for me  hopefully i can do it again  ,0
i m actually feeling happier during the quarantine  i m feeling happier because it means i m no different to everyone else  i know no ones being really social and it means i m not missing out  i m not super social but i feel bad all the time feeling like i should be able to be the life of the party but it s not very me and i usually clam up in social situations so people think i m boring or weird  so i m enjoying being me despite worrying about the apocalypse outside  ,0
friendly reminder for       stop chasing people and stop giving more energy to someone than they give to you seriously  i learned this the hard way in       first off  if someone wants to be your friend  bf gf  etc  you won t have to guess it ll be obvious and effortless  chasing someone means they re running away from you    if you picture this in a physical context do you realize how bad that looks  essentially  you re so desperate that you re hunting down someone who doesn t even want to be there  and for what   so they can pretend to enjoy your company   instead you should let them go and move on to be around someone who genuinely likes you and wants to be around you   energy  something i learned a lot about in      as well  if you re going above and beyond for a friend  initiating hangouts and conversations  always texting first  etc  it s a huge red flag that  you care more about them than they care about you  now  this isn t a bad thing because little to no relationship friendship is        but if it s beginning to feel like you re not a priority in their life or that you hold little value to them i think it s time to step back and give them the same treatment  the reason being is because this will inevitably lead to pain once they drop you entirely and you realize that you were the only one who cared in the first place  learning self respect can be hard but worth it      anyways  happy new years and let s do better this time around the sun     ,0
i tried asking for a girl number and i failed but i learned something out of this today i was feeling good so i kind of wanted to talk to someone so i started a conversation with a girl i didnt know  im honestly one of those guys that dont do this kind of stuff  i try to be as easy going as i can be  and if they feel to bothered by me i try to distance myself from them as to not bother them  nonetheless i talked to this girl that was heading to the same location as me we talked a lot of things and by the end of the walking i asked for her number  i told her i was interested in talking to her but that if she had a boyfriend or she wasnt interested i wouldnt bother her  well she indeed had a boyfriend so i promptly told her that its cool and sorry for making things uncomfortable for her  she was okay with it and that was it  i got home and started thinking how much i thought it would go wrong but honestly the worst thing that could have happened was that she said no  and she did say no  nonetheless it wasnt the end of the world  i thats all i got to share ,0
my confidence goes downhill when there s someone more confident talkative in a room  like i m losing all my confidence  i get interrupted a lot and i can t even do anything about it  it s always like that with group talks where there s someone more confident or more talkative than me  i m the most confident person in the world when i m with someone i m comfortable with or when i m with introverts i love them cause i can unleash my true personality when i m with them   but it s quite the opposite with extroverts  i actually pretty much become an introvert when i m surrounded with extroverts   i don t know what can i do about it  it feels like i could never become friends with someone more confident because i just feel so uneasy  uncomfortable and anxious  how can i stop putting them above me  ,0
don t say  i m cool with anything  often times people will ask you something to the degree of  what do you want to do     what day is good for you     what do you think    i ve noticed people often think they are being accommodating by saying they are flexible  but that s not really what the other person wants to hear  they want input to make their decision easier and you re throwing it back on them and it s annoying    i remember i once came up with this list of like    things to do on a vacation with my sister so she can pick some she liked and she responded with  i m happy with whatever you want     she thought she was being helpful  but really she was dodging contribution and being indecisive  i don t want that i want the person to say something  i explained that to her after the fact and she was more helpful then  but i realized that a lot of people don t realize this unspoken rule  and put the other person in an awkward position of explicitly explaining they want input  anyway  don t do this    it also makes you look kind of spineless like you don t have the courage to state an opinion on anything  i have another friend who always says  i m down for whatever  when i give a few options  this is annoying  contribute  give an opinion  and if you really are down for anything at least brainstorm with the other person the pros and cons  i m down for anything but the beach will be crowded today   sorry if it came off as a rant  but i do think it will help some people on this sub   edit  a lot of people are bringing up that this is due to anxiety and insecurities and that this makes it okay  it s totally okay  all social struggle is  okay   if it overwhelms you to the point of panic of course it s okay to not state an opinion  unfortunately though  it still has social consequences  and most people you meet don t know about this internal struggle so it s still important to work on  this post is more to shed light on how there are social consequences  and now that you know you can work on changing that  ,0

i told my crush that i like him i told my crush of   months  but feels like a lot longer  that i like him   he started working where i work   months ago and immediately he caught my eye  we clicked right away and we acted like we knew each other our whole lives   we ended up becoming friends and hanging out with other coworkers or sometimes alone  then i realized that i really liked him  he s everything that i ve wanted    i decided that it was time to tell him how i felt and after work i told him i needed talk to him   it took me about   minutes to get the courage for the words to come out and we were just laughing because i couldn t get it out  then it finally came out like word vomit   he told me he didn t feel same way and that he s sorry if he lead me on to believe that he did  he was extremely nice about it and wasn t awkward everyone at work was super positive that he liked me and all encouraged me to tell him  i thought he did too  then he said that he didn t  it was pretty heartbreaking  it all happened within the last hour    anyway  i just feel like i needed to share my story  i m really proud of myself because i have never done this in my life  i think maybe now i can get over him because i have the closure  honestly i think if you have a crush you should go ahead and tell them how you feel because there s no reason to prolong it  it really really sucks if they don t feel the same way but hey it happens    if anyone has any questions about how to build up the courage to do something like this please ask me  because i m not some super confident person that can just do this  so if i can  you definitely can  ,0
my confidence goes up and down based on if other people seem to like me as i said my confidence fluctuates all the time  on some days when people arent that friendly towards me my confident plummets  and some days when people take initiative to talk to me i get very happy and feel  approved     for instance if someone who i really admire starts a conversation with me i gain confidence and become more social    i know people cant always take initiative every day because life is random and my confidence shouldnt rely on wether i met that person today and he or she talked with me  ,0

why does messaging feel so crushingly exhausting  is this normal  am i a sociopath  i panic when i see a message in my inbox and ignore it for as long as possible  but thats tiring too because i worry about what theyll think of me  its just that talking online exhausts me and i know that sounds spoiled and dramatic but i cant help how i feel  i get depleted by it and to me  if i finish work and then get into texting someone thats basically extra work  i dread all social interactions and i dont know why they affect me like this  but it feels like all i do is either do them and hate it or spend my time worrying about how much ill hate it  what can i do  ,0

does anyone else feel like they have a lot acquaintances but no close friends  i have felt like this for a long time   no one invites me anywhere  no one hardly talks to me other than my co workers and i only talk to them at work   no one messages me  or asks me to hangout   i feel like people just talk to me until someone better comes along   i have no deep connections with anyone   it seems like people like me but just as someone to occasionally chat with for a moment or two and then go hang out with their real friends   i think i am a good conversationalist and take an interest in listening to others   i have been told i am funny and good at socialising but no one seems to want to form a friendship   does anyone else have this problem  ,0
how to have better conversations    dont multitask  give the other person your sole attention     dont pontificate  if you just want to state your opinion without any comment or feedback  write a blog  remember its a conversation and not a monologue      use open ended questions  rather than asking   did that make you angry afraid happy etc  instead ask   how did that make you feel   or  what was that like      go with the flow  thoughts will come into your mind  and let them flow out of your mind  stay with the speaker  dont be too quick to change the subject     if you dont know  say you dont know      dont equate your experience with theirs  if someone tells you they just lost a family member  dont tell them you have as well  it is never the same  all experiences are individual  dont make it about you     try not to repeat yourself  its condescending and really boring     stay out of the weeds  people dont care about the details  the years  names of people they dont know  too much detail makes the story less interesting  people dont care about the details  they care about you     listen  the most important skill you can have  calvin coolidge said  no man ever listened his way out of a job   it takes energy and effort to pay attention and listen  stephen covey said  most of us dont listen with the intent to understand  most of us listen with the intent to reply       be brief   a good conversation is like a miniskirt  short enough to retain interest  but long enough to cover the subject    they all boil down to  be interested in other people  everyone knows something you dont   be prepared to be amazed  ,0
if youre hanging out with someone  please do not text talk with someone on your phone  im actually the example here    this actually happened twice today  i was with a friend shopping and i was making plans with a friend for later that day   i wasnt bored with my current friend or anything  but the friend i was texting i had made plans with prior and i wanted to finalize the plans   the friend i was with asked who i was texting and got a little insecure i could tell       later that day  the friend i was texting earlier and i were hanging out  once again  i was texting someone and just like the friend i was with earlier  she asked who i was talking too  she also sounded insecure for obvious reasons because clearly i am making them feel irrelevant   this is probably obvious  and ive always knew this was a bad habit  but i feel for it anyway  i felt absolutely horrible and guilty on the spot  just a heads up guys  put the fucking phone down and pay for attention to your friends   ,0

the human mind tends to focus on the negative  we can have one small embarrassing moment  and our mind will blow it out of proportion and keep replaying it  we need to make a conscious effort to think of something else  it is a challenge to redirect our thoughts  but it will give us peace of mind   ,0

without boundaries  you will always be a follower  without boundaries  others will always find ways to manipulate and abuse you  without boundaries  your wants needs will never be met by yourself  boundaries are the most important  even beyond confidence    years ago i was stuck in my head and had no sense of self  someone would guilt trip me for my login and i would cave  while in my head i would rationalize away my lack of backbone by saying that i was being strategic and avoiding conflict   if someone tried to anger me  i would still show anger but i would say nothing and walk away  i would always avoid conflict to my own detriment  people would be able to pressure me to question myself  one close friend even lead me down the path to question my whole world view and i even started to question my sexuality even though ive never been remotely attracted to dudes  i was so lost in my own mind and insecurities  that i had no basis for who i was and so i couldnt protect  me   they almost pressured me into having sex with them by rationalizing that you needed to try things out in order to develop a larger world view  thankfully i woke up before things got bad  that shit is manipulative af  so what  you need to kill someone to truly understand what killing people is like  clearly horseshit  no one can experience everything  you do what you want within reasonable ethical limits through your own value system   all of this culminated to a point where i literally put the pause button on my life and went insane  experiments with psychedelics  risky social behaviors  non stop self improvement and research etc  ive come to realize that confidence is not the most important thing to have in social environments  its still very important and useful  but its not the be all end all  boundaries are the most important  ive seen people with no outward confidence have strong boundaries  and having those boundaries is what lead others to respect them  confidence can somewhat help you develop boundaries  but you can be confident and unaware  and therefore not have boundaries  confidence does not equal self esteem   psychopaths narcissists sociopaths literally smell your lack of self esteem and inability to enforce boundaries  girls who do this will be abused  in fact  this is usually why you see some ugly dude with a shit personality  and no money status interests with a hot girl whos obsessed with him  she has no self esteem or boundaries and hes mercilessly capitalizing on it  people in general too  you will be a doormat for everyone  before caring about non verbals or any of that other  fake bravado confidence   learn to say no  figure out what you want need  if you dont want someone to touch you  say no  if you dont want to do something that will put you at risk say no  who cares how others react to that  someone who doesnt respect your boundaries doesnt respect you  take that in  ,0
   seconds of your time could change my social life forever  as far back as i can remember ive had bad teeth  at age    i had my   front top teeth pulled and a few on the bottom  obviously being that age the kids in school were pretty harsh and eventually i started wearing a jacket over my mouth everyday   i was basically a real life kenny from southpark  not funny but lol    ive had more teeth pulled since then and currently have   on top in the way back and   on the bottom  i really need help im    now and its hard to get a job because im so ashamed and embarrassed to talk to people  i feel like dealing with this for so long it gave me a mental illness or something idk   but anyway the part where you can help   i entered a contest where they are picking    winners      each of the next    months  to get a full smile makeover using dental implants  it takes a few seconds to vote just your name and email and your done  im way behind in the votes so every vote means alot  getting this done would be crazy   im an outgoing person on the inside but ive never been able to be myself  thanks for reading  link to vote   https   woobox com yp iaw gallery nabm  rryfi  https   woobox com yp iaw gallery nabm  rryfi    amp  x   b   edit  thank you guys so much ive been trying to thank you all  individually  its hard to keep up  i really cant thank you enough  ive been kinda lost for words     update  i ve been in the lead for   months now and   winners have been picked ahead of me  it sucks cause obviously i assumed if i had the most votes i d win   but i have over       more votes then the person in  nd and still haven t won  if y all can do me a huge favor and spread my voting link  above  or vote for me if you haven t i will be extremely grateful  i feel like the higher we get the votes the more likely the chances  everybody getting picked is old with kids  and a life  i m never going to have either if i don t get this procedure done  the last winner in the contest is picked around my birthday in april      and idk what i ll do if i lose honestly  i m literally writing this at      am because this is all i think about  i know people will say  there are people out there that have it worse  and that s      true  but nothing is worse than death and i m afraid that that s what my life is going to come to and it s a terrible feeling  i hated making this post to begin with  i didn t want anybody to watch that video of me talking but now i realize it s all or nothing  ,0

advice  never decline an invitation to hang out get drinks from anyone new you care about because they won t invite you again and you will regret it  m    what happened in my case was that i got along with   girls from my school  we were already friends a few years prior but never hung out together really  i always thought that them and their friends were awesome and very fun to hang around with but i had other friends so i never really saw these girls outside school  maybe here and there at birthdays parties or similar  at one point one of the girls asked me to go out to this club with them and their friends which i accepted and was very excited about  i went and it wad a good night  good people good times  then a few weeks later they invited me again just to get drinks with them and their friends  it was like   pm and i worked my ass off the whole day at work up until like  pm and just laid in bed until    trying to relax  i was so tierd i simply told them that i was overly exhausted that night but that we can go another time  which they understood  then some time later they invited me to a birthday suprise party for their friend who was kinda my friend as well but they wanted me to come  i wasn t feeling it at all and thought that i wasn t really ment to be there so i said i had other plans  after this they never invited me again  i declined   times and thats it  end  i kinda regret it because i could have been good friends today with all of these people if i simply kept showing up  you can never know when you will need someone in your life so make sure to get along with as many people as you can and make a lot of friends  be a part of a few friend groups not just one  ,0

   psychological life hacks that can help you stand out in social interactions      assume comfort in any interaction    comfort makes people open up easily        pay attention to people s feet when you approach them    when you approach a group of people whilst in a conversation  pay attention to their bodies  if they turn only their torsos and not their feet  it means they are in the middle of an important conversation and they dont want you to interrupt them        whenever you have an argument with someone  stand next to them and not in front of them    you won t appear as much of a threat and they will eventually calm down        whenever you need a favor  open with  i need your help     we don t really enjoy the guilt we feel for not helping someone out        if you want people to feel good  give them validation  rephrase what they just told you    this will make them think that you are a good listener and that you are really interested in them        if you want to get a positive response from someone  nod while you talk    people usually respond well to mimicking  so they will most probably nod back while you talk        want to see if someone is paying attention to what you are saying  fold your arms    if the other person pays attention  they will most likely emulate your action        having trouble remembering names  repeat the other person s name during the conversation    repeating helps you remember        if you ask someone a question and they only partially answer  just wait  they will keep talking    if they finish their response without providing a full answer  just wait  stay silent and retain eye contact         people usually focus on the emotion and not on the subject    make sure to be enthusiastic and to try and evoke emotions         confidence is way more important than knowledge    confidence makes people feel secure around you         fake it till you make it    you are what you believe you are         if you want to be persuasive  try and reduce the use of the words  i think  and  i believe     these words do not convey confidence         a clean and organized environment affects your mood and productivity    you feel revitalized and calmer         want to find out which people are close to each other within a group   pay attention to the people who look at each other when everyone in the group laughs at a joke     people will instinctively look at the person they feel closest to within the group         when you call a person you want to meet  show excitement    excitement is contagious         want to build rapport and gain respect  match body language    if you want to get someone s attention  the best thing to do  when you approach them  is to match their body language         when someone insults you  either ignore them or mock them  never lose temper  always control the frame    arguing is a waste of time  but if you want to argue never lose your temper         stand up straight  have warm hands and always keep eye contact    these are all demonstrations of confidence         the benjamin franklin effect    a person who has done someone a favor is more likely to do that person another favor than they would be if they had received a favor from that person              if you want to read more on the topic  you can check out my article  here  https   thequintessentialmind com psychological life hacks    ,0
for those of you having a hard time right now  you are not the person your thoughts are telling you right now  you are worth it to keep pushing forward  here is my personal experience and some words of encouragement to help you get through this  edit  i honestly can t believe how much this post has blown up  and how much support it has received  something came up at work and i ve been super busy  but i am trying to reply to each of your messages  i want to thank everyone that has posted and shared your own experiences  it s very comforting to know we can all support each other through this sub  you all are amazing  and it has given me restored faith in people       for those of you that are having a rough go at to lately  i want to try and provide some positive words to help you get through  i am also currently experiencing some major emotional turmoil  and i feel like i need to say it in order to help myself  as well as try and help those that are feeling similarly  i want everyone to know that you are not alone   first  i thought i would start with my personal experience and the pain i have been experiencing  a couple months ago  i really fucked up  i hurt two people in my life who i really deeply care about  i was impulsive  selfish  and broke trust in relationships i truly valued  ultimately  i hurt a lot of people  including myself  and made a complete ass of myself because i believed i was being open and honest about feelings i had  except now  because everything blew up in my face  i have been embarrassed  heartbroken  ashamed  and i have been constantly dwelling on how i wish i had done things differently  and to really drive the pain home  i tried to reconcile and take blame for everything that occurred  i truly apologized  but received nothing in return  i have been forgotten  and that has been very difficult to deal with  everyday for almost two months  i replay in my head every embarrassing thing i have done  thing ive said  and what has led to the position i am in now  i used to not be like this  but based on this  traumatic event   as my therapist has coined  i have turned into an incredibly anxious and depressed person  i no longer enjoy things i had previously  i am trying to heal  but sometimes it feels almost impossible  since this happened  i have been getting extensive help through therapy  my therapist and i have focused a lot on the decisions that had been made that led up to this  event    as i have been trying to find closure and rationalization in why this happened  overall  she believes i am being too hard on myself and that my self loathing is unjustified  she says the decisions i made leading to this were directly influenced by decisions the others in the situation also made  ultimately  she believes i was brave for what i did and that i told the truth and was honest  but i dont ever feel this way  i feel like an idiot for everything ive done  therapy has been helpful  yet no matter how much i try and find self compassion  per her suggestion   after my sessions  i plummet and go back to the berating and self deprecation  i hate myself for the decisions ive made and the amount of pain i have caused  but what really hurts  is i dont love or recognize myself anymore  i used to be this reassured  somewhat self confident person  now i loath my existence everyday i wake up  some days are better than others  but the general trend is worthlessness and shame    this pain that i feel everyday has been a constant battle  im exhausted  but  even though i feel this way  i know i need to keep fighting  that is because i am very thankful for my mom and best friend  who have been incredibly supportive through all of this  i was talking to my mom last night and she told me something that i really needed to hear  and i feel others who are like me  need to hear  the bad  self deprecating thoughts you have about yourself and your situation do not define you  you need to fight to find self compassion for yourself  you are human and sometimes you will do something really stupid and really fuck up  but this doesnt mean you are a bad person in any way  you are only human and in order to heal  you need to become more selfish  what do i mean by this  you need to put your feelings at the forefront and stop worrying about people who you cannot change how they feel about you  worrying about other peoples feelings will get you nowhere  one of my favorite songs lyrics by hymns from nineveh says   an old man said   live one day at a time  who can add a day to his life by worrying     whenever i start worrying and developing the self deprecating thoughts  and projecting other peoples feelings about me  i listen to this song  worrying doesnt get you anywhere and will only hurt yourself  when you find yourself having these horrible thoughts  really try and change the narrative  you are not the person your thoughts are making you out to be right now   they are untruthful beliefs you are holding onto  when you feel the horrible thoughts coming  try and rethink this belief  for example  if you start thinking   i feel worthless for everything ive done   try and change it to something positive  such as   i have weaknesses  but i am not worthless because i have people that care about me  people still enjoy my company and want to talk to me   i started doing this only this morning  my mom suggested it last night   and was already able to talk myself out of a  shutting down  episode  i am now looking forward to using this more frequently because i can tell my mood was able to improve more quickly than other days    lastly  i want to say one last bit of encouragement  you are worth it to fight through this  you have people that care about you and will love you no matter what decisions you make  it will take time and forgiveness to get to this point  but the people in your life that truly care and want you to succeed will be there through it all  they will help fight for you  because they love you  please dont ever forget this  this way  you know you are not alone  there a lot of people that are going through some serious shit  it really sucks  but you need to know you will get through it  there are people in your life that care about you and want you to succeed  you are not defined by the bad thoughts you keep telling yourself  always remember this

useful social skills that can be picked up quickly  here are my    ideas        look people in the eyes          smile          ask questions    but dont kill another person with them as if inspector is investigating on them  rather  show genuine interest for other persons life and experiences        dont talk too much    when someone tells a story  stop your urge to follow up with an example from your own life  rather say   wow  thats cool         when you introduce someone  make him or her a superstar     this is my friend tom  i met him at my first workplace and he saved my ass when i had my first project deadline  i cannot imagine what would have happened without him         try to remember names    i know most of the people emphasize they are terrible at remembering names  but it is skill as any other and can be picked up quickly  ask new person to repeat the name if you havent heard  repeat loudly after them  ask mutual friend later for the help in the case you forget  people really like when you remember their names  it is worth some practice        make a silent break    it will make you more persuasive and confident  people really like that  dont be tempted to explain same thing   times or to fill every break with talk  short breaks are very powerful        when someone is interrupted in the midst of the story  ask that person to continue     hey  can you please finish your story about bicycle ride  the last thing you mentioned is that dog started following you and then someone made an interruption  can i hear the rest please   people love this  they feel uncomfortable when their stories are interrupted and this hack will give them a feeling that they are appreciated and heard        dont complain    we all know those people  i like to call them  energetic vampires  because they suck your energy  that cannot stop whining and complaining about everything  from their latest project to political situation in laos  complaining is repellent for people  whenever you start complaining  try to change the channel         one of my favorite spiritual principles to live by is to always try to leave everything in better condition than i found it    offices  apartments  hotel rooms  cities and yes  peoples hearts  after every interaction  ask yourself   did i leave this person in better condition than i found him or her  did i uplift  inspire  empower him or her  did i cheer him up  did i make her laugh  did i give some love and support   if you approach social interactions with this simple intention  you will always know what to do  all other social hacks are just tools   i hope that this answer inspired and empowered you  ,0

anyone else get that feeling  usually in big groups  of wow i just don t want to talk to these people  i d like to want to get to know these people  i d like to want to play games and have fun with them  but i have no desire and no energy to  like i was fine alone by myself at least  but also i was almost lonely  i used to get this feeling and be concerned because it s quite scary not even having the want to connect with others  it s not constant but i used to feel it fairly often  haven t felt it in a good while  like over a year    but if i did i wouldn t be scared now because i d know it s not permanent but dude it s scary at first  ,0
i highly recommend mma or brazilian jiu jitsu for building social skills  and helping to develop you overall as an individual if youre lacking in social skills  you should definitely try mma  and if you arent comfortable going fully fledged with that  then doing just brazilian jiu jitsu is an option that shouldnt be passed up   people from all backgrounds and personality traits do it and i recommend it for four main reasons      physical touch   getting comfortable with physical touch helps to break down psychological barriers that weve got that make other people seem intimidating or scary  once we start physically touching others in a friendly manner with their consent  that barrier degrades and erodes over time and we feel more connected to people  thats at least my experience     martial arts skills   they can help to improve our confidence and levels of comfort in social situations     physical fitness      is amazing for multiple reasons  it reduces stress  is good for your brain  is amazing for your body  helps you live longer  and helps you to feel happier throughout the day     brotherhood  and sisterhood    you can also start to feel over time that you belong to a tribe and start to feel inseparable from some of these people  those same people you started training with see you grow and develop over time in both your martial arts skills and in your personality and you can sense their happiness at your growth and seeing you come to the gym consistently    i will note that it can be scary at first especially if youve never participated in team sports or done martial arts but honestly  sometimes just putting yourself out there in life in general helps you to build resilience and mental toughness  and you will honestly thank yourself later after taking the risk   hopefully some of you out there start taking a bjj or martial arts class  you might just love it    ,0
im a recovering awkward person  my mind used to go blank constantly  here are some lessons that took me    years     k conversations to learn  r socialskills preface  do these ring true for you    my mind goes blank     i just don t have anything to say     my mind shuts off and jumps into panic mode when the conversation goes quiet    what follows is the answer to those questions  and the lessons  i ve learned from talking to over   k people over    years  http   www becomemorecompelling com    yes i tracked it conservatively   enjoy  and most importantly    take action after reading    if you catch yourself saying   yeah  i already know some of this stuff   stop  ask yourself   how many times have i been actively practicing improving my social skills over the last month    action always trumps information  get a just enough info  then go take action  this is what separates the people who improve their social skills rapidly  and the people who just read r socialskills and comment about why how solution x would never work for them   typically code for   im uncomfortable trying                            part    mindsets    a  the spotlight isn t really on you  theres this jerk of a concept called the spotlight effect  in short  we tend to place more importance on ourselves in any given social situation  if we spill ketchup on our pants  were sure that not only did everyone notice  but they are live tweeting about it as well  the silver lining  most people are too busy thinking about themselves to care about your stained pants   b  adapt  the conversation might change abruptly  someone might interrupt you  its okay  its not the end of the world  when things change suddenly  remember rule a  it s not all about you   c  empathy  this is a big one  before you approach your co worker about something they dropped the ball on    did you take a second and actively try to see the situation through their eyes  no  well   do that first  empathy is important because it influences the intention of your interactions  humans are smart  we can pick up on subtext   d  learn how to small talk in groups  when you turn on the stove to boil water  it takes a few minutes for the water to heat up enough to start boiling  many people will think things like   ugh  i hate small talk  i prefer having a deeper conversation    they are missing the point of small talk  small talk is getting you to a place where you can go deeper  not only does small talk have a point  it s a crucial basis for building a relationship    how make conversation feel effortless and natural   a  the beginner s mind   james altucher   i ask questions  whenever i am on someone else s podcast  i ask questions  if i learn one thing  then it s a win for me  whenever i am meeting someone for the first time  i ask questions  i am more confident asking questions and learning than i am answering them  because of the math  there are more questions than answers in the world  i think godel proved that  i think someone did  a math person  so it s easier to come up with questions  it s easier to say   i know nothing  i am confident knowing nothing  the world is mine to explore  so let s begin now    and i am like lawrence in the desert  it s hot  it s vast  it looks the same in every direction  i can take one step at a time  and move forward and eventually get to the other side  i m confident i can do that  plus people want to talk to the person who wants to listen     side note  listen to james altucher s podcast to hear him ask questions    b  avoid debbie downer topics  keep the energy level up especially near the beginning of conversations  have you ever been in a conversation with someone and they immediately lay this gem on you    so i had to put my dog to sleep yesterday    everyone starts scooting away slowly while murmuring  oh  i m sorry    even worse  no one will be able to switch topics because they dont want to seem insensitive  boom  just like that  you have a downer black hole  nothing escapes  not even light   conversations are typically full of light banter  especially at first   no one ever thought to themselves   oh  i wish someone would bring us down a little   we re having too much fun    a solid strategy to never getting that awkward vibe from a group is simple   match peoples energy  then add       how to increase your energy level  be enthused  i have a friend named tim  tim has the ability to get excited about almost anything  if you tell him about some new thing you re doing or trying  he ll get excited along with you   he rides that wave with you  it s infectious  even if you dont know much about that particular topic  if you show enthusiasm  people will love you  as a general rule  here are some topics to avoid    death    religion    gun control  unless youre at a nra meeting     politics  unless you re drunk at christmas  and you just want to stir some shit up    how this country is or isnt going to hell in a handbasket    your weird rash  unless youre at the doctor   you might be thinking  but i talk about death and religion all the time and i do fine    im sure you do   remember these are general guidelines to help people have easy conversations that help them connect with others  do these things  and you ll be ahead of     of people when it comes to people skills                           part    starting conversations    i used to be painfully bad at starting conversations   fast forward    years     i ve started conversations with   k people   yes i tracked it conservatively  what changed  i knew i had two options     keep doing what i ve always done   and keep getting the same results  and wonder why the world didnt change for me      try out new ways that i could make myself more comfortable with starting conversations   when you change small things  over time you get big results  and also  the more you practice anything the better you get at it   did tying your shoes suck at first  hell yes  i hated it   am i great at tying my shoes    years later  hell yes  now its automatic   let get you some more conversational at bats so you can practice more        conversational muscle memory     step    leave your house  you have to be around people for this to work   step    start tiny      minute  conversations throughout your day   low stakes  the more tiny conversations you have  the easier starting those conversations will be    but who do i talk to    everyone you typically come in contact with  the barista at the coffee shop  your doorman  the mail carrier  the waitress at lunch  bob from accounting    but what do i say    this actually matters a lot less than you think  there is no perfect line  a good rule of thumb  what the person is doing  wearing  or something in the setting youre both in   more on making a first impression   have a exit strategy  no one wants to feel stuck in a conversation  an easy script to politely end the conversation is   ive got to run  it was nice meeting you  name    bonus  having an exit plan will make you feel more comfortable jumping into those conversations   the powerful thing about conversational muscle memory is you ll start small at the beginning of your day and build momentum as the day goes on  with each tiny conversation you re actually doing two things at once      you re building the skill of starting conversations     newton s first law  an object in motion stays in motion  you re building momentum so that you can start conversations throughout your day  at      pm  if you havent talked to anyone all day  do you think it will be easy or difficult to start one conversation  probably not   at      pm  if youve started       conversations  itll be natural to start just one more   stop trying to move a huge boulder when you could move pebbles instead   bonus part    thinking on the fly and banishing awkward pauses forever  here are two methods that will both help you banish awkward pauses and take away the pressure of carrying the conversation   forever      the spokes method     the spokes method will help you connect with anyone on any topic  even if you don t know much about the current topic  imagine a bicycle wheel   in the middle you have a hub  and radiating out from the hub are several spokes   now  imagine the hub as the conversational topic  the spokes are different  related topics that can be introduced   example  your friend brings up star wars   which you have no interest in  but you want to continue the conversation   friend   have you seen the new star wars movie    star wars gives me several spokes to play with    movies coming out this year   space   what it would be like owning a light saber in real life   how harrison ford is basically the terminator  google harrison ford plane crash   example friend   so ive recently gotten into pumpkin carving      what designs are you thinking about carving      do you have any pictures you can show me      i bet the intricate designs are really difficult     i cant wait for halloween  one year i went as marty mcfly  but people just thought i was a homeless person     whats your favorite part about carving    the key here is knowing that you have options  you can either go broad  or go narrow in your spokes   test it out  theres no wrong way to do it unless you start talking about a completely different topic   which you wont because you are smart   as you practice  youll get more calibrated to individual situations   spokes is great because its a win win   a win for you because you get to have a great  engaging conversation without awkward silences   a win for them because  spoiler alert  other people love talking about themselves and will leave the conversation thinking that you are awesome   whew   that was a lot  who am i  im a  recovering awkward person  http   www becomemorecompelling com   i hope this helps you have better conversations with your fellow humans  good things happen when you open your mouth     remember  get just enough info  then take action                          edit   ha  i totally forgot the  nd method     the loop method     listen observation open ended question  think of the loop method as a way to create a positive feedback loop during conversations   it also helps you remain present because this method forces you to remain an active participant in conversations   lets break down the different components of the loop method     listen    think about the last time you felt listened to   now think about the last time you were talking to someone who seemed  spring loaded  with something to say as soon as you were done speaking   which person should you rather have a conversation with   the best conversationalists know that listening is the number one skill you can cultivate   why   listening is a powerful way to foster a connection between two people   and listening goes beyond the standard  active listing  stuff that largely doesn t matter  if you re actually listening  you ll nod and say things like  i see   automatically       observations    an added component to listening is the observation  observations do two things at once   show the other person that you listened  forces you to stay present in the conversation because you re literally commenting on something the other person said   example   wow  i bet moving across the country was exciting      open questions    this is some ninja level stuff right here  asking open ended questions is an insanely useful  yet easy to learn skill that will put you in the top    of conversationalists instantly   open questions can t be answered with a yes or no  they require a more in depth answer   here s what that might look like tied on the end of the earlier observation   wow  i bet moving across the country was exciting   why san francisco    this begs for a longer discussion  and in a group setting you re actually giving people a platform to tell the group more about themselves   it s like you re a late night talk show host and you ve got multiple guests on your show   other examples of open questions    why xyz    what was that moment like for you    how did you get into xyz    how did you meet xyz    how do you go about doing xyz    why did you want to do xyz   the loop method and the spokes method are powerful ways to keep the conversation going so that you create a deeper connection with people  ,0

before you attempt to work on developing your social skills  try creating habits that promote a positive attitude and lifestyle  you may be surprised at the results that come naturally     hours of sleep  healthy meals daily  any form of exercise   cutting your social media time  sticking to a schedule  any healthy habits you can create can be so life changing and help with social anxiety or related issues so much  eating healthy and getting lots of sleep especially i find are so beneficial to your mental health that even if you do still struggle with your social interactions  this is an incredibly important place to start  i see a lot of people overlooking the foundation of a healthy life and just want the  quick fix  for social interactions but it doesn t exist  it takes time  i hope i can help and good luck   ,0

does anyone else find they can be a social butterfly in customer service because you dont really care  but jam up with people you want to be friends with because you do care what they think  basically as the title says    i can charm anyone when im at work and i never have to see them again    but my co workers or people i want to be friends with i think and care too much about what i say    does anyone else get this  ,0
does anyone else wait for others to finish talking before you talk  i know obviously you re not supposed to talk over the other person  but what i mean is that when i m in a conversation with a group  i always make sure no one is going to talk for at least a few seconds before i talk  like it s like i wanna prioritize the other people wanting to talk before myself if that makes sense  and this always ends up with me not saying a word because everyone is just talking and having a conversation normally while i m trying to time when i should jump in  i know there s no right or wrong way of having a convo but what should i do next time  ,0

i finally had the courage to talk to the girl i always seem to bump into  this girl and i have been bumping into each other over the last   months or so   firstly  it was on the bus back in       when there werent any seats left but the one next to her  we didnt talk or anything  but that was the first time  our next encounter was at the bookshop in the town square  i was simply minding my own business in the poetry section when all of a sudden  she appeared next to me and also began to browse through the books  this time  i was genuinely surprised to see her again since i live relatively close to the city and a lot of people do too and its strange to see the same person twice  it actually made me all flustered and nervous  we spoke very briefly about different poetry books and she recommended me one  the third time i bumped into her was at the park  i was sitting under the tree to get away from the sun and she had just arrived from somewhere and decided to sit a fair few meters ahead of me  it keeps going on like this for the next couple of months at various locations   i dont know if its because i became aware of her but she just happened to be where ever i was  so yesterday  after actually seeing her again in the bookstore  i mustered up the courage and went up to her  i thought that it couldnt be a coincidence  especially after all of these encounters  i felt like we were meant to be friends or something  im not even sure myself but i just felt that i had to introduce myself   i thanked her for the poetry book that she had recommended months ago  and we actually ended up talking to each other for a while  we both got to know each other and spoke a lot about the books that we liked and after all of that  she invited me to grab a coffee with her   im just amazed at what had happened yesterday and also at the fact that i had actually gone up to someone and said something  we added each other on our socials and i might invite her out for a coffee soon   edit  ill definitely post an update of how things are going with us in the future  lets see where this takes me and after seeing all the comments about the netflix series   you    i definitely hope that isnt the case  otherwise rip to me xd but thank you for all the lovely comments   ,0

it happened  we kissed  god  fucking euphoric right now    im so so happy     it happened in the best way i could think of  too    freshman year  in front of the main hall at my college  our orientation group was told that before we kicked off our college careers  two people from the group had to step out  and kiss    neither of those people was me   today  as i was on my second date with the girl from my last post  we walked right in front of the main hall and both of us remembered the story from freshman year    i  now a senior  and her  a sophomore    and it happened  it felt wet  and soft   a month ago  this situation was mentally impossible for me    later  as we were walking back to the car  i admitted to her that that was my very first kiss  at    years old    she was nearly thrown for a loop  and her jaw dropped     what  but youre nice and sweet and actually like intelligent  what on earth has been stopping you     i dont know    there was never anything wrong with me  and there was never anything wrong with you    if youre reading this and are struggling with dating  putting yourself out there  or making friends  get your motherfucking ass out there and just start trying  now   right now  ,0
the main reason i dont talk much with other people isnt because i dont want to  its because i dont know what to say when i start to talk with someone i realize that my life is pretty boring  i have nothing interesting to say to the other person  my brain just freezes  theyre always outside with friends doing stuff and all i can say is that i read books and play video games  i really want to be more talkative but i dont know what to say to people  when other people talk to someone it all comes out so natural and i cant make any deep friendships because of this  all the other people are much more interesting and funny than me  ,0
if you re awkward   like me   just own up to it admit to it  it becomes more of a silly personality trait rather than a flaw  i had a friend who was awkward and she knew it  instead of trying to be  normal  or hide her awkwardness she owned up to it  if she said something weird or did something odd we all knew why  we fully accepted her for it and it become more of a personality trait rather than a flaw she had  i for one have always tried to avoid the  awkward  label  so i never admit to being awkward  but i did the other day and the awkward situation i was in become more lighthearted and humorous  own your shit  ,0
instead of being depressed about not being an extrovert  be happy and embrace your introvert side  like the title says  dont feel like crap because you are not an extrovert  dont get me wrong  you can still go out and socialize  buy what im saying is dont feel bad for being an introvert  its truly a gift to like being alone  being selective of who you talk to  and staying in the house all day  our happiness comes from within  so be happy and dont be hard on yourself  ,0

my girlfriend has been incredible  and now she has friends for the first time  my girlfriend is an aspergirl  she has been challenging herself continuously for   months to talk to people despite her bad anxiety  and now she has friends for the first time  i also pushed her hard tough love   but she mostly did it herself  she has cried a lot and had many anxiety attacks  but her life has improved so much    she created a post in a fb group for girls who seek friends  asking if anyone would meet her  and many girls responded  she was super happy and scared at the same time  this was extremely difficult for her and in the beginning she would use days just to formulate and reformulate each simple message  a few times i would have to  accidentally  send them she was super angry  to prevent the process from stopping completely  and so the other girls would get a reply   this one time  she wrote a message to ask a girl out for coffee and it took hours and hours until it finally got sent  the girl was happy she got asked  and asked when my gf would be available  my gf was so tired from that one message that she tried to suppress even the thought of responding  when i said  arent you going to reply   she started crying  they are good friends now   edit  she had friends when she was little  ,0

 your husband doesnt talk much does he   i accompanied my wife to the doctors office for her first chemotherapy consultation  the nurse walks into the patient room and introduces herself and we all say our hellos  the nurse then begins to explain to us how the chemotherapy sessions work    i am just sitting next to my wife listening intently as the two women exchange questions and answers  since i am not the patient  i figured the best i can do is just listen and be present for moral support  then not even    minutes into the consultation  the nurse stops mid sentence and blurted out  your husband doesnt talk much does he     why would she say this  what would have been the appropriate response  ,0
i have   friends or close family i have nobody to talk to at all  i spend everyday alone in my room the only time i even speak out loud is to my parents  i m thankful i have them but i wish i had someone my age to talk to  i don t even get the point of having a phone because nobody messages me at all  i gave up on the people i used to talk to because i realized i was always the one putting in the effort to talk  i was never anybody s choice when it came to hanging out or having a simple conversation  i never got invited anywhere even to parties  nobody ever thought of me ever  i was the only one trying to talk to them or make plans i m comfortable being alone but even introverts need social interactions sometimes  i just wish i had someone to talk to not even about deep things but just a freaking conversation  it gets so physically lonely knowing that i could die and nobody would know or care except my parents   edit  i wasn t expecting this shitpost to be seen by so many people but thank you all for your messages much appreciated i didn t know so many people could relate to my situation  if anyone is interested in a discord where we can all talk to each other let me know  ,0

i got dragged to a party and was shocked so i was expecting a dozen people for this christmas party  man was i wrong  there was a garage section  upstairs section  kitchen section and living room section  as a person who spends    hours a day in their room playing video games all day this was very intense for me  i was shaking and my friend tried getting me to calm down  eventually i found a nice corner to set up shop and be on my phone  i met this baseball college player and a few of his friends who actually had the same issues i did  this is explains why we  were in one of the corners  then i met a few other people who also were like me  i eventually made a whole   friends that i actually connected well with  long story short i think what i learned is that when in those types of social events  you re not alone  and there are probably a ton of others with intense social anxiety who may not look it  over all i m very happy i went ,0

watching other people interacting so smoothly and effortlessly makes me feel inferior and broken  i am looking at these people that are younger than me and just perfect at interacting while i just sit further from the  fun    it fucks with my head because it shows how far behind i am and it makes me question whether i ever will be normal so that i can blend in and become part of the group   is it even possible for the brain to become adept at social interaction after teenage years   edit  thank you all for so many useful replies  ,0
my trick for accepting compliments and making them laugh  i wear suspenders a lot and often get complimented on them and i know that were told to compliment something on them  but if youre like me  sometimes youre too slow to return a sincere compliment  my trick is to tell them  thank you  my suspenders  or whatever they complimented  like you too    this always gets a laugh  while buying me time to figure out how to compliment them back  but if my mind blanks out  which it does a lot   then i dont feel awkward  because it was still a good interaction  of course  saying it cheerily with a smile and laugh helps sell it  but i genuinely find the comment humorous making it easier to do so  ,0

people who grew up with sh t parents  please dont fret  you actually have a social intelligence leg up that you just arent aware of yet  long post  personal perspective  little sprinkles of advice       update    not to be that person thats like       wow  this blew up           but this post got a bit more traction than i expected  thank you to everyone who has commented or pmed me your kind words and input  im going to start posting regularly on this sub and some adjacent subs because if every few times i post  one person benefits from or finds new perspective in what i have to say  thats pretty damn cool  im not      sure how being able to see specific users posts on your feed works on reddit  im more of an ig gal  sorry    but if you want to keep up to date on anything new i post  i think you can follow me  i think i have   followers on here    i didnt know you could do that lol  i stumbled upon this sub today and joined it because i    f  actually might end up being a member that can be an advice provider instead of a question asker  unlike most of the other subs ive joined  lmao   which is a cool feeling  hopefully what i write here might resonate with or make someones life a little bit better      i saw  this top post  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments heeyhm life is disproportionately unfair to people who   about how life is disproportionately unfair to people who have been raised by bad parents  and while i definitely agree with the sentiment as someone who is already estranged from two of the three parental figures ive had in my life at the age of    for very good reason  i wanted to offer my perspective  as i do feel like under the wrong personal circumstances  i wouldnt be particularly filled with hope for my future social success after reading that post  and might leave feeling a bit more defective and isolated as a person than i started off  which is no bueno     some background on my perspective     i was raised by a mother with borderline personality disorder and an ex stepdad who left in my teens  and was consistently emotionally and financially abused by mother dearest for my entire life  to the point where i was straight up told i was a bad  selfish  and terrible human being on an almost daily basis for the first    years of my life  my self esteem was in the earths molten core  all of my emotional and mental patterns were disregulated af because i only had bpd thought and emotional patterns modelled to me  and my social skills were terrible  because literally all i knew how to do was manipulate people to a  keep them as far away from me as possible  and b  play little games with them because i didnt know how to connect with people in an actual meaningful way and truly didnt understand what positive purpose to human interaction there could be  it sucked  majorly  i hated my life  then  i had a personal paradigm shift when i was    due to a personal tragedy  and pulled a complete     in my life   now  not only am i immensely grateful to be living a life thats filled with fantastic friendships  fulfilling work  personal growth and self exploration  and amazing adventures  but im that friend that literally   all   of my friends have asked   how do you do it   like  a few months ago  i guess before covid because i saw these people in person  i had between   and    friends in separate situations  completely unprovoked  tell me how much ive positively influenced their lives to the point where they all cried  within a week of each other  it was a mind blowing  humbling experience  and it made me realize that i actually had some majorly kickass social skills  because not only was i able to make and keep friends and function properly in social situations  but i was actually doing it in a way that was bettering the lives of all of these people i was interacting with  and i dont think i would have been able to develop social skills so above and beyond the norm had i had a  normal   good upbringing     the advice y part  some thoughts to keep in mind if youre feeling down on yourself or pissed off at the world for not getting to experience a happy  loving family  because weve all been there      first of all  if you dont want to be hindered by your lack of regulated emotional thought patterns and or proper social skills experience  you are going to need to do some major grunt work to re learn your patterns  im not going to sugar coat it  but i will say that its just like learning an instrument when you already know how to play a similar one  like the bass guitar vs guitar  youre learning the bass guitar  but the hardest part is just reminding yourself that youre playing with four strings now and not six  because you already know where all the notes are on the fretboard      remind yourself gently every day to take a moment or two to analyze your thought patterns  and the more you do this  the better youll get at being aware of what youre feeling and how youre acting while youre doing the feeling or acting  for example  as i started to get better at observing my emotional responses to things  i was able to recognize that i was tying together feelings like anger and sadness with guilt and shame  even if there was no logical reason for me to be feeling guilt and shame    start googling your parents or familys behaviour  and honestly  get really into playing web psychologist for a while  itll help give you a more objective perspective of your fams disregulated patterns and help you recognize them in your own behaviour  just be aware of the fact that you arent actually qualified to make a diagnosis  and your research is a learning tool for you   to clarify  my mother is diagnosed  but googling  children of parents with bpd   as well as similar disorders  was mind blowing for me     recognize that you arent broken  youre just mistrained  then cesar milan the sh  t out of yourself  become your you whisperer  reward positive thought patterns  reject negative ones  and then reward yourself for rejecting them   ok  now that ive addressed the setbacks of having a shitty fam and a lil bit of how you can work through them  lets talk about the silver linings     realistically  youre a lot more independent than you would be if you had a nice  cushy upbringing  you know what hard times look like  you know youve gotten through them  and that means you can be an actually helpful  beneficial friend to have when the going gets tough for your future friends  which not everyone has the perspective to be able to do  i have friends ten years my senior ask me for marriage relationship advice  and i can actually give helpful insight  because i have an absurdly broad amount of perspective for a    year old  im the advice friend  plus  being the advice friend has another benefit  which is that it makes the hardships youve endured become a bit more meaningful  because youre able to draw from the pain you endured to make someone else that you care abouts situation a little less painful for them    you can think more critically and creatively because youve had to question societal norms your whole life  its a mindf  ck for a kid to not have their home be their safe space when thats what they see on tv and in their classmates lives  but i can guarantee that you have a much more realistic view of the world than you would if you lived a life that was  the norm   you get to be aware of whats normal and whats not  and thats a really  really important social skill to have  because that means if you pay close enough attention  you can get really good at picking your future friends with confidence that their values align with yours    if you decide to let your proverbial guard down  which i highly recommend working toward   youll probably find that you can develop a really refined sense of empathy  because it will be much easier for you to identify with other peoples hardships due to your own experiences  its one thing to empathize with someone based on an imagined idea of what their circumstance is like  but if life has punched you in the face a few times  youre not going to forget what a cosmic ko feels like  and speaking from personal experience  its having a lot of empathy  and basing your actions toward others on that empathy  that really takes your social skills to the next level  so a refined sense of empathy is basically the blue eyes white dragon of social skills cards   i think    i havent watched yu gi oh  in  ever   im going to stop there for now  even though i think i could probably make a book long super post about how coming from a less than ideal home life can actually be a secret weapon when it comes to social skills  because i think ive argued my point    life can be disproportionately unfair to people who were raised by bad parents  but if youre in a position where you want to actively improve your social skills    which it seems like is why this sub exists     although you will have to unlearn some patterns that wont do you any good  once youve made headway into learning the standard dance steps of how to go along to get along in a social world  youll also find that you have some extra  really useful tools in your social wallet that will ultimately take your social skills to the next level     so please  please please do not think for one second that the fact that you will never be able to be  normal  because of your upbringing is a bad thing  or that it means that youre broken  or unloveable  or just too different or  weird  to be accepted  the fact that you will never be able to be  normal  is actually a really  really good thing  because speaking from experience    being weird with the tools and skills developed to exist symbiotically with normal becomes being special  and its being special that makes the lives of those around you  as well as your own  so awesome and meaningful    ,0
does anyone else feel like they re not experiencing life properly  i feel like i m not  living  properly  i don t socialise nearly as much as i would like to  i don t have those  super close  friends that everyone else seems to have  im so anxious and cautious about everything    i feel like i m not experiencing life correctly and it s really stressing me out  can anyone else relate    i often feel this deep sense of boredom and emptiness    i want to do all these different things  but i m not sure where to start and anxiety holds me back   ,0
i am afraid to reach out to friends after some time of no contact  i don t know how  but i always feel like i am bothering people when i text them and i feel like there would be no point for them to hang out with me  i know it s stupid but that makes me not reach out to people at all as i always think i am just being awkward and nobody wants to hang out with me     any advice on stopping to care so much about what others think  it s not really about being shy but much more about not knowing how to act socially and maintain or build friendships    ,0

this is how to never run out of things to say so  ive been seeing alot of posts regarding running out of things to say when talking to girls  when trying to make friends  when first meeting someone new  etc    heres how to never  ever run out of things to say   i hate suggesting this  but  they do help beginners   some tools you can use when first getting started are finding commonalities with the other person   you can do this by asking some general questions  like what they like to do on their free time  or what brings them here  etc  or by bringing up seemingly relevant topics and discussing this with them    this is great for learning small talk  which is helpful at first but completely and utterly useless long term   do you really want to spend your time learning new shit everyday waiting for the off chance that the person youre talking to knows about cares about that stuff   i definitely dont   the best way to improve this skill is by working on your creativity and presence   get those creative juices flowing through creative thinking exercises such as improv   try meditation  you never know if itll be something you end up enjoying  and  meditation has phenomenal benefits  such as being able to concentrate for longer periods and being able to have a conversation without filtering all of the thoughts going through your mind because youll be present to that moment   start going out and having conversations with random people about random shit  like penguins or the new joker movie you may or may not have seen or liked    most importantly  stop filtering yourself   the reason most people run out of things to say is because they think what comes to their mind is irrelevant or useless to the current conversation  and then they choose not to talk about it   thats bullshit   even if the other person doesnt care about what youre talking about  or finds your thought process to be weird  why should you give a shit   stop overthinking shit   when people overthink  thats when things typically get silent and  awkward    learn to filter yourself as minimally as you can  while obviously practicing social acuity so you dont just say something wildly offensive or something like that  ,0
would it be okay to ask my neighbor if i can walk their dog for free  my neighbors never walk their dog  the dog sits in the garage and looks out through the window all day  i don t think he s allowed to leave  i feel sad for the puppy  but maybe those people cannot find the time to walk their dog    would it be okay to offer to do it for them for free  i really wouldn t mind because i already take my own dog on a walk sometimes  i was thinking of leaving a note with my number on it saying   hello  would you like me to walk your dog for you sometime  i think he ll get along with my dog  ,0

finally told a friend of mine  i had a crush on her  and got rejected  yesterday was great day for me  the new year began and i have fullfiled my first resolution  i was having dinner at a friends house but did not want to come at first  but then he said that my crush would also come so i agreed to his invitation  we sat at the opposite ends of the table and i could not look at her   later we all played some games  it was a nice evening  after some time i went to the kitchen were i told him what i was about to do  i did not want to confess in front of everyone  even though every person in the living room knew i had a crush on her except her  so i sent her two text messages  the first one said that i was serious about what i am writing to her and second one a short direct confession   i have a crush on you   and then waited in the kitchen for her to come   i could not help but smile when she entered  she was baffled   i knew i was about to get rejected  and my goal was it to finally be done with it  her best friend knew that and told her that    and well we laughed a bit and there was also silence maybe she was really thinking about it  i on the other hand couldnt really say much  but she was sorry and we hugged it out  we then went back to the living room like nothing happend  i am glad that i told her  i woke up today after i dreamed of her again  and i know it will take some time  but now i do not feel the need to run after her anymore     i wish everyone a great year    ,0
i dont like people  and this quarantine has been making me happy more than ever  since quarantine started  ive noticed some things about myself  i became happier than usual  i dont even remember that last time that i cried  i also became more confident  especially by the way i look and how i act  and have such a positive outlook in life    thats when i realized  i dont like people  i mean  i dont necessarily  hate  them  i even enjoy socializing sometimes  and i dont get anxious unless im doing something out of my comfort zone  but most of my sudden breakdowns were caused by other people  except for my ingroups  like close friends and family   people are nice to me  and i dont get bullied or anything  but i find myself getting sad whenever im surrounded by other people  i get breakdowns and sometimes  i skip classes just because i dont like seeing others    my friend asked me in the past why i dont like people  and i cant seem to find any answer about this  im also not concerned by it  but whenever someone brings it up  i start questioning myself  even my own family is concerned about the way that i am  especially because im    now and i barely have friends  but im grateful for the ones that i have     im scared that after quarantine and everything goes back to normal  ill get sad again and have breakdowns  does anyone feel like this  ,0
my new girlfriend fell in love with me on our first date  while doing something that s out of my comfort zone  making an effort pays off  tldr  skip to  th paragraph for the point of the post   i just wanted to share something real quick that completely brightened my week  two months ago i had a first date with a girl and was very nervous  since she suggested going to a bar  i even posted about on here beforehand  but deleted it later as i figured i d let the universe do it s thing    i m a very indoorsy person  who much rather go for a coffee and chat than drink and dance  in fact  i had never gone out to a bar to dance before  i had never danced in public  in front of strangers  before  but i figured it would be nice to try it out  and to make a little bit on an effort to get out of my comfort zone with this girl who i was so very excited to go out with   we went out  drank a little bit  talked  and yes  danced  danced together  holding each other and kissing  every step felt awkward and calculated  and moving to the rhythm of the music was far from effortless and natural  but ultimately i enjoyed being there with her  and had fun  the date was a success  we spent   hours together  from the bar to  later  my apartment  and it felt like it was worth it   what i thought would be a one night stand turned into a crush  and into a thing  and into a bigger thing  and  recently  into a relationship   the thing is  yesterday she confessed to me that was the best first date she has ever had  and that she had fallen in love with me that day   something that had never happened to her so quick before  more specifically  what she said stood out to her as the moment she felt made her fall for me was dancing with me   just us  forehead to forehead  in a room with loud music full of sweaty people   so doing something i would generally refuse to do  because i m awkward and bad at it  led this amazing person to feel an important connection that allowed us to be at we are right now  very much in love and growing   sharing this story because it made me very happy  just as a reminder that sometimes things really are worth it  and you can gain much more than you lose by trying something that pushes your social limits  ,0
i went to my first concert alone tonight  my favourite band was playing in my city and they rarely tour in my country  but i no one i know would have been interested in coming  i decided to say screw it  got myself a ticket  and went for it    it was a bit nerve wracking  especially when waiting in line and having no one to talk to  but once we got in and the music started   it was one of the greatest experiences ever   don t pass up an opportunity to do an activity you really want to if you can t find someone to accompany you to it  you may end up having an even better time doing it by yourself   edit  thank you all for the kind words and encouragement support  i never knew it was such a normal thing to go to concerts alone tbh  and a big thank you for my first gold  kind stranger    ,0
i finally asked out the guy im my philosophy class ohmygod you guys i am over the fucking moon right now i can t stop shaking  this just happened   minutes ago and i m in a bathroom stall typing this for all of you    here s a tldr   finally mustered up the courage to ask my crush on a date thanks to the stories on this sub  asked him after lecture and he happily said yes      so i m an    y o f  freshman in college  i met this guy in a philosophy class last semester and thought he was very cute and i loved his personality in class  we were both very diligent and spoke during lecture  i am normally pretty confident and charismatic so honestly speaking to random people isn t an issue for me  it was so different with him though  whenever i was around him  it s like my stomach and heart were doing a full hiit intensity cardio routine inside of me  i d start trembling like a chihuahua around him because i would get so anxious  i made one attempt at getting to know him more and asked him if he wanted to be in a study group  i got his number but conflict in scheduling made it difficult  basically the whole semester passed and no sort of thing happened between the two of us  we kept it light and friendly  we would always cross paths around campus so we d see each other frequently but i could never tell if he liked me or was even single  fast forward to spring semester  we ended up in the same philosophy class again  i was really excited but still couldn t tell if he liked me  the only hint i could pick up is that he was friendly and moved his seat closer to me  i came onto this sub to seek advice but i mostly found posts about guys asking girls out  i tried my best to seed out the good advice  i decided that i can t wait around for that magic moment to happen  i told myself that if he were to say no then no biggie  why would i want to waste my time pursuing someone who has no interest in me  i made the plan to ask him out today after class because we receive extra credit if we attend a play on campus  hahaha i even watched that motivational shia lebouf video before bed last night and it really pumped me up  you will never guess what happened next though    so i go into class today and this dude behind me in class asked me to go with him to the play this weekend  my crush sits right by me so he watched this interaction happen  i was shocked and just quickly said i was working all weekend and couldn t go  phew  class ends and i saw my crush in the library and said hey and we conversed about a quiz we just took and i asked him if he wanted to go to the play with me  he was blushing and said yes  you guys im sooo happy i am so glad i did this  i practiced in the mirror in the morning so that made it easier to do bc i already had an idea of a script to follow  i just had to share this somewhere aaahhh     edit for whoever sees this  went on the date  he didnt tell me till the very end that he actually has a girlfriend  literally what  the fuck  ,0
anyone else struggle with wanting closer friends  but quickly gets tired of the effort you have to put in  ever since i started full time work  i feel like i have no close friends anymore  all my friends now have partners who they dedicate a large portion of their weekend to  as do i with my so since we can only meet on the weekends  other than that  im often so tired from work that all i want to do in my free time is stay home and relax  and have some time to myself  that  or i have to run errands  do chores  grocery shopping  meal prep for the week  etc   however  some weekends my so will hang out with his friends so i end up having a free weekend  i feel embarrassed to say that i just either hang out with my sister  go out alone somewhere or work on my hobbies  i want to go out with friends but also i feel like we have all grown so distant that its not so simple anymore to say  hey wanna meet up this weekend   because i know they have their so and closer friends that are higher on their priority list for the weekend free time   slowly im feeling more and more awkward to reach out  but at the same time  sometimes i reach out and i re connect  but realise how much energy and time it takes to regularly meet up and keep in touch  in the moment i feel like yeah i want closer friends lets reach out but then life happens and i feel like that spark of motivation to be social dies down quickly    anyone else struggle with this  or have any tips  ,0
when i was younger  i used to think i was fine with having no friends  in reality  i was just used to it  didn t know what sub to post this in  i really feel like sharing this    i was that person who used to say  oh  having no friends is nice  i can do whatever i want  go wherever i want  i only have to worry about  my own  opinion  i can read my books in peace   i used to look down on people for  needing  friends  i genuinely saw myself as special for being able to handle solitude  this was when i was    and under  i used to believe that i was just  meant  to have no friends    then i made some friends and spent a lot of time with them  it seriously made me fully realise how actually  depressing  it was to have no friends  i didn t like it  i wasn t fine with it  i was just  used  to it because i had no choice  i deluded myself into thinking i  loved my alone time   i also tend to adopt  weirder  behaviours when i m more isolated because i only have my own opinion to count on    i feel like on reddit  you get a lot of people justifying having no friends because  no drama   but i wonder how many of those people are  actually  happy with having no friends    i ve unfortunately drifted apart from those friends  but their friendship has left a lasting impact on me  nowadays  i put  a lot  more effort into talking to people  if i think someone s kind or i admire them  i reach out and ask if they want to chat more  even if they re    years older than me  or a teacher  i call mental health hotlines if i feel lonely  life is just better when you have people you can talk to about things  lonely people  i urge you to not give up  we are  not  meant to be isolated    this was longer than i intended  but i just felt like sharing  ,0
anyone else feel like theyre in a constant battle with their natural personality  ive always been an unpleasant person  im neurotic  talkative  defensive  self absorbed  and insecure  among a host of other subtle things that have kept me from a truly fulfilling social life   that being said  when i consciously fight it  i can be charming  and i tend to make a pretty decent first impression  but keeping friends has always been an issue  because over time the unpleasantness starts to seep out and people get tired of it quickly   im a social person  and wish more than anything that i was someone with a personality people are drawn to  im tired of meeting cool new people  only to see them fade out of my life like always  im tired  literally tired  from having to constantly suppress who i am   if anyone has felt this way before and gotten out of it  id love to hear what you have to say  ,0
the best way to improve your social skills is by improving your confidence and self esteem first i can t stress enough how important this is  if you don t feel good about who you are it s going to ruin the way you communicate with others  hit the gym  eat healthy  join a club  become passionate about something  it will change your life more then you imagine and you will no longer need this subreddit ,0

something ive noticed about confident people this might be obvious to a lot of you but its something ive just come to realize these past couple of months by talking to confident friends peers and just listening to confident people online on youtube and podcasts  just for background  im someone who has dealt with social anxiety for as long as i can remember   anyways tho  it seems to me like pretty much every confident person goes into situations expecting things to work out and more importantly  when it doesnt  they just move on  ive been trying to live my life with this mindset lately and have already seen big improvements  the opposite of this is having a victim mentality about everything  so basically when things go wrong you kind of just think the whole worlds out to get you and it will always be this way  that couldnt be further from the truth and it took me    years of life to realize that lol  idk tho maybe im just repeating what everyone says but this was a big realization for me  shout out to cox n crendor podcast for basically having this conversation in their most recent episode  ,0
i went to a concert alone and it was awesome my favorite band was having a free gig in town and i was supossed to go with my boyfriend  but then he told me he was going with a few people i didnt know to drink and celebrate someones birthday  whom he doesnt even know well and whose bday was weeks ago    and he told me to join them if i wanted to  i asked if it was okay to come and he just said  idk man  just come a little later and buy your own booze  which upset me a little because i just needed some reassurance    so i decided to ditch him and go myself and honestly i had a great time  me from a few years back never would have done this  but i went alone and had a great time  it was so freeing to get lost in the crowd and just enjoy the music    im learning that doing things alone is okay and that i dont have to depend on aynone for a good time  im enough for myself   edit  wow  this got an overwhelming number of respones  im sorry i cant reply to all of you but if this inspired even one person to try the same thing  then im so happy  i hope you all have a good time  and for those of you who arent ready to do this yet  youll get there  trust me   edit    and thanks for the support   ,0

i finally feel like i am starting to be confident in myself and not give a fuck about what people think of me after  my whole life i have been shy and self conscious about myself  ever since i was little  i was afraid of failing and people judging me  i decided in my mind that the best way not to feel embarrassed or judged was to just avoid all social interaction as much as i could  and my social anxiety got worse as i grew older  i was also homeschooled up until i was in seventh grade and the only kids i knew were my cousins  and some kids at church  i never really knew what it was like to meet new people besides kids i met at the park and our yearly church camp  when i was in  th grade  i didnt have any friends for the first half of the year  recess was the worst thing ever  i didnt know anyone and i just felt like i was in the deep end of a pool and drowning  every day  i just wanted school to be over so i wouldnt have to be around people i didnt know    thankfully  my social studies teacher  who was also the wrestling coach and track coach  kept trying to get me to join wrestling  so i could break out of my comfort zone  he basically forced me to join by peer pressuring me lol  i really did not want to do it  but i am sooo thankful that he did  because that was the first step to me getting out of my microscopic comfort zone  i even made a few friends who are still my friends to this day   when i was in eighth grade  i came to the realization that i needed to come out of my comfort zone to get the things that i want in life  i decided to start challenging myself by going against what my anxiety told me not to do  at school  i would try to talk more with my friends at lunch  and i would try to say hi to my crush every day  and i would just try to challenge my self more and more by doing things that made me nervous  i didnt really start making progress until my freshman year when i felt pretty confident to talk to people    i am now a    year old sophomore in highschool  and my confidence feels like a raging boner  at church camp last year  i found out my crush liked me and possibly some other girls  that boosted my confidence so much in talking to girls and just all people in general  its only been going uphill ever since  we just had a work week thing that i had to go to a few weeks ago for our church camp  and those same girls were there and some older kids from my church that i was to scared to talk to  this time  i decided to just go all in and not give any fucks about what people thought of me  i had some nice conversations with some girls and strengthened my relationships with kids from church that i didnt know that well even though i knew them since i was born  this confidence feels amazing  i can feel it coursing through my veins  i couldnt sleep at all those nights just because i was so excited  thinking about hanging out with people and getting to know people    if you have social anxiety  just try to challenge yourself  do every thing that makes you uncomfortable until you become comfortable with it  it is hard  i know  when i was confident and comfortable  something would happen that would just tear me down and i would have to start over  success isnt a straight line  there are more downs than there are ups  you just have to be willing to push through it and make it happen  if you do something embarrassing or awkward  dont beat yourself up over it  just say fuck you to your anxiety and just forget about it  it happens to everyone  just accept it and move on  ,0

does anyone else feel like they dont belong anywhere  i feel like i have no close friends   i have no core group of people i hang out with   no one invites me anywhere   no on texts me   no one calls   no one asks me to go out and do anything   i spend most of my time alone   i spent years trying to make plans with  friends  but everyone always had other plans or they flaked out   ive always been the one who put in all the work   all my relationships have been one sided   just this evening i was at the fair in my hometown   so of course i knew a large portion of the people there   i went alone as per usual   everyone was already in their groups hanging out   or with their boyfriend or girlfriend   everyone had their main friend group that they made plans with   sure  i would make small talk with a few people i know but they would only talk for a minute and then they would say they had to go   simply translated they had other people they would rather talk to   so i spent most of the evening walking around alone until i felt like a loser and just went home   i just truly feel like i have a lot of acquaintances and no real friends   i am friendly and i have been told i am funny and the nicest person ever   maybe thats the problem   i am too nice   i really dont know   it seems like no one values me   i am    and it is just getting harder to make friends   i am just feeling lonely tonight and needed to vent   does anyone else feel the way i do  ,0
 you wouldn t care so much about what other people think of you  if you knew how little they did  i may not have gotten the phrase accurately but it sure did help me during tough times of self consciousness ,0

anyone else hate being told they re quiet  on a few occasions before i ve been told i m quiet but i feel i m more of a listener and like to hear what people are saying in a group instead of always chatting  i m a student nurse working on ward placements at hospitals and i m    years old  i d say my confidence has grown a lot since last year but the other day a patient said i looked  lost  a few days before   it was my first day on the ward  and i explained i was a second year etc and she thought i was first year and replied by saying a few times over   it s just because you re quiet    this may not seem like a a big deal to anyone but it s knocks my confidence when people say this especially because i ve been trying to be more loud and chatty to make an effort and i feel when people say i m quiet it s offensive to me  anyone else get this as well    any ideas to overcome this or whatever thanks a lot     edit    wow guys   i never expected to get so much feedback   i m so grateful for each person sharing their story  i m reading through every one  and taking on board your suggestions   i really hope this helps not only me but other who have been in the same situation   please keep  your thoughts coming   i love reading them as i m sure the rest of us do   thanks again     ,0
sometimes when i go out i feel lonelier than if i had just stayed home im not sure if im posting this for advise  or just to rant  but i needed to get this off my chest  sometimes rather than staying home i want to go out to bars  or local events  ive gotten to know a lot of the regulars  but most of the time i still feel like an outlier  like im just the acquaintance among groups of friends  and no one really cares whether i was there  or not  sometimes it makes me feel more lonely when surrounded by people than if i had just stayed home by myself  like i said not quite sure what advice i was looking for  but just had to get that off my chest  ,0
i found a cool way at making your conversations more fun and interesting  so i saw post earlier about someone having trouble with having fun and interesting conversations  and i ve started to have the same problem with talking with my parents   one way i think will make it easier for all of us to have more fun and interesting conversations  is imagine conversations as the you and the other person making a story  and you know nothing at all  for example  you re with your friend or coworker  and they re talking about how much they loved to draw back in high school    imagine them drawing something  but you don t know what they could be drawing  instead of saying to them    oh that s cool   ask them  what did they use to draw back then    or even make an assumption or tease them saying  i bet you made a bunch of stick figures back then    now you added more to the story that you and your friend are making    you and your friend can keep continuing the story or can make a whole new story  just like continuing with the same topic or bring up another new topic  ,0
people think im a freak and its killing me inside today  my professor publicly called me out for being silent  he said   youve been quiet from the first time ive met you  do you not have any friends   since the moment he said that  ive been ruminating and sulking    his words reminded me that on the outside i appear very weird awkward because i am an anxious person and also because i hate myself  the reason why its obvious that he thinks im a freak is because i have other classmates who are outwardly quiet but dont get any shit from him    its clearly unique to my shitty verbal communication skills and body language  i hate when people say stuff like to this to me so much because i genuinely dont have the energy to change  i am depressed and even showing up to college is a struggle  ,0
loneliness doesnt come from a lack of friends family loved ones it comes from not being able to find what you should be doing and love to do   im trying really hard not to sound like one of those pinterest posts but people take things differently so heres my spin on this   once i found what i wanted to do  i didnt give a crap about not having anybody to hang out with  stopped scrolling through dating apps  and waiting for the timezone to switch so i could call my family on the other side of the globe  i stopped being hurt when i wasnt invited to parties  couldnt give a fuck when my neighbors were partying really hard next door  and spending endless hours on youtube   i was so busy being so happy in my realm of work   i went from a very awkward  unfriendly person to a passionate individual engrossed in my work  like minded people saw this and approached me and made my work even better  and became my friends and family  finding my purpose led me to finding friends   its the lack of purpose in life that leads to loneliness  not the lack of people  which means you are in control of the situation                                                         edit  i realize i shouldve taken a step further   finding the work i love is not the finish line  finding my purpose has created my marathon  because i know the job i have and the work i do will help me fulfill this purpose i have  i now thoroughly enjoy it and give it all ive got   my work teaches me how to think  how to understand  how to solve problems as an engineer  it teaches me how to talk properly to people  how to act in social situations  respect my surroundings and do the right thing  the way i talk to a friend should be different from how i talk to the ceo  the way i dress to a party should be different from how i dress at a business meeting  these kinds of things cannot be picked up by reading a book  it comes from gaining experience through work   the biggest thing ive gotten out of having a job is picking up the ability to discern right from good and right from bad  this is why i love my job and this is how i use it to better myself  my work fulfills my purpose at the moment because its teaching me to become a functional human being that can contribute positively to my surroundings   your purpose doesnt have to be this huge grand thing  for me  its just to better myself everyday so i can be ready when opportunities come to me  so i can be of better use when somebody needs me  my skillsets  my ideas  and my mindset   edit       purpose   what you should be and want to be doing   loneliness   not having anything enjoyable and valuable to do   how do you find your purpose  maybe this question will help  my  op s soft purpose  for now  is to find an answer to the following   a lot of peoples aim goal in life is to become rich  how will you spend every cent of   billion dollars in your limited lifetime  you cannot invest it  how will you use your investments when you are dead  how do you want to spend every penny of   billion dollars while you are alive  this should be your purpose   edit     people  of course you wont be happy just by finding work you love  im starting to realize how lacking i am in formulating ideas into words xd  the purpose of this post is not to say   find a great job you love and youll be happy even all alone in chernybol     nope  its to say   find the steps that will take you to achieving your grand purpose   for most of us  it will be taking up a job in society and earning a salary  for some of us  it will be traveling all around the world  for many  it will be going to school and graduating  there will be many others who find their own pathways                                                     final edit   for everyone taking the liberty to twist this post to reply   people cant live without meaningful relationships    loving your job isnt enough    yess lets all just ignore hoomans around us    lol u nuts  you mean  escape this painful world that is lyfe by entirely throwing yourself into werk     i urge them to reconsider  i have never once said that       finding a job you love guarantees happiness         finding a job you love is all thats necessary        youll totes be okay if you have work you love  even if youre in fucking chernobyl with only uranium ions to be your comrades     its problematic if thats what youve eagerly taken from this post  the following is a very diluted tl dr      working towards a goal contingent with the people and or for the society around you  leads  to meaningful relationships  finding a job work you love is the first step that triggers this      loneliness doesnt come from a lack of relationships  does not mean  just live alone and still be happy because you have work to do      there are tons of people who are lonely even while surrounded by people   in order for you to be part of a community  youd better damn be doing something for them     learn about your surroundings to be a person fit for that environment  this includes being street smart  being cultured  and open minded   thanks for taking the time to read     x   b  ,0
the curse of the  good kid  guys  do you know about the weird phenomenon of the good kid  that gets praised all the time by the teachers  i was that kid for some years and i want to know if anyone here can relate to this  i gonna talk about this from my view now so the good kid is the kid that does not harm to anybody  is well behaved and does his work  i talk about the time from adolescence to early or middle of adulthood  so the good kid is seen as the gold child by his teachers because he follows the orders  he then believes that this behavior is right  hes not like the other kids  who try to have fun and act rebellious  they are extroverted and assertive compared to the good kid  who is too passive  the passiveness  that the thing that holds back the poor kid  and the worst thing is that teachers think thats how the quiet kid is but its not  i for example have experienced anxiety and really deep fear  that prevented me to be social and carefree  it breaks you  you cant not fully enjoy being a teen    it does have an huge effect  because the good kid does not get the social experience and he gets  left behind   then some years later it gets weird  the praising stopped  and he gets called weird and creppy  even arrogant cuz of his shyness   nobody likes you at     kills him mentally  he is directionless  cuz he was always dependent  maybe his parents were overprotected  and they wonder why their child is not able to stand up for himself  because he was taught to  obey  the adult  so no talking back   he then realizes that his personality is uninteresting and his social skills are rock bottom  working world does make him a stranger  because you have to be social and have good network to track yourself through it  all these things until he breaks down and realizes that the  good kid  phenomenon made him miss out  at the end he meets one of his former teachers  who says how much of a good kid he was in class     thanks  it was the anxiety     then he goes away and the teacher moves his eyebrows  not having a clue what he said or meant  ,0

ive realised my friends arent there for me because i wasnt there for them  ive had a gradual realisation that i never actually reached out to my friends outside of school  with exception to inviting them to play videogames  even there i stopped that because i felt i was annoying them  now theyve grown closer as a group and sonehow i almost feel like an outsider    i guess take this as a lesson for yourself  but at the same time  im just racking my brain to figure out if i can solve this disconnect  any help would be greatly appreciated  edit  i finally got the confidence to reach out to some of my mates  itll be a slow process but one well worth it i think  you guys are awesome  ,0
how do i tell my roommate that we don t have to have a conversation every time we see each other around the house  without sounding like an asshole  edit  thank you all so much for all your advice  i actually had the conversation with my roommate  believe it or not  she initiated it  im so proud of her because thats actually really scary for her and that took a lot of bravery  she told me she didnt like feeling so alone and that she wanted to spend more time with me  i affirmed her feels like a lot of you suggested  then told her what worked for me  were gonna cook a meal together and spend other quality time with each other every day  and ill start leaving my door open when im open to socializing  we found something that works for both of us and ended with a hug  it was great  thanks a lot   for people who have something to say about my boundaries   https   www reddit com r codependency comments fw  kt check yourself do you respect someone elses no    stop attaching meaning to other people s  no s  in general  they don t need a reason just like you don t need a reason to say no  to sharing something  doing something  etc  do not attach meaning behind someone s  no  that they themselves did not share with you   ex  they don t want to watch the show with me because they dont like me  don t want to spend time with me   maybe they are tired  maybe you don t know what happened in the rest of their day  maybe you aren t an all knowing creature who can assign meaning to other people s thoughts and actions  maybe  just maybe  they flat out just didn t feel like it  sometimes you have just felt like not doing something  right   stop grabbing ahold of someone s  no  and taking it onto yourself    attaching meaning  taking it personally   envision their little  no  as something that came from them and floated out into the air when they said it  why are you walking up and grabbing it out the air  to carry  it was not yours in the first place and it wasn t something that needed to be repossessed    it served its purpose  it conveyed a message  so let it float on by          that sounds really catty but that s how annoying it feels for me   basically  before the quarantine  we barely talked  maybe       mins a day  just the way our schedules line up  that s how it was  also in general  i really prefer to spend time alone  not in an introvert way there s just shit i like to do solo  i like to stop and start things when i want to without compromise  and i never ever ever in my life have ever been the kind of person who will spend a shit ton of time with one person  i have never been in this situation before  and i don t know how to say  i would like to be able to walk past you without you trying to turn it into an interaction    she wants to talk all the time  we can t pass by each other in the hallway without her trying to socialize  i can t just walk into the kitchen and eat something if she s in there  she keeps knocking on my door to tell me shit  even after i ve said i want some solo time  she wants to do things together and sometimes i do  too  but it s like her capacity to hang out never ends   here s the thing  i  do  leave when i want  i announce specifically that i m going to spend some time alone   and i don t carry on conversation if i don t want to  to the point where i ll sit in silence and wait for her to finish  and literally not say anything in reply   but she ll do things like follow me somewhere after i leave to add to a conversation that ended before i said i d leave  or keep talking even if i don t fucking reply   she seems to take it personally as well  i wanna nip that shit in the bud  not only because she s my roommate  it would really fucking suck if she took my need for space that has nothing to do with her personally and then i end up with a shitty passive aggressive roommate  but also because i have some compassion  i know  i can t control if she decides to take it personally  but i also know that saying things tactfully can really help the other person process a request  and i don t want this to like  press any of her insecurities if i can help it   what do you think  how do i tell my roommate not simply that i want space  but straight up i would like for her to initiate interaction less  to stop the conversation when i say i m leaving  and to stop knocking on my fucking door  ,0
i got some really good advice from my therapist that i want to share  advice for lonely people that have friends  i never considered my self as someone that had social problems  i talked to a bunch of people at school i m   m by the way  but over the years i constantly had this empty feeling of loneliness  even though i talked with a lot of people i didn t really hang out with any of them outside of school  i never really understood this  at my school i can be considered the big guy with no feelings and i never considered that that would shy people away  i mean i play football and i am commonly liked  one day this feeling of loneliness just took over  i had a therapist that i rarely see and that was usually only because my mother made me  but this was the first time my first thought was ask for a meeting with my therapist  i have had a therapist for probably about   or   years  anger issues  anxiety  ect   but not once have i ever asked to go to one  so of course when i asked my mom to schedule one she freaked out  i d also like to point out that i like my therapist a lot  he is a really cool guy and even though i haven t seen him in maybe   months i could easily talk with him  back to me being a dumb jock and shit  i m not one to cry like ever  but one day i just started bawling  i explained to him my loneliness and stuff and he knew the type of person i was  the first thing he said to me was i was acting like everything was ok to other people  the best way people connect with each other is with emotion and i was walking around high school like everything was perfect  let me tell yah it fuckin isn t   this allowed for people to like me but no one to genuinely connect with me  he wanted me to find someone i can share my feelings with and that would help me  finally he said when we share something that can hard to share for some people  others appreciate it and will confide in you and will strengthen your relationship  so my final statement for any emotionless jocks  or any others that have many aquintences but few friends  share your emotions  it won t scare people away like you think but it will bring them closer to you  some won t like you expressing your feelings and that s why you won t be friends with everyone  the people who connect with you after sharing your feelings are the real ones   i typed this on my phone at       so if it s bad sorry thank you all     edit  while i believe this advice can help me i am struggling to apply to my life  if you guys have any tips on how to express your feelings better to other people i m all ears  ,0

i m a mom at    with no family or friends this is actually my first time every posting to reddit  but i feel like it s a safe space to find support in a time where i really need it  i m     and have a    month old daughter  i m  lucky  enough to be a stay at home mom  but my relationship with my significant other is quite brutal at the moment  i have no friends whatsoever  not even someone to text on a bad day  i have no ability to get a job due to my significant other being an on the road truck driver and being gone for long periods of time  it s basically just me and her  i ve been in a deep depression now for most of her life  and i m trying to kick my own ass to get out of it  i don t want to feel like this forever  so basically  if you were me  where would you start  i m not in my home town anymore  and mind you  having a kid is a      job for me  so she s with me no matter what  i want to reach out  i want to build relationships and do things for me and be happy again  i just have no idea where to start or what that looks like anymore  i haven t had a friendship in years  so talking to people is terrifying  i would really love some advice or positive reinforcement at this point  i don t know if anyone is going to see this but i m just trying to shoot my shot  so thanks either way  ,0

i highly recommend watching  changing your body language can make you more confident by amy cuddy  if you havent already i just saw the  best ted talk ever  https   www youtube com watch v ks  mh qhmc  and it made me feel amazing  it makes so much sense and it made me realize my body language isnt adapted to improve my social skills and my confidence overall  im looking forward to get better at this and see the results   the talk gave me the chills at        i could feel her enthusiasm so much  i was overwhelmed with joy  its    minutes long but absolutely worth it  i know im a bit late too  since its from      and it already has    million views  but im hoping someone who hasnt already watched it can get a bit of motivation as well   there was also a lot of controversy regarding her study  since at first her method was too weak to scientifically prove it  she was told to be a junk scientist until she managed to  refute the criticism  https   www forbes com sites kimelsesser            power posing is back amy cuddy successfully refutes criticism   b  dc f b e   it made me believe again  ,0

stop being nice   many people act nice for the sole purpose of pleasing others and attempting to make themselves feel validated  i noticed that i have this issue and it has impacted me badly so i have made an ongoing commitment to deal with it  when you are a people pleaser  you are being ingenuine and dishonest  this shit makes things awkward and you become very boring because you constantly agree with what others are saying and doing and don t speak your mind for the simple fear of offending them  by being nice you make people see less value in you and make yourself become more vulnerable to being exploited by others   you have to realise that you just can t please everyone  you never ever will be able to  and it s completely okay  its how the world works  i ve been nice for so long and it has done fuck all for me  for as long as you re a people pleaser  you will be stuck inside your own mind and shell and you will continue to have negative thoughts and sometimes even anxiety  the key is just not to give a fuck what others think  you do things the way you do and stop seeking validation  and i know it s so much easier said than done but you have to realise that others don t care much about what you do  to put it more simply  the world doesn t give a fuck about you  you re just like anyone else  you re not special  it s facts  so why then  should you worry so much  think back to your daily lives  how much do you notice and care about what others do  exactly  not much  that s precisely how others view you as well  people focus on themselves too much to care about what others are doing  realise this and you won t be as anxious   nice people tend to put others ahead of themselves and constantly seek the approval of others  this is honestly such a damaging trait to have  now don t get me wrong  there is a distinct contrast between being  nice  and being  kind   the difference between the two is that when you re kind  you are being genuine with your intentions and do it because you want to  whereas when you re nice  you do it ingeuinely and are dishonest to yourself and others because you want to please the other person and get them to like validate you   so many people are nice for the wrong reasons  start changing from this moment onwards  be your true self  don t be dishonest  stop seeking validation  build your self confidence and do shit with honest intentions   do it because you want to  not because you think it ll make someone like you   don t seek happiness from others  start to take control of your lives and do not let others control it for you  the truth is no one gives a fuck about you as harsh as it may seem  this is just how the world works  i promise that when you stop being nice  that doesn t mean the same as stop being kind  that you will live a tremendously better life  also  remember that to stop being nice that doesn t that you should just become a massive jerk  sure  you will without a doubt offend people because you can t please everyone  but don t transition into a dickhead where you put constantly put others down for the wrong reasons because it makes you feel better  i think the more appropriate way to deal with this is to be  assertive  when you need to  whereas a nice person would just let themselves be taken advantage of because they don t want to cause conflict    realise that you will offend people  you will come across people who don t like you  you will never ever be able to please everybody  but don t let it stop you from doing what you want just because others don t like it  don t be a people pleaser because the world and society doesn t reward people pleasers  just stop giving a fuck what others think about you and don t obtain your happiness by seeking validation from others because if this is the way you gain happiness  then you will never ever truly be happy  stop being that fake  agreeable and boring nice person and you will gain massive respect along the way and you will build stronger relationships with others  there s no better time to start doing this other than right now   i just felt like i had to get this out there  i myself have been a victim for far too long and it s diminished my social status and impacted my social skills  i truly hope this helps many of you guys out there  even if it s just one person i ll be happy that i have made a positive impact on that person s life  best of luck  ,0
the secret of talking to girls there is no secret  they are people too  talk  to them the same way you would with guys  no need to be perfect  weigh every word  try to impress etc  fuck that  as with everyone else  just be you and who is going to like you will like you and vice versa   edit  some people have pointed out that you cant talk about same topics with them  true to some extent  i didnt mean it that way per se  i meant the way you talk to them  ,0
finally confessed to my years long crush and got rejected  yay  i was coward  i couldnt make a move  worrying about the consequences and the possibilities  but finally gathered enough courage after saying to this myself     we are space monkeys livin in a blue green planet  things would be dust eventually  so  nothing really matters     called her after a while said about my feelings and got no response whatsoever  but it felt really good to do something ive been scared to do the past two years   edit  thank you fellow redditors  just clarified and she said she had no interest on me   edit   thanks for all those insights  appreciation  and jokes  loved em    if theres anything you take away from this post  do what scares you or what you feel is little outside your comfort zone  already doing it  youre a daredevil    ,0
i realized that the reason why i felt many people distant and cold was because i was the distant and cold one i just realized it after crossing ways with a person that when we first met tried to start a conversation and so on and i didnt react at all after that  ive encountered her a couple of times and every time i looked at her hoping that shell start a conversation but she didnt and it made me realize that i always unconciously expect people to be nice and interact  with me while i dont show interest im  working on changing this   starting by smiling when meeting people or at least having a welcoming face will sure be a good beginning  ,0
an epilogue  my first date   i did it  and it was amazing  so i    m  post on this sub a few weeks ago that id asked a girl out and was going on a date    well  heres what happened   i waited at the coffee shop where we said we were going to meet  and she never showed up  heeluva first date huh    but thats not where this story ends   i met someone else  on tinder   we chatted for a bit  and eventually i asked for her number  we texted back and forth for the next couple of days  and i finally got up the nerve to ask if she wanted to hang out sometime   this girl was attractive  and honestly slightly out of my league   so this morning  i met up with her for coffee  i was so unbelievably nervous that i dont think i got much sleep last night    i didnt expect to be there for more than    minutes  i thought about how i was supposed to greet her  what i would do if she didnt like me  what i would if there were awkward silences  etc   i talked to this girl for   hours       wonderful  hours    im pretty sure its the single longest conversation ive had with someone    she texted me afterwords and said she had a wonderful time  and wants to hang out again    so today  i kinda had a life changing experience  i still have a lot of work to do  but now i know im capable of having the ability to make someone like me    i know this post is mostly just me bragging  but i had a really great day today  the best one ive had in a while  and really wanted to tell someone about it  ,0
a girl said hi to me    i was walking shirtless on the beach with my parents and my cousin who is male  while i was walking i was starring at my phone and i remember i was smiling because i saw something funny  then i hear a girl saying hi i turn back and see a group of girls  i didnt think she was talking to me so i continue walking but then she says hi again and i turn back she was waving and looking at me and i said hi back to her  then i get my cousin and went to meet them we introduced ourselves and asked their names  then i asked where are they from and they told me that they are from serbia and i realized that i can partly understand their language because im macedonian so i started speaking serbian  they asked us where are we from we told them skopje  i could understand what they were saying but they couldnt understand me when i was speaking serbian  so i was speaking partly english  then they asked us if we want to play volleyball with them  we said sure why not  i sucked at volleyball  but the others werent any better  it was fun  i shouldve asked them what are they doing later tonight and for the girls number and insta but whatever i learned my lesson  be confident dont be afraid to talk    sorry if i have typos or bad english  ,0
why cant i get friends   answered    why i couldnt at the time  so about a year ago i made a post  seeking help on this subreddit  i decided to ask if anyone knew what was going on whith me  why i couldnt get help  i didnt really get any solid answers  but a short while after that i decided that it was time to make a drastic change  after reading many books  changing my lifestyle  and my understanding of social relations i finally figured out what i was lacking at the time  and why i couldnt see it  a year from that low point  i have a solid group of friends  enjoy talking to people  and i even got a girlfriend  and let me tell you  learning all of this has been at times quite a painful experience  my original post is in  italics   and i broke it down into sections  addressing each point individually     here i am answering my own question in retrospective  hoping that it might help some of you who are experiencing the same issues  or who have experienced them in the past without understanding why they happened     x   b    hi  im writing this to see if anyone might know wtf is going on or is also experiencing the same problem  im in my junior year of high school currently  i am good at most things  i play the guitar and sing passably well  i write pretty songs and cool short stories  i played varsity soccer for three years  i am also pretty attractive physically  and im not so bad at social interactions    yes  i did all of these things  pretty developed individual  the only problem was that i was doing all of them because i wanted people to like me  all of these behaviors came from a place of neediness    initially  people are usually impressed with me  girls like me when its the first time they see me  guys see me as a really cool person  etc  then as the days pass its like my social value drops from top to bottom in any type of group situation i am  this has been true in every single group or social place i have joined my entire life  no one ever texts me first  or invites me somewhere  it always has to be me    the problem here was that the guy that people were usually impressed with   that wasnt me  whenever i was introduced to new people  i began performing  i said just enough to give them the impression of being a total stud  hoping they would like me  i let a cascade of little white lies drip from my mouth  upselling my value  but when i wasnt just meeting people for one night  my act began to break down  slowly at first  then more dramatically  when circumstances made me show my true colors  people realized that i had been dishonest in my first impression  this lack of honesty was the big blow that made the girls fly  and that cemented my place at the bottom of social hierarchy after a few days  once youre there  you have to constantly persuade people to hang out with you     x   b    i have literally tried everything  i read three books on social skills and even that one about the     laws of power   i tried being nice to everyone  being selectively nice  i tried the  being real  thing for more than a year without trying to alter my natural behavior  didnt work either  i know i suffer from anxiety  so i started taking this drug called phenibut  it worked wonders and my anxiety disappeared  but still no friends  i took adderall for a while too  and it only made things worse    pride is a wonderful thing by  everything  i meant two things  books written by fraudulent online bloggers  and drugs  you cant blame a drug for your behavior  and you cant change it with a drug either  without changing its core  even without anxiety  my dishonesty and neediness was still present in my behavior  when i said i tried   being real   it was a lie  i didnt stop lying  and i was just looking for a redditor that told me a miraculous remedy in which i didnt have to put the work in to discover and dissect my core issues    i have moved school twice  i spent a year in boarding school  and initially everyone wanted to be my friend  i tried being real nice that time  and at first it really worked  but eventually even my friends started treating me like i was an annoying awkward frog looking weirdo  this year i switched schools again  at first it was there too  everyone thought i was really nice  really cool and confident  i was invited to an exclusive gathering and even became part of a group of friends for a week  this time i tried to have a mean outlook but to be nice to my friends  a short time later two guys wanted to beat the shit otta me  one of them actually did it too  a month or so later  soon my old  best friends  were looking for ways to avoid me    again  the performance exposure rejection dynamic  in two different examples  doesnt matter what the performance is  as long as its a performance with the aim of getting people to like you  itll have the contrary effect  be honest about your flaws  thoughts  opinions  and feelings  even if you think itll make people reject you further  i can almost guarantee you that it wont  and if it does  at least you know those people arent meant for the real you  and that you are a wholesome individual     x   b    phenibut helps but it doesnt solve the root problem and i cant take it more than   times a week  i have gone deep into self improvement  i work out  meditate  have honor roll grades and go to any social events i can  where i often talk to a bunch of people  yet all the people i say are my  friends  dont consider me part of their inner groups and they usually treat me like im some annoying thing to run away from  even when i am being actually funny or just nice  or friendly  and always talkative  or quiet  no matter what i do  i cant seem to make people like me    again  whining about what a cool little toddler i am  and nobody likes me  a mature individual accepts his responsibility for his own failures instead of bragging to a bunch of redditors about how awesome he is and complaining about how everybody else is to blame  you have to take responsibility for your own failures  and not be an egomaniac who blames them on others   it doesnt matter who you are if youre not honest with yourself about it  thats even more important than being honest with others  and a necessary first step in personal growth  sit down  breathe  feel the emotions in your chest  the tightness  ask yourself  where does it come from  try to be fully honest with yourself  without judging  just understanding  is it really everyone elses fault  is there really nothing you can change    i even stopped trying completely for a year  didnt work  honestly at this point i am emotionally healthy by myself  i recognize that friends arent necessary for happiness and i am quite satisfied with my accomplishments  but i am really curious to know why does this phenomenon happen  and if others have experienced it too    denial is just another form of self deceit  if you want to have friends  the worst thing you can do is telling yourself that you dont need them and avoiding people to avoid the negative emotions that come with the failure they represent  fear  anxiety  shame   dont  face them head on  face your issues and grow  this  phenomenon  happens because of a baseline insecurity that has to be compensated for with performances and lies both to others and to oneself  stop blaming society for rejecting you and take responsibility  stop hiding your true selves behind lackluster performances and petty lies  be  true  to yourselves  most of all   i am happy i could share what i learned in my own path with you  let me know if you have any questions  i am here to help  i also have a lot to learn still  so feel free to comment if you have additional opinions or suggestions  much love  and good luck to all of you on your own journeys of personal development  thanks for reading     edit   wow  im so happy this is being read by so many people  thanks for the support  several people asked about what i actually did to make a real change in my life  this was obviously the most difficult part of the process  and i dont think i will ever get it       after i began noticing these mayor flaws in my social behavior  and became aware of what was wrong  i set up the following personal commitments     x   b      telling the truth  i dont just mean dont make up petty lies  but share your particular truth  if you feel anxious or sad or did something stupid  share that with people  if you dont agree with someones opinon  tell them  recognize your failures to others  dont complain  just share  and your successes too  dont brag      understand your personal states  this one was tricky  do not suppress emotions  or try to rationalize you way out of them  just feel them  ponder them  label them  im sad  angry  etc  and trace them to their source  because of this and that   then accept them     live in action  not mind  once youve implemented commitment    and have accepted your emotional states  its time to go out into the world with them  do not use your emotions as an excuse to avoid actions  you feel anxious about your speech  good  now go do it  youre sad because your girl dumped you and feel like bailing on that big party  good cause thatll make it a bigger gesture when you show up  afraid to climb that big hill  good  cause itll take more courage to do it  if you need to do something or want to  do it regardless of your mind  action is king     take responsability for your failures  blaming others for your failures doesnt help you learn from them  this one is related to     but its more about yourself  youre bad at a sport  its not because of who youre playing with  or the weather  or your shoes  its you  practice more  the entire school hates you  probably not the entire schools fault  its narcissistic to assume that the entire universe its conspiring against you rather than accepting your own responsibility for your failures and success  read mark manson  he talks a lot about this      dont be afraid of failure  failing is good  you hear what im saying  failing is good  but only if you fail by trying to do something  if you dont fail because you didnt try  thats much worse than giving it your best shot and failing  especially if you can learn from that failure  i made a bet with myself to get rejected by     girls in six months  i lost count eventually but the spirit of the idea stayed  and guess what  i approached   girls every night  and shared things i wouldnt want to share with someone i was afraid would reject me  and sure enough  i got rejected plenty of times  but i also experienced more success than ever before  because i wasnt afraid to fail  try the same for different fields of achievement  youll see what happens   i made these five commitments with myself  and have gradually implemented them into my life  i also tried a bunch of other things  but these were the basics  try them  and see the results for yourself

try talking to people as if theyre already your friend  i think its a lot easier to become socially comfortable with people when you treat them as if youre already cool with them  you wont be under as much pressure and it will be easier to have a smooth conversation  when you meet new people  it may take some time before you can actually consider them your friend but if you change your mindset and talk to new people as if youve know them for a long time  youll be able to connect a lot quicker   ,0

to the guys who are afraid of talking to girls    hello  so i have been reading many stories on this subreddit about guys having a hard time talking to girls or trying to initiate or maintain a conversation with them  i totally understand that it can feel like the end of the world trying to speak to another human being  i know it s outrageous     to really help you guys with this problem   i ll just start out by outlining some common traits that anxious guys have around attractive girls     having  fake  confidence around attractive girls  this means trying to impress her and not being yourself     putting attractive girls on a  pedestal  and having a rating system  score of          being very attractive     being afraid of rejections  this is a big one      seeking validation and feeling needy  ok out of the four traits  i want you to pick one that you re struggling the most and write it down    times  now  starting from today  you re going to put yourself out there and what i really mean is you being vulnerable    important note  try to persuade yourself that girls are also humans and they shit just like us and their shit smell just as bad    these are the things i want you to keep in mind when you re out there talking to girls     girls can sense insecurities a mile away     when in doubt  think of your intention  you stutter less when you have intention       rejection is part of filtering the girls that aren t compatible with you    there s literally billions of things you can talk about and being anxious will limit what you can say    i m going to bed but if this post gets traction  i will continue it        ,0
lpt  it sounds counter intuitive  but focus on yourself to make friends  when you re passionate about your hobbies you ll meet people easily  hiking club  car meets  video game clubs  the gym  etc  single point of interest things like these are better than the bar where everyone is super different   ,0
has anybody else felt like sometimes youre very charismatic and other times youre just trying too hard and arent engaging  ive definitely gotten out of my shell quite a bit these past few months  but i suppose ill always be an introvert at heart  ive taken more to the whole  fake it till you make it  kind of mindset  most of the time ill just bring up random topics to make conversation  and sometimes it feels like it works well  and im very captivating  and other times i feel just the opposite  im not sure if this in my head or what  and i am working really hard to ease my mind  as i have done so well in the past  i think a big part of it is comparing what im doing now to what i was doing say a week or maybe a month ago  like if the conversations im having now arent how they were i get flustered and in my head  im not really asking for advice  more of just a vent  i think being really tired and stressed is also coming into play here  as well as finding it increasingly difficult to be happy for some reason  i just feel different somehow then i did in previous months  and im not sure what to make of it  ,0

anyone feel like you re never anyone s first choice  i get along pretty well with people around me  i don t have many close friends but people approach me and talk to me enough that i know i m well liked  i don t mind having not really any of out of school  work buddies and to be honest i like to spend me free time with myself    but  the one thing that does get to me is that it seems that while i might be part of a group or people consider me a friend  i m never a person of interest for others  no one ever seems eager to keep me around or pursue me further  in a group of three i m the third wheel  last one picked for kickball kind of thing    for example i was spending time with some people this weekend and we were all having fun and i noticed a couple others exchanging snapchats and phone numbers but no one ever asked me  no one leans over and takes a silly selfie with me  suddenly i felt like an outsider  the least interesting out of all of them   leaving the closing shift i walk out with my work friends and i say bye to them  thinking we all go our separate ways  and then i turn around and see them grouped up in the parking lot corner  without me  frequently    i figured that my closer coworkers who are in my department don t hang out outside of work because no one ever asks me  but then one will offhandedly mention  oh yeah when i was getting lunch with so and so the other day     and i realize that they do hang out  just not with me  even those who i thought i was better friends with than others   i can t tell if i just seem unapproachable or what  i m always getting comments about how people appreciate my friendliness  how i m fun to be around  all these words that boost my ego  but then the real deal comes around and i feel like i m not actually a person that someone would think they want to spend time with    the one flaw i see in this is that i don t really initiate hanging out either  but that s because it s kind of a two way street when i get the feeling that no one wants to spend time with me  how can i battle that anxiety of rejection  especially when it seems inevitable  it s an incredibly weird lonely feeling  especially since im not alone  just like  silent unprovoked rejection     let me know if there is a more proper sub for this  edit  formatting edit    probably worth mentioning i have pretty bad social anxiety  like the i m going to barf if i have to hang out with someone alone with no context or no forced situation lol  it sucks when what you want is also what makes you feel awful ,0
  ways i got better at talking   without leaving my house      free association      every morning  instead of going straight to the toilet to take a huge piss  i pull out the camera on my phone and record myself talking for    minutes straight in stream of consciousness  this is my version of daily journaling  for    minutes i talk about anything that comes to my mind without stopping  even if it makes no sense  and most of the time it doesnt  after doing this for a week  i immediately noticed results  i can now speak with less of a filter  no filler words  and i dont have to think of what to say next especially if i want to talk to a cute girl       narration      a lot of the books i have on my bookshelf have been collecting dust  i had to give them some love  ive been picking up a book and reading it out loud as if im narrating an audiobook  its a different process than reading in silence because my voice  a physical instrument  was being used  my vocal apparatus was being exercised as a muscle and i was getting used to what it would be like to speak constantly and cohesively  the gift of the gab       chat rooms     i started going to a free online chat website that allows users to socialize with others through a webcam  ill be honest  i saw of a lot of dicks and weird stuff  aside from that  chat rooms like omegle are a great simulation for meeting a stranger in real life  i got to work on being able to hold a conversation  my listening skills  leading a conversation  and being able to banter with humor   and there you have it    easy things you can implement right now to get better at talking  if you have any questions i am more than happy to answer them  ,0

i asked a girl out that im attracted to and she said yes    ive been a lurker of this sub for only a short while  but i really respect everyone here and everything you guys have accomplished  im here to share a story about the first girl ive ever asked out  so shes been coming into our store for a good minute and she and i always just had good vibes  we would always just talk casually and she is just drop dead gorgeous  but what i love even more about her is her personality  she is always happy  smiling  super bubbly and just a super cool person in general  for the past week i told myself i was going to ask her out and finally today she came in  i helped her find what she was looking for and when i felt the time was right i asked if she was single  then when she said yes i asked her out on a date and she said yes with a smile    so i gave her my number    this is the first time i have ever asked a girl out i was interested in  in the past ive always been too scared  but today i changed that and i feel like a million bucks  ,0

today  i went out and bought shoes without having to ask my parents to talk for me  note  on mobile    anxiety and years of self isolation is shitty cause i couldnt find people that would hang out me without having to feel like i have to change my masks every second of everyday  plus  i was the eldest in our street so     the innate ability to see and understand social cues does not exist for me so this is definitely progress  for the first time  i didnt talk     mph nor mumbled my words  ,0
i asked a girl out today hey guys  i m a long time lurker first time poster in this sub i asked a girl out today she works next door to my work and i asked her out for a coffee  i got turned down but i m super proud that i asked  i just wanted to share that so thanks for reading  edit  sorry for the shitty formatting ,0
i am having    people over at my place tomorrow    i know thats not a big thing for many people  but i dont have someone over very often  since i only have like   friends   but some weeks ago  i found the courage to ask my collegues from my weekly meditation group if they wanted to watch a movie at my place  i have joined the group one year ago and they never meet up apart from the course  at least not as far as i know   but i just decided to give it a try  i was shaking inside and probably outside as well because of my social anxiety  but i did it  because i like them a lot   and nearly everyone want to come  some were even so excited  that they immidiately started discussing the movie  who brings the snacks etc    i guess they all wanted to spend more time together  but nobody made the first step so far    so if you are in a similar situation  dont be afraid to make the first step  maybe thats the step the others have been waiting for all the time  good luck     edit  thanks for the platinum     since many of you asked for it  i will later give you an update on how it went   edit     i had the best time ever today  we were    people in my tiny flat and it was soo much fun  i asked everyone to bring something they like to eat or drink  and they brought so much food we had a buffett with bread  spreads  homemade cookies  chips  popcorn etc  we all took some food and then sat down in my living room to watch the film  and it was quite crowded  but since we all know eachother that was pretty funny   some were making funny comments during the movie and everyone was laughing and i felt soo damn happy  like really at home with them  it was just great  they stayed also some time after the movie to discuss it and talk to eachother  and afterwards everybody thanked me for the great evening and they all seemed so happy the whole time   what i learned     having a nice playlist is a key   having small games also helps  we have a small basketball hoop plus small basketballs and everyone loved it    having so many people in a small flat is just fun  at least for me    being a host is easier then being a guest  because when you need a break  you always have something to do and can just get the plates or drinks    and everyone will think you are a great host   ask the guests to bring food  you can talk about that too  like recipe for the cookies  and have less to worry about   thank you everyone here for your tips and for caring about my story and wishing me luck  definitely worked out    you are all breathtaking    ,0
hi  im an anthropologist who is focused on friendships  heres a few tips  some of you might be familiar with something called dunbars number  which says you can have about     friends  it was originally found by dunbar by looking at clans of monkeys and at what size they split into two clans again  then looking at their brain sizes and found a correlation and then theorized that humans would have about     relationships  its basically been proven by looking at the average amount of friends on facebook and by asking ceos at what point  they dont remember all the names of all their employees  which starts at about     employees   that was the beginning but what about  real  friends  its often said that the most incredible thing about jesus was that he had    close friends at the age of      not only do we see that teenagers have the most friends  and there is a couple of theories  not only are we as teenagers extremely focused on others  to the extent  that it is the group that buys the most expensive things compared to their income  were also trying to socialize to gain identity and become socially aware  a co creation of identity  with and through everyone around us   but what about me  how many friends should i have     x   b     the tips     just like there is a smooth curve for how many friends each individual have  there is also a curve for how important these friends are  but as a rule of thumb       survival friends close friends is needed for survival  this includes family      friends you told your deepest fears  issues  embarrassments and such  we as social creators need people we can trust  and making the effort helps your mental health  your social health  improves your mental health        close friends  these are the people youd invite to your family birthday  in some cultures they are separated and its not to say that all your family is in your top     but that you should be aware of  who is really in your close network          support friends  people come in and out of all these  circles  and are most likely in your top    if you go abroad as an example  you all feel so close  because you are all in your top     its to say that your top    can change quite quickly and that it is perfectly fine  these are the people who support you in your current environment and should be supported back as well for obvious reasons  its great to have them around  but it might also answer why they arent all around when you suddenly move  its not in bad faith  human brains and our capacity for close relationships are just not able to handle more relationships           acquaintance  you might nod at them in the supermarket  and they might be up for a rare social encounter  they might be your neighbor  they might suddenly become a close friend  in many ways  its remarkable how quickly we change status         the increase in loneliness        there are many reasons for everything  economic  environmental and social  but another is technological   back in the day  when people couldnt travel and connect on almost infinite distance  we were sort of bound to find the  best  of those around  and to be fair  one could be unlucky not to find anyone  thats not the case today and it creates two challenges  you or others always have other options   you or others can hold on to friendships without real value       i have     facebook friends but a feel lonely  what am i doing wrong     the problem is that you probably made up for your loneliness by adding more friends  rather than deeper friendships  how vulnerable have you been with your friends  focus on top          i dont have any friends and i am afraid of putting too much effort into the friendship  for then having them ghost me     activities are a great way to bond  but you should try to notice  what are my limitations and be aware that others put up as evenly arbitrary limitations on themselves  you want to go for a walk  they dont want to sweat  and then there is timing  especially in relation to others focus on problem   and    you might need to keep practicing on your top      eventually youll have failed enough to learn to craft while hitting the timing to reach better relationships   which is to say  friendships are harder and take more of an effort than people might know  but the key important part here is that one can practice  either to be more vulnerable or to be more aware of others vulnerabilities in a caring way   on a side note hopefully this summer  ill have an app that helps on practice better friendships   keep practicing and feel free to ask me about anything     x   b   best regards                                           just to make it clear  its perfectly fine having    survival  person    people you would invite to your birthday     people you talk to in your everyday life     people you know  what matters is that you have a network of different types of friends to feel socially fulfilled                                           one last thing  if you feel perfectly fine without friends  no worries  the assumption is that humans are social creatures and were asked about friends  no one asked said they didnt want any friends  and that it  can  have an impact on peoples mental health                                        i removed the part about suicide as i didnt do a good enough job explaining it  but the short hand is that there can be a correlation between social health and mental health  i originally wrote it as feedback to another post on the this sub  ,0

i wish we could share exactly how we feel with people  instead we all have to use our words  bleh my friend texted me about something rather mundane but which i appreciated he felt comfortable talking to me about and which i was interested in hearing him say  but i didn t know how to respond to it over text  it was something that  in a normal in person conversation  would ve warranted a smile or a nod of the head or a thoughtful  hmm   so i just replied  wow icic that s cool  or something like that  which felt rather shallow and insincere despite the fact that i really did appreciate him sharing that with me  and i asked some vaguely related question  yeah  i get anxious about texting sometimes  it feels like maybe it s gotten worse over quarantine  or maybe it s just this person  it s hard to tell  i really enjoyed talking to him and i wanted to share that sentiment but it seemed strange to do so with typed out words  or even spoken words though spoken words are rather irrelevant as we were texting not calling  at that moment  i wished that we could share our feelings with people via telepathy or something crazy like that   i value what you say and i m glad you said that  is what i want to let him know  but it s too formal when i put it into concrete words and because i know that what he said was so ordinary   i m listening even if i don t have a reply  i want to say  but those words don t fit quite right in our casual conversation either and i don t even know that i want to say that until the next day  maybe it s on him  he seems to have forgotten to send the figurative conversation tennis ball back to my side of the court this time and so  because that would be technically his fault and not mine  i shouldn t stress too much about it and should just reply however i like  but i do stress anyway and texting is hard when communication is already hard and when texting takes away inflection and facial expression and body language and the ability to let the person next to you know that you re listening and not ignoring them even if you don t really verbally respond  i do appreciate texting and all  it s pretty cool when you stop to think about it  but it d be so cool and so hecking helpful to just be able to send someone the experience of what you re feeling  the actual feeling  not just your best words for it  the sentiment behind what you say  unhindered by the imperfections of the english language  it s limitations  or the countless possible interpretations that can be drawn from the same sentence  they d just know  they d feel it and get it  but it s wishful thinking and i know that  too  i guess i just needed to get that out  i ll keep trying to improve at normal conversation and communication    oh  and i don t text with the tone or style that i ve written this post in  sometimes when i end up writing longer things my style goes into this sort of semi poetic thing and i just go with it  it lets me say what i want to  anyway  thank you for listening to me  i ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you really did listen even though i can t be sure over text   hope you have a day that maybe isn t the most absolutely wonderful  but that nonetheless is good and serene  ,0
anyone else dislike it when people say  youre so quiet    or something similar  ive frequently gotten  youre so quiet  or some variation on that throughout my life  i dont understand how people even  expect me to respond to that    haha yeah    this is so not how i want to be perceived  and i of course know that im quiet  and i really dont want to be  anxiety sucks   someone pointing out to me that im quiet is not at all the kind of thing thats going to help me get over that  if anything it makes me more uncomfortable   ive also gotten comments on my height a lot  as a slightly tall woman   which doesnt bug me as much  but its the same sort of thing  i know i am  and i think its safe to assume im not elated to be tall  so why bring it up   this is all not to say that these things really bother me  i guess i just dont understand the conversational drive here  i would never think to say something like this to someone  anyone have thoughts similar experiences agree or disagree that this type of comment is slightly strange  ,0

none of my friends showed up to my party  even though they said they were coming  my roommates    m     m     m     m  and i    f  threw a party last weekend  and none of my friends showed up  the party was oscar themed and guests were encouraged to dress up  we planned the party a month ahead of time and i bought decorations  food  and alcohol in preparation  i spent the entire day cleaning and decorating for the party the day of    i had invited all my friends from work  as well as friends from college  i sent the invites out weeks ahead of time  with reminders as it got closer  it was around    people total  i also encouraged them to bring friends or significant others  at least    confirmed on the fb invite  and a few told me they were coming and possibly bringing their friends  based on that information  i told my roommates that i had at least      friends coming    an hour into the party  most of my roommate s friends had arrived  around    people  but i hadn t heard from any of mine  i decided to wait a little longer  and then waited for the next   hours hoping they were just showing up late  i tried to enjoy the party  and mingled with my roommates friends  but by midnight i realized none of my friends were going to show  i tried really  really hard not to think about it and enjoy my night  but after drinking a few beers i found myself holding back tears    they received reminders the day before and the day of the party  so i know they didn t miss any notifications  maybe i should have texted them during the party to ask where they were  but i felt too embarrassed    i thought my coworkers would say something to me about the party on monday  but no one said anything  i never received any messages either    i don t hang out with my friends consistently  but i see my coworkers at work and get lunch with them most days  a few of them have been to my house before  and i definitely considered them my friends    my confidence took a huge hit that night  and i feel so embarrassed about the whole thing  it s only been a few days since the party  but i m feeling incredibly low and i can t get over it  i find myself questioning everything about my life  are these people even my friends  am i not a likable person  why didn t they care enough to send a message or mention it on monday  what am i doing wrong    i ve thought about confronting them  but it would make me feel worse if they got uncomfortable  i also don t want them hanging out with me out of pity    tldr  i invited friends and coworkers to a party with plenty of notice and reminders  but no one showed up even after telling me they were coming  i feel embarrassed and sad and i can t figure out why no one came    update  i m at work today and slowly reading through all the comments  your responses have lifted me  thank you for all the support  i m taking the time to reflect on myself and then i ll start working towards forming new and genuine relationships   my friends might not have shown up that night  but i m blown away by all the advice and understanding i ve received from strangers on the internet  if anyone has tips on how to start forming meaningful friendships  i d love to hear your thoughts    update     things i ve learned since posting this       coworkers are not friends  as much as i d like this to be false  this was a pretty consistent theme throughout the comments      an oscar themed party does not sound fun to a lot of people  i love parties with themes  but i read dozens of comments from people stating that they would not have attended such an elaborate party  for those asking  the party was held on a saturday      i should have been more aware of my relationship with these people in the first place  i assumed we were friends without fully considering how they might feel about me       the internet can be a really kind place in the right setting  i appreciate every comment and i m in the process of reading all of them       they re still assholes for telling me they were coming and then not showing up  dozens of commenters said they ve experienced this as well    i did ask a few of my coworkers how their weekends were  without bringing up the party directly  i got the responses i was expecting  many along the lines of   oh yeah sorry about the party by the way  i got off work and was way too tired to go    sorry  it was my best friends birthday that night   ,0

anyone else feel like theyre always interrupting  whenever i watch others talk in group conversations  the conversation seems to flow more or less smoothly   someone says something  then somebody else says something in response and so on  but when i try to jump in the conversation  it always seems like its at the exact moment when someone else is opening their mouth to say something too  and then it gets a little awkward  anyone else get that  whats up with that  ,0
people are so quick to suggest people to just abandon others  edit  of course if your in a actually abusive relationship you should leave  i mean people have problems with people  but never mention them to the other person  they only abandon the person before trying to solve the problem  yes relationships are a two way street  but there are ups and downs  and you should be willing to stick through the downs if you care for them   i see this all the time on reddit    parents are unfair  move out    friend is being weird or rude  block him on all social media    partner is acting differently  dump his arse   even people who are friends with those clearly struggling with mental health  or attachment issues  are told to just abandon them because  it is not ops fault   of course its not your fault  but you have a responsibility as a human being to help others  its called being a kind person  i think this whole movement is a bad and selfish path for society  its like if a relationship is not beneficial to you in some form  there is not need to keep it  to hell with other people  every relationship will run into problems  bu there is no need to scrap it completely    look this is not a hill im willing to die on  but i have dealt with abandonment myself and have been ghosted by people i thought were my friends  so it hurts to see this behavior been encouraged  and it reminds me of being on the other side  if you have a counter argument  id love to hear it  so long as you dont insult me beforehand  another thing redditors are too quick to do  all your doing is putting me on the defensive     tldr  people today are being encouraged to be too quick to abandon others  and have no regard for the feelings of others  just if the relationship benefits them personally  id like to hear counter arguments though  ,0
does anyone else keep their answers short because they think people will get bored if they talk too much  its a really weird thing that ive noticed i do a lot    well  pretty much all the time  it doesnt matter if im talking to my friends family strangers  im always finding a way to keep my responses short because i feel like if my answer is too long  the person will get bored and not want to listen to me anymore tune me out    for example   person   do you remember what that thing looked like    what i want to say   hmm  if i remember correctly  it was blue  but im really not sure    what i end up saying   blue  maybe    its not even like i tend to babble  i just like to talk but i get nervous they dont want to listen to me  does anyone else feel this way  or can anyone give me advice on why i should should not keep doing this  ,0

in case no one told you today don t ever forget that you are special and loved with that being said have a great week    ,0
if you don t treat yourself with love and respect your social life will be shit  i know this may not be the exact right place to say this but i still think it s really important when you go socialize with people that you love and respect yourself  if you don t love and respect yourself you fail to connect with people because you seek validation instead of trying to connect  when you socialize with people it s to see if you can connect with them or at least to see if you like them not to see if they re pleased with your presence   it s way easier to interact with people when you don t constantly have that pressure that you gotta act a certain way or say certain things so that people like you  you socialize because you want to   when you don t love or respect yourself you settle for less than you deserve you hang out with people you don t necessarily like or people that disrespect you  you re constantly afraid of being judged but don t realized that you re worst than what you re afraid of  when you re afraid to be judged it s because you judge yourself and others so it s all in your mind   how many friendships opportunity did i lost because i was too afraid to be myself or to connect with the other  ,0

last year i posted here in excitement about overcoming my anxiety and getting a cute guys number    today was our   year anniversary dating just an update i thought would be nice to share     it s good to stick a foot out the comfort zone every now and then and i learned that from this sub  i would have never thought i d get this far a year ago  thank you    edit  just woke up to all this positivity  and it s absolutely lovely  thanks everyone i really hope this inspires some of you to not give up  i love how wholesome this sub is each time i post love y all  ,0
   m  here are some tips ive learned to overcome some social anxiety  especially with the opposite sex     its not weird  just say it dont try to change it or say it in a better way and dont worry about the outcome     stop using your phone as a backup for awkward interactions  take a deep breath  think calmly  and say something     you dont always have to know everything or have the right answer  sometimes a simple  i dont know  is the best answer     try to be as honest as possible     focus on the person youre interacting with not the surroundings  dont care about what that guy behind you is gonna think of what you said to the person youre talking to     talking about the boring day you had is still better than an awkward silence     beware of your subconscious decisions  dont try to adapt to a certain expectation that you think the person youre interacting with has on you in order for them to like you  in other words  embrace your personality     if you find yourself extremely nervous in social situation and your mind tells you to take the safe route to comfort  you do the exact opposite  your mind is like your mom  it wants you to be safe at all times even if it comes at a loss     remember youre there to entertain yourself  not others   nothing wrong to be selfish      i wrote this one so the numbers can be even lol   edit  number    should ve been  embrace the awkwardness  ,0
maybe its not about  being more social   instead  what if its more about knowing yourself  and being social enough to meet your own needs i spent the past two years bettering myself and the past year obsessing over  becoming more social  and going out non stop and experimenting and telling myself that itd be a good way to get out of comfort zone  did i learn anything  sure  but not what youd expect     im coming to the realization that teaching someone or learning  how to be social  is super misguided    its like telling someone who is meant to be a pro chess player  im going to teach you how to be better at playing games   its so broad that most of it is useless and time consuming  no  you dont have to go out   times a week  no  you dont need a social circle to have friends  no  you dont need to be a group conversation god to get a business deal     you need to figure out how you process the world    introvert or extrovert  self esteem and confidence levels  codepence issues  narcissism  insecurities  boundary issues etc      how that affects your interactions with others    ex  being needy  trying too hard  being defensive etc     and then what you need out of interacting with others    ex  one on one close friendships for companionship  business deals  an acquaintance for work etc    all you can do is better yourself  whatever that end result is   know that this is the best that can come out of you  maybe your best isnt the picture perfect hollywood ideal of a social butterfly or suave socialite  maybe its not even side kick worthy  but you know what  theres no ninja mental gymnastic shit that will make you some genius social communicator with a mouth that flows honey  if youve somehow conquered all your insecurities  you speak when you want  you listen  you have high eq  self esteem  and confidence etc    then that end result is the best you can do  that is the charm  the self acceptance  will people love you  not all of them  but some will  the ones that are meant to  you know what social worth you have now and by knowing what youre capable of as your genuine improved self  youll know how to best use it to get what you want  at the end of the day  youre being social to meet a need  not to  be social    ive talked to     s of strangers  at least almost   daily for years  it doesnt make you  more socially capable   sure you talk to people  youre being social  but youre not getting anywhere  those youtube videos giving you  special conversational techniques to practice on strangers  will just make you more self conscious and insecure  social anxiety arises from being super self conscious and insecure which this crap just propagates    the only good advice is about assertiveness  handling your issues  and self acceptance which is more on the self help side of things    reading body language beyond the basics will just make you insecure  you cant predict someones internal state with accuracy  theres too many variables involved and it gets you away from the moment  just look at their actions  with regards to eye contact or finishing your sentences  these come naturally as self esteem and confidence develop  no techniques needed   so where am i getting at    find what you need and use what you have to get it    lets say theres someone you want to network with  you dont need to speak to everyone at the event or even know how to  work a group   all you need to do is to find that person directly  show your value and isolate them  then build that connection you want  if youre secure in yourself  you dont need to be a social god to do this  your lack of insecurity and genuineness will speak for you     its very important to understand yourself  what youre capable  and what you want  it requires self work  not  being social     for example  if you see a cute girl guy in a group and fantasize about them  do you think about joining their group or expressing your love  hold up  what value do you offer to the person  introspection  fun  looks  what is that you need want from them  a companion  a parent figure  someone to sleep with  its important to know because if you let things  just happen  and you  just go for it   next thing you know youre needy af  in an abusive relationship  or forcibly tolerating and sucking up to a group just to sleep with someone  if thats what you want go ahead  but youll be a boat in turbulent waters as long as you stay that way  once you know why you want need them  and what you offer  you meet up with them and see if they meet your needs  then if any of your value is something theyre looking for  you can make someone want something that you have that they previously didnt  but this is manipulative and not sustainabe long term  or healthy     so now that you know who you are  what you offer  and what you want    not what you think people will want for you  or what you think is  normal   what you actually want to put your time into having     its okay to get out of your comfort zone and  be social   but now  its a lot easier because you know the rules of the game  what youre willing to sacrifice  and what you actually want at the root of it    its hard for something to go wrong socially if youre doing it for yourself and you know that youve worked on yourself  a group laughs at you in a mean spirited way  well  you know youre not a shit person so its not your fault  if people are picking on you for an accidental slip of the tongue  those are shit people  youre the best version of what you can be socially  and trying to change that to mold to the group will only harm you  clearly  theyre not meeting your need when youre yourself  so move on  let them delude themselves in their emotions and find people other people who will see the value you see in yourself and be more than happy to meet your need  if its not something you can meet yourself   no mental gymnastics needed to be social with these people  ,0
is anyone else accidentally rude all the time  no idea if anyone else has this  but it seems im rude and or hurtful all the time without meaning it   like  sometimes i say things that are meant as compliments  but they come across as very mean  or i ask someone to do something  but its in an apparently rude way  stuff like this happens very often   whenever i say something stupid like that  i dont get it at first  until someone else tells me  and then i manage to imagine myself in the other persons situation and i start to feel bad  its like speaking before you think  but at other times  i think of every scenario before saying something because im quite shy   but even then i might still say something rude   its gotten to a point where i almost think i might be autistic or something  even though people told me that im probably not   does this happen to anyone else  i guess it comes from social inexperience  i hardly had any friends until high school and just stayed inside  gaming all day   does it get better when you socialize more  ,0
quick tip for self concious people  an argument against the dont give a f    mentality  if you browse this sub you probably have some form of anxiety  if youre self conscious  its probably a sort of social hyper awareness that clouds your ability to be present because youre busy analyzing peoples microreactions to your manerisms and the things you say  if this is the case  youve maybe at some point or another picked up the try not to give a fuck philosophy in attempt to reduce the amount of mental energy it takes to socialize and be fully yourself  now this is well and good but heres another way of looking at it  what i believe to be the better way  youre someone who cares a lot about what people think of you  why not embrace that  youre extremely perceptive  you do give a fuck whats on others minds when they interact with you  put care and effort into socializing because its something youd like to be good at  if youre with a group of people  pay attention to every participant  if someone interests you  ask them more questions  if you feel like someone who wants in is being left out  try to incorporate them  as long as youre being polite and showing proper manners  everyone will appreciate your presence  if none of the people in the group peak your interests its no problem to politely leave  if you are for some reason obligated to remain in the interaction  why not try being the interesting one  the thing is  trying to be someone who doesnt give a fuck when you clearly do can come across as ingenuine and make you an easy target for ridicule  rather than trying to tear down your foundation of social skills  focus on building up what you already have by learning manners and etiquette to add on top  this will in turn give more depth to your character  ,0

i messaged a guy i liked i am    years old and today was the first day i stepped out of my comfort zone and messaged a boy i liked  granted  he said he was talking with someone else and didnt want to lead me on  but i cant stop thinking about how proud i am of myself for taking that leap    i would have never put myself out there like i did and even though it didnt go as id hoped  it feels pretty awesome to know that i have that confidence in me  ,0
being awkward and weird doesnt mean you cant be social i moved to australia in my early   s  back then i was fat  unhealty  socially awkward  depressed and barely speak english   believe me  being awkward and weird is nothing compared to the extra language barrier challenge  i was the epitome of the fat loser that nobody cares about  but then  one day i told myself that i have had enough of this shitty life i had and decided to change myself    the first thing i did was not trying to improve my social skills  but my confidence  by started hitting the gym  i started to get more healthy  i saw the change in my body and i gained a tiny bit of confidence from that   that tiny bit of confidence gave me the guts to join a local social community  i remember the day i tried to register for that community  it took me few hours to gather the bravery to hit that send button to notify the contact person of the community  i had anxiety attacks  i scared shitless  i know it sounds irrational but for someone that have terrible anxiety  to have the courage to say hi to a stranger takes almost all the energy of the universe  but i did  i sent that message  i was panicking waiting for his reply if i could join the community  having all these weird thoughts and getting scared shitless from getting a rejection  but he didnt   first few times i went to that social community  i felt so anxious around so many people i felt like i wanted to puke  i literally ran away a couple of times from a social gathering they were having  but whenever i did that i felt so guilty for losing to my anxiety    then  i reached out  i reached to one of the  leaders  of that community group  and it was him that taught me  and with my broken english i explained my situation then he told me  quote  its not your fault for being weird  its their fault for hating you  they are people who were born with leprosy  they did nothing wrong  but people hate them because of that   thats when everything clicked with me  its okay to be weird  its okay to be awkward  what matters is do you love yourself   if you cant love yourself  how can you expect people to love you   from then on  i tried  for years  to love myself  i try to talk more  talk whatever  boring stuff  serious stuff  happy stuff  my failures  whatever  and to my surprise  there are people who love me  who cares about me  not many  but there are   friends  you can be weird  you can be awkward  i dont care  but please please please please  always remember that there will always be someone out there who love you  who cares about you  only if you try accept who you are  start from there  youll be the  social  person you want to be  ,0
don t be needy and stop trying to control your experience two of the biggest reasons why you have so much anxiety is neediness and trying to control your interactions  experiences and outcomes   let s tackle neediness first  why do you crave something from everyone you meet  why do you want acceptance and approval  why do you need people to tell you you re okay before you can believe it  there will never be a time where everyone response well to you all the time  repeat to yourself before and during interactions   i do not need anything from you   that s it  do it often  learn to be agenda free  as long as you need something from people you meet and interact with  you will never feel at ease because they hold power over you   control over your experience usually takes the form of trying your hardest to control outcomes  you re so worried about not being able to handle poor outcomes that you life your life playing it safe you craft the perfect text message  you search for the perfect response  you have to make perfect logical sense  when you can t figure these things out  you get anxious because you re afraid of the outcome  your inner child says that poor outcomes are dangerous  so you live your whole life micro managing your experience  doing things that make you feel safe and when you can t micro manage and make mistakes you feel like shit  your anxiety stems from this micromanagement  the world is a big  complex place and try as you might  you will never be able to control it  you need to start jumping in unprepared and trust that you can handle whatever comes  talk before you ve fully formulated a thought  stop thinking two or three steps ahead and anticipating a bad outcome  like not approaching someone because you don t know what you will say after hi  live outside your head  you think too much  peace  ,0
i struggled with social anxiety most of my life and in the past i couldnt talk with strangers  now i work as a cashier at a supermarket and today i accomplished to compliment a customer on their sunglasses   first of all i wanna apologize in advance for grammar mistakes  english is not my first language   i used to not be able to order in restaurants or to cashiers and things like that  and when i started to work in customer service i had to force myself out of the anxiety  basically   even though its been years i still struggle to seem  normal  in a way  to not speak awkward  this job at this supermarket chain its very wall paid  and everyone in my country talks about how hard is to get in  i got in this summer and i was so proud of myself  they called me again to do a substitution  and i have a lot of possibilities to then making me a long term contract  so im forcing myself to be the very best i can be  and be socially awkward doesnt look good in this job  today i was at the cash register and i saw  a woman with some cool sunglasses and instead of keeping the thought to myself i told her that i love them  she was very happy with me telling her that and we engaged in a very fun small talk conversation afterwards  its something little but after all this years im very proud of my progress and the fact that i could have a nice  well paid job because my efforts  and i just wanted to share it with someone  ,0
if you try to start a conversation with a person  or a small group  and you approach in a positive way and arent interrupting their conversation  if theyre purposefully being rude  non receptive  or condescending to you  theyre not worth your time    before looking at from your angle  view it from the angle of being someone being approached by a stranger     even if you dont vibe with that person  if youre a well adjusted confident person  you would respond to them  but you might just be a bit distant in how you respond  youd be respectful  but show some signs of being non receptive to indicate  hey ill be cordial with you  but im not interested   then  assuming that stranger has some social experience  they would get it  and they would respectfully and cordially move on   if someone approached you in a positive  socially understanding  and respectful way  thered be no reason to be condescending or rude to them  youd just be an asshole in that case  regardless of what mood you were in that day     with that being understood  if youre going in to speak to someone or a small group respectfully and positively  if theyre cold  theyre not interested  which means its not worth your time  if theyre rude or condescending  thats on them  not you    ,0
tips for those with social anxiety still working on this list  i d love to see other ideas      don t be so hard to please  small talk is just fine when you first meet someone  you don t have to jump into a deep philosophical discussion for an interaction to be meaningful      learn about some common topics of discussion  sports  entertainment  and work  learn the names of famous athletes  actors  and musicians and learn about their art  watch some of the same sources of entertainment as your peers  even if you have to suffer through it at first      get good at a skill that affects your peers  if they see you as someone who can help them they will make much more effort to carry on a conversation with you  and they will be more forgiving of your initial awkwardness      have opinions  give your opinion boldly when you can defend it  otherwise ask questions and try to formulate an opinion during conversation  people want to know who you are and what you think  don t hide behind the obscurity of neutrality or ignorance or they won t feel comfortable around you      it s okay to break eye contact when you re talking  when you are listening you don t have to give small reactions to every piece of information someone says      don t assume anyone is trying to bully you or degrade you  everyone makes mistakes in etiquette sometimes  don t call your peers out for bad behavior  you re not their authority      meditate in the morning and evening  this can help you learn to focus your mind on one thing and block out the useless noisy voice telling you that you re awkward      read a book out loud to yourself in private  the more you do this  the more you will feel confident in your vocal acuity  when doing this try to avoid speaking in monotone  every sentence can have emphasis  ,0
how to deal with small talk  o  i know the small talk is one of the worst things about meeting people  so here are a few super helpful tips that i learned along the way to help you deal with it        compliment   assumption   whenever you are meeting someone new  if you just give a straight out compliment  things can turn into awkward silence very quickly  however  if you make an assumption after the compliment  i love your shirt  are you a stylist or something    the compliment itself will seem less random and awkward plus you will immediately deepen the conversation  now you can talk about what they or you do  hobbies  interests      best part about it   it doesnt matter if your guess was true or not      avoid questions with   word answers   instead of asking for how long have they lived in new york  ask them why they like living there  what do they do for fun  what is the best and the worst thing about living there        play a game   if you see the conversation is taking a dead end or you catch yourself asking a boring question  so hows work   you can turn it into a guessing game  wait  let me guess  something tells me that today was boring up until your boss came in wearing the most ridiculous pink t shirt   once again  you dont need to be right  also  try not to do this to ofter because it can easily become repetitive and weird      hey  i have a quick question for you   whatever you find interesting   you can go really light with this  who do you think has a better outfit  me or my friend  or really deep  especially with people youve met before  what do you think makes a good relationship    hope this helps  also be aware that i gave examples on things i find interesting to talk about  dont just copy paste me  make it so it is enjoyable for you     if you have any extra questions  feel free to dm me or comment below  i love to chat about this sort of stuff  d ,0
i think i just fixed my brain so today started out awful  one of my most anxious days at work  i m at a store where i m the only one on shift  i felt like everyone thought my new haircut looks really stupid and that i look really skinny and weak from not going to the gym during covid  then i had someone ask about a course that s taking me longer to complete and it felt like they were being very snide about it and mocking me  i was assuming everyone was looking down on me and every customer was at least a little rude  then  i m in the middle of an anxiety attack  which rarely happens but hit hard today  a customer asked where something was and i kind of half assed a response saying it was on the other side of the store    he walked past me and said  your customer service sucks     man   that hit different  the initial feeling of anger that i was already feeling from the busy store and panic attack reached a new peak  but damn it i respected him for saying it  and i needed to here it  i replied something along the lines of  alright buddy  because at that point that s about all i could get out  my mind was in shambles  he ends up tipping me  i was not expecting that  obviously   i did some reflecting after being told my customer service sucked  i was thinking about how hard it is to smile when every customer is so rude and unappreciative  but then i remembered the term self fulfilling prophecy  it stuck in my head but i didn t remember exactly what it meant so i researched it a bit    for those who don t know a self fulfilling prophecy is when you believe something to be true about a person  it has a way of becoming true  so when i  feeling insecure  saw a customer come in i would immediately think they would be another rude customer  this thought would influence my actions and i would be uncomfortable around them and act like they were rude  these actions would impact the customers beliefs about me which caused rude actions towards me  and these rude actions towards me would complete the vicious cycle by reinforcing my beliefs that most customers were indeed rude    so i started viewing everyone like they were the nicest people i knew and it blew my mind how easy it was  most people have really good qualities if you look for them  and people love when you see the good in them  apparently    i ve been applying this mind trick and have completely cured my anxiety attack and have been having some of the best interactions that i ve ever had  ,0
something that has really brought me out of my shell      no matter how awkward you are to someone else  no matter how bad you fuck up on talking to the girl of your dreams  no matter if you pissed your pants on stage while giving a speech   one day  everything on earth will be gone  all of the worlds greatest accomplishments  all of the worlds greatest mistakes  will be engulfed by the sun  it only matters  because you think it matters  but in the grand scheme of things  nothing here on earth really matters   so take that chance  make those mistakes  because at the end of the day  we got one ride  might as well make it entertaining  ,0
this changed my life and helped me not have social anxiety im really not going to articulate this well  but somewhere i read something to the effect of this     x   b    focusing on the people around you instead of on yourself will help with social anxiety       x   b   i really took this to heart  pondered what it meant  and tried it  let me tell you     it works    in social situations  rather than thinking about what i look like  if i am appearing normal  or what others must be thinking about me  i turned it all around  i started thinking about what others look like    what are they doing with their hands  what is their face doing  etc  what are they saying and does it makes sense  where are they looking and how must they be feeling  all of a sudden  i realized people arent too worried about me  in a good way  i realized that theyre not thinking im weird or that im doing things wrong or saying the wrong thing  in fact  somehow  its like they somehow knew i was thinking more about them and therefore felt more connected to me in a chill sort of way     x   b   of course  this is contrary to my default and it takes effort to break free of my previous mindset  but when i do  my social anxiety vanishes and i am free      x   b   i hope you can experience this  too  ,0
any else feel super social sometimes  and super shy other times  for me this comes in  waves  almost  a period of feeling confident and social  and a period of feeling shy  nervous  and not knowing what to say  im not sure why this is  and ive forced myself to try and socialise even if i dont feel like it  but really no matter what  i always have that period of feeling shy and nervous  one of my jobs is literally just talking to people as a job as well  and sometimes on this job i feel shy and dont know what to say  anyone else experience this   ,0
it s weird to think some people don t feel anxiety sometimes when i open up to people about anxiety they give me very basic answers like  try talking to people   or they compare anxiety to something strange  like not being able to sleep because of a sound in the room  my dad did this once   then i have to remember that not everyone experiences this  not everyone will exactly understand    this hit me when i wrote my personal essay  about my struggle to connect social anxiety  for my college application and my teacher who i asked to review it literally couldn t understand the points i wrote about describing my experiences  i even tried to personify the anxiety  thinking i was clever  and she didn t think it fit  i think she even left a comment saying something about just trying to reach out of my comfort zone and talk to more people or something  she wasn t rude or anything  it just hit me that she s literally never experienced this before and i could tell by talking to her about it    this is kinda an old story but i just think about it a lot and notice it in people a lot more  it s just so alien to me i guess  no offense   edit   wow thanks for all the upvotes  wanted to add i don t struggle with anxiety as much anymore  this was a essay about overcoming anxiety  i do however still experience anxiety in class a lot  also wanted to add i know everyone experiences anxiety as a feeling but i meant i think it s crazy not every struggles with it socially  thank you for all the kind comments  ,0
when nobody invites you to hang out  you can always invite yourself  so i was talking to this girl on okcupid  shes shy  new in town  were like minded comrades  theres a part of town weve never explored  she suggests hanging out at that part of town to explore  however shes apparently working some ridiculous schedule and is going to some two week vacation someplace  she responds on occasions  days pass  she mostly drops off my radar for a bit   the good thing is that i dont have to have friends to explore the city with  so i went by myself  i walk into a divey bar and looked around  couple of people who come with one friend  but i see one dude sitting by himself talking to a couple of people  i could tell hes there to chat up strangers so i sit by him and chat him up   made a new friend  ,0
i notice that when a friend slightly upsets me or i feel wronged in some way  i subconsciously try and make them feel guilty or bad about it  its like a built in  rub it in their face that they made a mistake  type of thing  i feel like it is an extremely toxic thing that i have been doing since i was a small child and one of the many bad traits i would like advice on not doing  it is a very nasty combo with my constant need to be correct  because then even if i am wrong i sort of pressure people into believing that i am right  i know this sounds extremely bad and i would agree  but i want to take the steps to start cleaning up my many toxic tendencies  ,0
i asked a girl if she was single i can finally nerd out like you guys  all caps hype  it was intense as hell but only lasted like one second   she said no but it was totally chill and not even that awkward    i was always curious how to start talking to a random girl  apparently asking if shes single works  i followed up with reasons why i was interested n stuff too  im just really proud of me rn lol ,0
i asked a girl if she could hang out with me after class tomorrow this was over text and i just went for it  trying really hard to get my hopes up or get insanely anxious  i havent asked anyone to hang out for years  i had agoraphobia so i was a bit of a hermit  recently ive been trying to put myself out there despite how much it might hurt  its not a date or anything but its a victory that i even mustered up the courage to ask  will try to update this post when if i get an answer   edit  she said she cant because she has a boyfriend  oh well ,0
made out with a girl after a long convo about social skills and self improvement in general im going to try to keep this as short as possible so as not to drone on  ive always been incredibly shy and always would keep on shying away from social situations but the past year i took on the challenge of socializing more  taking calculated risks at least  x a week  and the results have been amazing so far  this year i took it to the next level and im trying to socialize on a regular basis  this has led me to get into many different social circles  and since last august onwards im trying to keep it real  whenever im chatting with someone i try to be vulnerable and talk about things im genuinely interested in if i get the chance   so last night as i was playing soccer  there was a really cute girl watching  i got a bruise on my foot and had the chance to go talk to her as i got injured    we started chatting about general and trivial stuff  offered her a popular drink in my country called  mate   and then as the game finished i offered her to go somewhere else  found a cool bar nearby and then we kept on chatting for   hours on end until i realized i was getting nervous because she seemed somewhat interested in me and yes  call me weird or whatever  but this triggers an endless chain of reactions because i can easily deal with rejection but its the opposite when someone shows signs of interest  then i started rambling  but out of nowhere i opened up and confessed her i was trying to up my social skills and game and never made it that far conversation wise and flow in general  keeping someone interested in me  i realized i was crushing it  that my endeavors towards bettering my social skills were paying off    so i told her that  talked about my struggles  also mentioning this subreddit and how it was helping me in my journey  and from then on something resonated within her and she started talking about her own self improvement journey  how she was working towards loving herself more and so on and so forth  we kept talking for   more hours and then  all of a sudden  we looked at each other  the connection couldnt get any better  and yes  magic happened  we went for the kiss and it felt incredibly amazing  it was pure  real  genuine     so yes  anyone can develop social skills even when you are the most introvert in town like me and whats more  you dont have to be concealing your progress and battles  you feel extremely relieved when opening up and delve into your struggles and whats making you uncomfortable  it goes a long way to do away with anxiety and discomfort in general  yes you will go through ups and downs  but get out there and start crushing it  build that momentum  its so important  ,0
how i asked out my crush   my confidence level said      long story  oh man  i faced my fear in a brutal way  but it made me proud of myself  probably would call it  the hard mode approach    i have a crush on a girl in my class and i made excuses to avoid approaching her everyday    i told my friend  let s call him mike  about my secret crush and he said  mike   bro  you should ask her out as soon as possible      me   she s always with her friends    i only want to ask her out when she s alone   mike   if you don t ask her out today i will punch your face  you should hurry up and do it dude  it doesn t matter if she s with her friends    me   ok if i don t ask her today  you can punch me    the punch thing is a joke    then we shake hands after the conversation   i see her standing alone  and what do i do    i walk past by   mike stops me   dude what the fuck are you doing   she s standing alone  you said you were gonna approach her when she s alone     me   really  i didn t see here where is she    of course a stupid lie by me   mike responds   you are a pussy bro  work on yourself      it was always a big problem for me to talk to girls  but approaching a girl who s with her friends    that s even harder  and i have been working on myself a lot to be a confident person    i see boys flirting with her and she s enjoying talking to them  never in my life i was this jealous and angry     then my mind said   come on  this is it  stop making excuses and do it for god sake  stop putting you through this pain and approach her     school is coming to an end and i could feel my heart start to pound   mike looks over to me and gives me the disappointment face   i was nervous as fuck  the bell rang  everyone stood up and i just saw my crush with her group of friends going outside     friends with her   mike said to me quietly   go     and points at my crush     i didn t say a word and nodded my head  i was walking behind my crush  took a deep breath and said her name loudly     my crush and her friends turn around and look at me  my mind   holy shit  this is it    me   i need to talk to you   her   okay   me   do you remember when you sent me that audio where you tell me what our last homework was    her friends in the background     oooh what is going on with you two haha   oooh you both texting or what   i tried so hard not to get nervous blush  but for some reason i kept my cool confidently   her   yes  i do   me   well  i just wanted to tell you that you have a cute accent      her   aawww thank youuuu   then we started talking about her accent and where it s from  after that it was time to ask her out   me   hey  we should go on a date    her   yeees we should        then i made plans with her  i don t know what was going on  it was like a super power that made me a complete confident person for a minute     i had a confident body language  i spoke slow and loudly  i wasn t nervous at all  even my friends said   dude  how weren t you nervous    well  i m glad that i faced my fear and what is my reward   a date with the girl i like   i hope this inspired many others    ,0

cut off your toxic friends it s not worth it  trust me  being a little lonely is much better than having a group of toxic friends   edit  i didn t think this would get to the front page so i didn t put much  but don t make a scene  just cut them off  ,0
does anyone else feel like its too late to socially develop as much as other people have  i feel like im always going to be  that kinda weird guy  in a group of people  when i was a kid i lived in near isolation and it feels like since i didnt develop my social skills at that age i wont be able to fix it all and be seen as normal    is that just me being too down on myself  have any of you had success with developing your social skills  ,0
anyone constantly replay social interactions in their mind after talking meeting people  after hanging out with people or talking to someone on the phone  i often replay what i said and sometimes regret what i said or imagine what i could have said better  i wonder  did they not like me   or  why didnt i fit in   or  damnit  i shouldnt have said that    i wish i said xyz instead     the degree to which i do this is sometimes pretty extreme where i think it can almost ruin the enjoyment of social interactions    i often pick out the negative things that happened from social events     how does one fix this issue  is it ocd  i also ruminate a lot in general     edit    thanks for all the replies  so many great points  and i hope anyone else stumbling upon this thread will gander through the replies to find ideas that might help them and realize they are overwhelmingly not alone  i didnt get a chance to reply to everyone  but i read every post this morning  and will try to employ some of the advice soon  thank you all  ,0
your happiness is based off your values i was reading a book called  the subtle art of not giving a f  k   i highly recommend it and it has helped me overcome part of my social anxiety    but one section really stood out to me  your happiness is overall based on what you compare yourself to and your values  part of the reason why social media is so detrimental to mental health   if your values and standards of measurement for happiness are being able to provide for yourself and spend time with your family  it is much easier to achieve and hence you would be much happier  on the other hand if your measurement for happiness is to make friends with every person you meet  you will fail and then consider yourself a failure and not be happy because of it even though you might have done an amazing job    dont get me wrong  it is good to set your goals high but set it too high and you may lead to self criticizing and make your life unhappy   be content with what you have  ,0
i was awkwardly nice to someone today and it made her really happy i was working the front counter at a fast food place and this girl came in carrying two bags  both from stores around here  so she s been walking  it was hard to hear her order and it was just an entirely awkward moment  probably more so for her  and i could tell she was shy and stuff  she ordered one item and i let her know i would get her a large plastic bag for all her things  she was so happy  smiling  super happy and smiling  because i offered her a bag for her things  it brightened my day because i brightened hers    i didn t know which sub to put this in  i just hope that all shy and nervous people know that other awkward people get it  ,0

does anyone feel weird  anxious about hanging out with people outside of where they met them   school  work  gym etc  in high school i wasnt the most popular guy  but i definitely knew a handful of people to where if my main friends were absent that day  i still had someone to talk to in class or between passing period  i can make surface level connections fairly easy if were forced to interact  like at work   but to take that outside of the   walls we met in makes me uncomfortable  i never know what to do or what to say because there isnt a specific role for me to fill  were kinda just there  anyone have this or has overcome this anxiety  ,0
stop asking for dates and start suggesting them  for years i have always taken the approach of asking a girl out  would you like to have dinner  or want to grab a beer  something like that  its worked fine  but i feel like it can setup too formal of a dynamic esp if your date doesnt want to be too serious with you   a few weeks ago i just randomly suggested a date with the line lets take a hike  and got a super positive reply from a usually quiet girl  since then  ive taken to suggesting dates like lets grab lunch and a beer or lets get some tea and its gone over very well  rather than a cordial yes or no to a formal question  i am getting responses filled with enthusiasm and character  even when i got a no  it was more thoughtful than anytime i had ever asked for a date    has anyone else ever noticed this  perhaps its a confidence thing   edit  really good technical insight here https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dwgbwf stop asking for dates and start suggesting them f j  su  edit   hikes are indeed common dates for active lifestyle folk    ,0
how do you start socializing again after long period of depression  i    f  have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for about   years  i have it relatively controlled now but it being so severe for so long left me with very little in my life  i quit high school at    after the stresses of high school  bullying and rumours  became too much for me to handle alongside my internal feelings  i have not had a friend since then   slowly i closed off from everyone in my life  things snowballed and now i have such severe social anxiety i can no longer even do simple acts of human interaction like leaving a youtube comment  making a phone call  or even having any social media accounts  i made this one today   i ve never cared what people think of me that s not the problem  i get a freeze flight type of response from any social contact now and i m getting painfully lonely  essentially what i m asking is  has anyone else experienced something similar  how did you go back to being social  ,0
 i dont want to be around other people  should be a valid excuse thats all i have to say  thank you  ,0
how many of you feel like its mostly just confidence you lack  not social skills  and in those rare moments where you do feel confident  you do just fine  you do have social skills  but being nervous makes you feel like an awkward dolt  thats how it is for me anyway  its very frustrating  ,0
  steps toward easy conversation with anyone are you still struggling with any of these problems      you want to talk to people  but you don t know what to say      you want to avoid getting stuck in awkward silences      you re already in a conversation  but the other person seems to be getting bored      how do you make a conversation interesting   if you answered yes to any of these  then follow the   conversation techniques in this article to start eliminating all of these problems     conversation technique    change the subject  this is by far the simplest and most under utilized conversation technique out there   why is this technique so under utilized   because it s extremely common to believe that changing the subject requires a  logical reason  or a  logical transition    for example  if you re talking to another person about movies and a thought pops into your mind about yoga  how do you get from movies to yoga  what s the connection  what s the transition   the answer is that  no transition is required   you simply start talking about yoga  you change the subject unprompted and without any logical reason  doing this is the simplest way to avoid awkward silences  because these silences often occur with you  run out of things to say about a particular topic   you ve  beat that horse to death   so to speak  then you re fumbling around trying to come up with more on the same topic   example   person a   morning    person b   how s it going    person a   not bad  saw equalizer   last night    person b   how was it    person a   the best part was when just kidding  don t want to ruin it for you    person b   so you re saying i should see it    person a   yea  it s worth it  hey how often do you work out    person b   not as much as i should  why    person a   the other day i was at yoga and the instructor   and here you tell some story about yoga     in this example  you simply changed the topic from movies to yoga  no logical reason required     conversation technique    cliffhangers  critical to changing the subject is that you don t need to wait until a particular topic has become stale  in fact  you shouldn t wait  change the subject before the topic has been fully explored   doing this creates cliffhangers  these are unfinished conversational threads which can be returned to later  this is what makes conversation dynamic and interesting   interesting is the opposite of boring  think about it this way   if you play a video game and you ve fully explored every level of the game  is the game interesting anymore  no  because you ve experienced all of it  it only remains interesting when there is more to explore   it s the same with conversation  leaving a topic not fully explored  means that interest remains  the problem is that people who are still learning to make dynamic conversation will get on one topic and just beat it to death  that s how things get boring   example   person a   morning    person b   how s it going    person a   not bad  saw equalizer   last night    person b   yeah i saw that last week  it was really good    person a   yeah there were some epic scenes in there  hey on friday a few of us are going to a beer festival over in   wherever    you interested   person b   i heard about that on the radio the other day    person a   you ever been to one before    person b   yeah up in san francisco a few years back   and now you can tell a story about that event      in this example you changed the topic from movies to beer festivals without any reason or logical transition  you also left a cliffhanger  the fact that you both enjoyed the movie but haven t really finished talking about it   so when you see this other person at the beer festival  what s an easy way to start the conversation   so what was your favorite scene in equalizer      leaving cliffhangers creates numerous opportunities to re enter conversations smoothly and easily     conversation technique    tell them something  the key here is tell as opposed to ask  people want you to tell them things  however  people who struggle with conversation are often hesitant to  tell  people things   the reason  because they think that  whatever they are talking about isn t interesting enough for the other person    here s what you need to understand  no topic is inherently interesting  what makes something interesting is you  it s the passion and enthusiasm with which you talk about something  it s the excitement and interest that you have in the topic  which makes the topic interesting to the other person   what you may have experienced in your life is that when you  tell people things  they lose interest   the reason      of the time  has nothing to do with the topic  it s because you were speaking in a way that was some combination of      meek      timid      uncertain      or simply disinterested yourself   you were not enthusiastic about the topic either because     you though it  wasn t good enough  for them or     weren t even interested yourself but were trying to force conversation   here are the solutions     first     if you want to make interesting conversation  you need to become an interesting person   fortunately  becoming an interesting person is really easy  you just find things to be genuinely interested in  if you re spending your life focused on     i m nervous around people and     i don t know what to say and     i suffer from anxiety  or anything similar  then how can you possibly have interesting things to say   if you refocus that energy into hobbies  passions  interests and dreams  you will greatly advance your knowledge about such topics  then you just need to share the passion with other people     second     every topic is  good enough  for other people  as i said earlier  people want you to tell them things  why  so they don t have to think about what to say   many people have the exact same problem you do   they don t know what to say   so if you tell them things  it     gives them topics to talk about and     relieves the pressure on them to think of topics to discuss   you are basically doing them a favor  when you tell them things  just make sure you tell them with passion and genuine interest  and you ll see your conversations become instantly more lively  natural and free flowing   think back to the previous   examples  there you simply told the other person about a movie and about a beer festival  they never asked  don t wait for people to ask  just tell them     conversation technique    disagree  think about what would happen if all another person ever did was agree with you  wouldn t it become really boring   yes  the answer is yes   it s actually really hard to find another person interesting if they always agree with you  it s like they have no personality or thought process of their own   unfortunately  this happens a lot in conversation without you even realizing it  and it happens because people want to avoid tension and confrontation   now i agree that avoiding confrontation is good  i m not suggesting you disagree by getting angry  yelling and picking fights   what i am suggesting is that you recognize that the desire to  avoid tension  is taken to the extreme by people struggling in conversation and social situations   taking it to the extreme means that you become very accommodating with your words  you  agree  simply to  make pleasantries  or  make the other person happy    the problem is that it doesn t  make them happy   it makes them bored   the solution is that if you have an opinion on something  share it  don t hold back  risk allowing your opinions and feelings to be heard  when you do that  you ll find that it makes the conversation more interesting and the other person more interested in you     conversation technique    situational comments  another under utilized conversation technique is making situational comments or discussing situational topics  this is because it s very common  particularly in dating romantic situations  where people feel like they need to  talk about themselves  or  talk about each other    this occurs because people feel that in order to  get to know each other   they need to share things about themselves with each other  and this is true  but this is also something that can be taken to an extreme   for example  people first getting to know each other will often start bombarding each other with a bunch of questions      where are you from      what do you do for work      what do you do for fun    i could make a list of     more common questions like this    while it s true that eventually you will need to know these things if you re going to become friends  or romantically involved  with someone  but bombarding each other with questions at the beginning creates lots of pressure  which can make the conversation feel  heavy  and  tense    to lighten things up  mix in  situational conversation   make comments on things in your surroundings  things you are both observing  when you see how the other person interacts with the world around them  or how they think and discuss the world around them   you are learning lots of stuff about them anyway  no bombardment of questions required     summary  the key to making interesting conversation is to  mix all of these techniques up   ask some questions  tell them some things  change the subject  leave some cliffhangers  disagree when opportunity presents itself  talk about something situational  ask another question  return to a unfinished topic  from a previous cliffhanger   tell them something else  change the subject   just keep switching back and forth  one to the other   if you ve struggled with conversation and social interaction  recognize that your struggles relate primarily to trying to find  the right thing  to say   there is no  right thing    if you re search for the  right thing  has made you invisible amongst your peers and potential romantic partners  then stop searching for it   instead  just start mixing up the   conversational techniques discussed here and you ll suddenly find other people taking an interest in you

a tip for getting people to say yes to things  ive learned this and practiced it for several years now and thought id share  gently and casually tell someone you are going to do something instead of asking them for permission  if you ask for permission it gives them the impression that they have power over you and that makes them more inclined to say no  a classic example is asking for time off from work  instead of saying  may i take off of work tomorrow   gently say  im not going to be coming to work tommorow  i have  insert circumstances here     i have used this many times and i seem to get much better responses when i do it than when i simply ask for permission  of course you have to know how to say it and the correct tone of voice to use  you cant simply scream at someone  im taking off work tommorow and there is nothing you can do about it   the tone and attitude you use has a lot to do with how effective this will be  ,0
casual confidence is one of the most powerful social skills you can have  when youre just generally confident about what you say  you will be able to talk to anyone about almost anything  no matter where you are  speak with ease and dont overthink about what to say to people  talking to people doesnt have to be a big deal and even a task like some consider  and the more you do it the easier it gets  your brain stores different interactions youve had and after a while  you will be comfortable in any situation   ,0

i turned    today and had   friends to celebrate it with well i am not going to mourn  its been like this for the past   years  never connected with anyone in college  live in a remote town  my batchmates are just a bunch of bullies and carefree easygoers who dont give a shit about anyones feelings and like to indulge in just trashtalk and momentary pleasures  i never allowed myself to be bullied and this led to their aversion against me  i always fought back and they never won against me  this is my final year and i just hope to get out of this wretched place     x   b   would be starting my grad school next year  wish me luck and hope i make a some very great friends over there     x   b   life sometimes just puts you in situations where there is nowhere to go  you feel like crying every day and every moment spent is basically living hell  the only thing you can do is hold your head high  let yourself know that this is temporary  every thing is ephemeral in life and it will eventually end  improve and work on yourself so you give the future opportunities your best fight and so that you never end up like this again  ,0

when you know the old shows  music  and movies that you watched as a kid  its the easiest way to make someone feel comfortable around you  theyll filter their nostalgia and past through you  and itll create a sort of sense of you having been there for longer  i just noticed this  its the weirdest thing  i dont mean relating on shows you currently watch  i mean actual past shows  because then the person feels like you shared their past  and they mentally project an image of you in a favorable light simply for having that commonality in the past  ,0
the   minute rule if someone opens up to you  genuinely  give them five minutes of your time   they could be the biggest drama queen  the most attention seeking whatever  give them   minutes  if they are just attention seeking  it was only   minutes  if it is genuine  you can help them with whatever it is    why  think about it like this  if theyre attention seeking there must be a reason  very few people are truly irrational  most if not all people have the same social fears  and everyone wants to be accepted  some people more than others    so please  if you can    minute no judgement rule  ,0

i feel like tv shows and movies gave me an idealistic perception of how friendships should be like conversations always seem to go well  the awkward characters are either  adorkable  or have some great quality that gives them a happy ending  friendship groups are tight knit and amazing  like in friends and many other shows  i remember as a    year old lamenting over how my friendships weren t all that great  my teenage years were anxiety ridden  now  i ve improved a lot socially  but i ve realized i need to be more realistic  the people i meet aren t well written characters and my life isn t an interesting story all the time  i appreciate my friends a ton  but i keep craving for those amazing friendships too  like i don t even know if those kind of friendships are suppose to be real  maybe they could be real  but i m just doing something wrong  ,0
don t try and solve your friends  problems  listen to them  if they ask for help  then you can begin to help  i ve found this out recently  i have a friend that has a lot of problems in her life  and i hate to see her suffer  but my attempts to help only do two things      annoys her because she wants to just talk about other stuff     makes her think i m more of a therapist and not a friend  seriously  not enough people have friends that really listen to them    you simply being there with them and listening is the best thing you can do  usually     edit  weird  apparently lots of people do this  well at least i ve helped you out  hopefully  idk  here s  https   imgur com gallery  nnz  j  a picture of the sunbaby from teletubbies  ,0

today i finally got my closure i decided to confess my feelings to a girl i really liked last night through a very detailed but long text message  we had a long call today and she told me she only likes me as a friend and treasures me a lot  it may not turn out the way i had hoped for but at least now we know each other more and i can move on with our relationship becoming transparent  i was lucky she did not make things awkward between us and she was pretty chill about everything  we even had a couple of good laughs and although it still hurts the fact i got friend zoned i still feel somewhat glad i shoot my shot anyways  maybe being straightforward isn t that bad after all     edit    wow i was just feeling a little bit down and decided to post this to get it off my chest but did not expect this much support and i just want to thank y all for giving me useful and encouraging advice  i shall now focus on myself from now on and keep my head up    ,0
you re probably not going to annoy them sometimes it feels like you re the only one struggling  while everyone else knows exactly what to say  what to do and who their friends are  but you re analyzing your own actions more than anyone else is    put yourself in their shoes  if someone you know from school casually texted you about getting lunch after class  would you go into a rage  probably not  right  even if you can t make it or just don t feel like meeting up that day  it would almost always feel nice to know someone thought of you and made an effort to spend time with you  next time you have some free time  you may even think of the person who asked you to hang out the other day    other people are almost always in this position as well  people who you d think would have plans every friday night might not  people who you d think would have no shortage of romantic options might feel like nobody likes them  people who are funny and likable may lay in bed thinking about that joke they made that  totally fell flat  and feeling like the scum of the earth    don t make assumptions  and give it a chance  ,0
how to stop being lonely and make friends     principles that transformed my ability to make meaningful friendships over the years  very long but i hope it helps someone  some advice if you feel lonely  from somebody who cares      principles that helped me develop many meaningful friendships    long but hopefully it helps somebody      please dont just read the bullet points  if you are actually struggling with this  it is definitely worth   minutes of your time to read all of this    first of all  for those of you that know me  you know that i sincerely care about people   in my time here on reddit  ive noticed that many people feel very lonely   ive spent the last year reaching out to people in this situation     i used to be very lonely but i figured out some things that have really helped me     my message is to those of you who feel very lonely and feel that you have few or no friends  please take it with a grain of salt an know that my advice comes from a good place     this lengthy post is a mixutre of my unique insight  books and articles i have read  triall and error  and advice i have gotten of the years      im not even going to pretend to know why you might be lonely   it might be because of your poor choices  other peoples choices  social issues  political climates   economic reasons  a tough marriage  or even mental illness   however  over the years  i have had some great success finding and making meaningful friendships and relationships throughout life and wanted to offer some advice for those of you who feel lonely            you have value that you can add to a friendship      you have something to offer others   even if you are  socially awkward individual  or you have  burned a lot of bridges  or struggle with  personal issues     you have  or at the minimum can develop  redeeming qualities that can benefit another persons life     almost  everyone  at a minimum  can offer a listening ear for somebody else   so many people believe that they themselves are  garbage  and  why would anybody want to be friends with me    here is the secret  since so many people believe that they are  worthless  but are at the same time lonely  by the laws of simple mathematics  this means that there are plenty of people that actually need you  for example  that  somebody else  that thinks these same things about them selves could use you as a friend   believing that you have value to add is the start of confidence that can give you courage to make friends  if you cant find this confidence  fake it          you must be the initiator  at least at first    let me be frank  initially  people are not going to be  calling you  to do something with them     youll have to get over this if you want friends and meaningful relationships    truthfully  very few people have the courage  will power  confidence  and energy to initiate a new social friendship   like yourself  others are afraid of rejection  bothering you  or finding the creativity to do stuff   this is not a  sign  that the whole world has rejected you  it is a sign that other people struggle in a similar way as you   what i found out when i first start  initiating  social connections is that many many people were sitting around waiting for somebody to invite  them  to do something  far too often  people are under the belief that  if people dont call you  they dont want to do something with you   isnt it possible  that like you  they are waiting for you to call them  i know what you might be thinking   but if im always the one that has to call others to do stuff  doesnt that mean that they dont really care about me   wouldn t they reciprocate this if they really did like me as a friend   the answer to this is much more complicated   true  some people may be  secretly resenting your invitations and only hanging out with you due to obligation  but what i have found  is that so many other people are lonely and just so grateful that someone was thinking about them  even if they couldnt make it    bottom line  even if people only go out with you only when you initiate  dont over analyze this   most people dont have the strength to initiate   if you really want to know if they are just  going along out of obligation    ask them kindly but directly after a number of social interactions   if they say they are no longer interested in your friendship  move on to somebody more worthy of your time    some tips when being the  initiator    a     have a specific plan in place    it is weird if you just ask  want to hang out sometime    much better to say  hey  i m trying to get a group of guys girls together to go and see the new  fill in the blank  move this friday  you interested    if they say no thanks  it is okay to ask  would you be interested in being invited the next time a group of us get together    this is a casual way to probe if they are ever interested in hanging out     b     best to do the first few activities as a group   this may help them know that you are interested in friendship  and not that you are trying to date them   if you are trying to date them  you will have to look for love advice elsewhere  this post is about making friendships   if the blossom into romance  but my advice is not intended for that specifically   if they ask you  who else is coming  you can float some names and ask them  who else do you think we should invite     c    if everyone rejects you  don t feel bad about going by yourself alone to the event you talked about   this might sound crazy but it it can help with future conversations with these folks   they may ask you  how was that movie  replying with  i didn t go because no body wanted to come with me  is going to sound pathetic   however  replying  it was awesome  you should come next time  might get the ball rolling in the right direction   also  you can try meeting people at the event   it might sound weird  but if really like that kind of event  other people that show up likely like the same thing  which means you could start a friendship on a shared interest    this is called  putting yourself out there  and it is important   i know this works from personal experience  plus   you don t need to have people go with you at a place to have a good time  it is good practice time to learn how to be happy with yourself in  real world settings           you will be rejected  and that is okay  use this as a teaching opportunity but dont over analyze      not every personality clicks   not everyone is meant to be  close friends   and that is ok   think about it  do you like everybody and want to spend tons of free time with everyone   of course not  so why would  everyone like you    life is too short to waste time trying to convince certain individuals to  like  or accept us    there are literally like   billion other opportunities if a certain  click or group of people dont like you    i know that it can be tough being rejected by like    people in a row  but guess what  that is only            percent of the world s population rejecting you  move on   if you think they rejected you for a specific reason that has to do with a character flaw  give yourself    minutes to think this over and dont over analyze it too much  work on those things  but be patient with yourself  you will get better at this             start involving yourself in stuff that forces you to interact with people    our society used to be forced to interconnect with others to survive   we used to literally rely on our neighbors and community for safety  security  food gathering  and marriage procreation opportunities     now  it is entirely possible to live your life devoid of any social interaction  and it happens all the time    if your life only consists of only the following you are setting yourself up for loneliness    wake up    eat  or not    go to work or school  but during breaks dive only into social media or your phone     come home   eat   minimal interaction with roommates or family members     consume media  video games  netflix     feel lonely   head to bed      my question to you is this  when did you allow yourself  or others  to make social connections during that day   even if somebody wanted to get to know you  did you give them a chance       the solution  involve yourself in stuff that forces you to get involved socially     join a club  join a service or volunteer opportunity  join a church  join a club  take a community class  interact with colleagues at work or school during breaks instead of social media  invite a colleague to lunch  etc   get a different part time job that has more social interaction  find a board game or video game group in your area that actually gets together in a physical location once in a while  set aside    minutes a day to call or text past friends or family  btw  ive never met anyone that was offended by how long it has been since you called  most people are just grateful that you reached out    dont worry if you are not       passionate about what you sign up for  that might be secondary to a goal of gaining meaningful relationships   i have also seen many people  including myself  feel some of that void with a relationship with god  something to consider         i also strongly suggest that you do more than just have  virtual friendships  through online communities and gaming   these can supplement your social life  but dont let it become your only social life   you will often end up feeling even more alone if you dont supplement internet friendship with real life experiences in the real world   this balance can be tough for some  but it is worth it in the long run             people have different social appetites  respect this  its ok    one of the biggest problems i have noticed is that when a new friendship starts  people usually have different social appetites and this can lead to a fizzling out or stop to a relationship all together   you might be the person that wants to hang out with somebody once a week  but they might be the person that wants social time once a month  or every day    since it is statistically unlikely that you exactly match  you will almost always be either  over doing it  or  under doing it   there is no perfect solution to this except to be nice  but honest about this  my one advice is that if some one ever does get the courage to finally reach out to you  they are trying to initiate   i would recommend saying  yes  the first time  even if you are not perfectly in the mood or if it isnt perfectly convenient to your schedule   after the first few social contacts  in a  casual way  communicate how often you might like to hang out and ask if they are thinking the same thing   then  respect it   it never hurts to occasionally say  sometimes i think that i am bothering you by contacting you too much  is this the case  i could decreased this a bit if this is true     same goes if it is too little contact   try to keep this casual at the beginning  you dont need to  define the relationship  at the outset  if you dont want to  or cant  hang out when somebody when they invite you  make sure to add  but please invite me again sometime  to give them a clear understanding that you are interested in that friendship            dont spend more than     of the time talking about yourself    seek to be interested in their passions and let them talk about themselves   people get burned out in a friendship if they fell that it is  always about the other person    they are not your therapist  they a friend  which means it needs to be bi directional           ask friends if they want your advice  or if they just need to vent    you will be surprised that most people dont want advice  they just want to be listened to and validated  this will also prevent you from becoming to  bossy  or  know it all  or judgmental with your friends  all of which are big turn offs             dont be overly nice and try to hard    just because somebody went to lunch with you doesnt mean you should buy them coffee and bring it to their desk the next three days in a row   this comes across as creepy and trying to hard   sending a text message   days later with a youtube clip related to something funny you talked about  that is the  play it slow and cool approach  that is more likely to work  then  ask them if they are interested in hanging out again     if someone starts clinging to you too fast  be honest with them and teach them this tip           in the first few contacts  dont over share too many personal  life drama  stories with them    you may eventually where with them things about your  messed up family   life  past relationship  or even mental illness medical issues but trust me that it is not good to lead with this   at first  try to find similar interest  talk about general aspects of life  etc           be patient  and dont give up    this is a skill that may take years to develop  but dont give up   i have seen people follow this advice who started as complete  social outcasts  but have since come to appreciate close friendships

mistakes are only embarasing if you act embarased  this is something i noticed a little while ago  and it may not apply to every situation or every person  but i wanted to share nonetheless   i am a very self concious person by nature  as im sure many of you are as well  and so i am embarased very easily  however  i noticed that i only really cringe at other peoples mistakes if they are visibly embarased by them   example  if i go for a handshake and it falls flat  the most embarasing part about this mistake is my awkward attempt to play it cool afterwards  i might pretend that i was reaching for something instead  but this is an obvious indicator that i was embarased by my mistake   if  instead  i simply retract my hand and just move on without much of a reacting  onlookers will do the same  if i dont make a fuss about it  neither will anyone else   i started to practice suppressing my visible embarrassment and paying special attention to the faces i make when i mess something up  so far  its really helped me be less self concious and caused me to be able to move on from mistakes much more quickly  i recommend giving it a try  ,0
for those who want to learn how to keep a conversation going  sorry for the english not a native speaker  the important thing to keep a conversation going is to give opinion on something you are talking about  this will bring a flow in coversation and will keep it going  so how to learn to give opinion on anything  this doesnt involve going out and practicing with others instead you can practice it all by yourself  so heres the trick  whenever you are using social media or watching news and television give an opinion on any topic which is brought in front of you  for example in social media there are alot of trending topics and posts  give a detailed opinion on every post you see  even if you dont know anything related to the topic   learn about it google about it or ask your friend   this will also deepen your knowledge in every field  i hope you guys understand  this is what helped me kept talking in social events  in social events whenever a topic arises i am able to speak on it and give my opinion  some of my friends even asked me that how do you have such knowledge about everything  the problem is that we use social media and other platforms mindlessly and give attention to things that only interest us  by doing this you will widen your interest and gain knowledge about a lot of things to talk about    hope it helps  ,0

stop being nice many people act nice for the sole purpose of pleasing others and attempting to make themselves feel validated  i noticed that i have this issue and it has impacted me badly so i have made an ongoing commitment to deal with it  when you are a people pleaser  you are being ingenuine and dishonest  this shit makes things awkward and you become very boring because you constantly agree with what others are saying and doing and don t speak your mind for the simple fear of offending them  by being nice you make people see less value in you and make yourself become more vulnerable to being exploited by others    you have to realise that you just can t please everyone  you never ever will be able to  and it s completely okay  its how the world works  i ve been nice for so long and it has done fuck all for me  for as long as you re a people pleaser  you will be stuck inside your own mind and shell and you will continue to have negative thoughts and sometimes even anxiety  the key is just not to give a fuck what others think  you do things the way you do and stop seeking validation  and i know it s so much easier said than done but you have to realise that others don t care much about what you do  to put it more simply  the world doesn t give a fuck about you  you re just like anyone else  you re not special  it s facts  so why then  should you worry so much  think back to your daily lives  how much do you notice and care about what others do  exactly  not much  that s precisely how others view you as well  people focus on themselves too much to care about what others are doing  realise this and you won t be as anxious    nice people tend to put others ahead of themselves and constantly seek the approval of others  this is honestly such a damaging trait to have  now don t get me wrong  there is a distinct contrast between being  nice  and being  kind   the difference between the two is that when you re kind  you are being genuine with your intentions and do it because you want to  whereas when you re nice  you do it ingeuinely and are dishonest to yourself and others because you want to please the other person and get them to like validate you    so many people are nice for the wrong reasons  start changing from this moment onwards  be your true self  don t be dishonest  stop seeking validation  build your self confidence and do shit with honest intentions   do it because you want to  not because you think it ll make someone like you   don t seek happiness from others  start to take control of your lives and do not let others control it for you  the truth is no one gives a fuck about you as harsh as it may seem  this is just how the world works  i promise that when you stop being nice  that doesn t mean the same as stop being kind  that you will live a tremendously better life  also  remember that to stop being nice that doesn t that you should just become a massive jerk  sure  you will without a doubt offend people because you can t please everyone  but don t transition into a dickhead where you put constantly put others down for the wrong reasons because it makes you feel better  i think the more appropriate way to deal with this is to be  assertive  when you need to  whereas a nice person would just let themselves be taken advantage of because they don t want to cause conflict    realise that you will offend people  you will come across people who don t like you  you will never ever be able to please everybody  but don t let it stop you from doing what you want just because others don t like it  don t be a people pleaser because the world and society doesn t reward people pleasers  just stop giving a fuck what others think about you and don t obtain your happiness by seeking validation from others because if this is the way you gain happiness  then you will never ever truly be happy  stop being that fake  agreeable and boring nice person and you will gain massive respect along the way and you will build stronger relationships with others  there s no better time to start doing this other than right now   i just felt like i had to get this out there  i myself have been a victim for far too long and it s diminished my social status and impacted my social skills  i truly hope this helps many of you guys out there  even if it s just one person i ll be happy that i have made a positive impact on that person s life  best of luck     ,0

improve their social skills rapidly  and the people who just read r socialskills and comment about why how solution x would never work for them   typically code for   im uncomfortable trying            there s a phrase my mentor likes to say         of the work is done before you enter the room     it s easier to start a conversation after you ve had a successful conversation   so  how do you start those conversations   enter conversational muscle memory   conversational muscle memory is built on the idea that when you start small  low stakes conversations throughout your day  its easier to start more conversations because you ve built momentum   once you ve built that momentum  it ll be easier to start a conversation with that one person you really want to talk to   imagine   you start your day by grabbing some coffee at a nearby starbucks    the guy in front of you is looking at the food behind the glass case  he seems indecisive   you   gotta go with the banana bread  it s my favorite    him   heh  there are so many choices  i can never decide    you   just get them all    him   haha  then i might have to take the rest of the day off    you get to the counter and place your order   you   so what time did you have to come in this morning    barista   oh  i got here at         you   whew  that s way too early for me  i need my beauty sleep    barista   chuckles   well  i m kind of a morning person  so it works out    congrats  two conversations started  but you re not done   you call an uber to work   you   hey  how s your morning going    uber driver   good  just getting started    you   cool  you think you ll have a busy day    uber driver   probably  there s that big conference downtown    boom  that s three  and you re not even at work yet  go you   notice how none of these conversation starters are particularly fancy  theres no such thing as the perfect line    the most effective starters simply use the shared situation or environment that youre both in   aim to keep it as simple as possible     why does this strategy work     in the      olympics  hockey star sidney crosby scored a game winning goal for team canada in overtime   a reporter asked crosby to take him through the game winning shot     i didnt really see it    crosby replied   wait  what   crosby was functioning purely on procedural memory      procedural memory allows you to make a behavior automatic   after practicing conversational muscle memory  you dont think  you just do   this creates an automatic cycle of starting conversations     but what if you feel nervous when its time to start a conversation     after having         conversations  i still get that anxious feeling right before i start my first conversation of the day   only i label that anxious feeling something else     anticipation   when i anticipate something  it changes the game completely  suddenly  i can go from resistance to acceptance  it makes interactions so much more fun   this subtle shift also changes my focus from myself and my internal state to other people and the environment around me   which is great for starting conversations   but what about other people  wont they think im weird for starting conversations with people   not really  theyre too busy thinking about themselves  as long as youre not making people uncomfortable or stopping them from continuing about their day  youll be fine     body language tip  look at peoples feet  if they are pointed towards the door  they may need to leave    theres this concept called the spotlight effect     its responsible for the tendency of people to overestimate the extent in which others notice aspects of their behavior   so i wouldnt worry excessively about other people     how can you start using conversational muscle memory     theres a simple framework that will make it easy to get started today called if when then   simply put  if when then strategies give you an in the moment blueprint for new behaviors    i learned if when then from robert cialdini s book pre suasion    examples   when i get coffee at starbucks  if there s someone in line  then i ll start a tiny conversation with them   or   when i walk into work  if there s someone near my desk  then i ll start a tiny conversation   using the if when then framework will help you become automatic  just like sidney crosby     action step    for five minutes  brainstorm two typical scenarios where you could use if when then   when i          if there s someone          then i ll           should i stay or should i go   when i laid out this strategy to one of my clients  he asked me    what if i start a tiny conversation  and i end up having to leave  or a rambler gets started talking about model trains or whatever weird thing they re into          valid question  my answer   have an exit strategy  of course   example   new friend    and that s why i moved to the city    you   hey   extends hand  it s been great talking with you  but i ve got to get going    let this script be the safety net for you so that you can start as many conversations as you want   now that you have several tools in your batman utility belt  what s the next step   tomorrow  start two  or more  tiny conversations using conversational muscle memory     who am i     im a recovering awkward person  i hope this helps you start better conversations with your fellow humans  good things happen when you open your mouth   if you want to know a bit more about what i do      look at my flair  thats my blog  go there for more stuff like this   podcasts

friendship is becoming a burden and i wish i never even tried to make friends jesus i didnt realize it required this much work to stay friends with somebody  or call out a friend on bad behavior or even to just keep up with a clingy friend   i feel like i made a mistake    i know someones going to come at me with the you have to open yourself up and go through bad situations to get to the good bs and i get it  its the truth  but im so fucking annoying with this  i hate this drama  i am the type to ghost people or distance myself from them till they forget about me  instead of not being a coward and facing people  i just ghost  because friendship is so damn stressful to deal with sometimes  ,0
being an introvert is not the same as being socially awkward dear my socially awkward friend    i keep seeing posts that say   im an introvert so its hard to make friends blah blah blah   my friend  there is a huge difference between being an introvert and being socially awkward   just because you are an introvert  does not mean you cant make friends  there are many great introverted leaders out there  everytime you say   im way too introverted for  insert social related activity   is basically you making an excuse to give up making friends    get out of your comfort zone and stop making excuses  join a new community or a club  greet people  shake hands   remember to smile and if something awkward does happen  laughs it off  be your weirdest self and express yourself  if people dont accept who you are then its their loss  not yours  remember that even great leaders who are often to be in front of a crowd has their own anxieties  but what makes them  great  is they face those anxieties and do it anyway  dont give up  my friend     yours truly    someone who conquered his depression and suicidal thoughts and still actively learning on how to be better       edit  i see that my post actually manages to inspire some people so let me share my story       i was never good being social since my school days but i never really realised to that i was bad  like terribly bad  until i transfered from my college to study abroad  before i transfered  i was always surrounded by a doting family telling on  how awesome i actually am   the constant doting actually blinded me that i was actually  awesome   my friends at school liked to tease me and i thought they do that because they liked me  i realised that they did that because they looked at me as the  weird kid nobody wants to be friends with  only after one out of very few good friends of mine told me in my face that i was super weird  a year after i graduated from highschool  we are still good friends  he told me that i was weird as a friend and was not trying to insult me    when i transfered to college studying overseas  thats when it hit me really hard  i just realised how lonely i was  far from home and the very few friends that i had  i tried to make friends but i felt like i couldnt adapt with the whole new culture here  i started to think that the world was just unfair  i was born different and a complete loser  i spent my days with college and staright home  locked myself in my room  alone  doing nothing but playing games for hours and days   i legit spent almost a year  alone  well  a minimum human interaction  i started to feel extremely lonely which turns to stress and then depression  i started to have suicidal thoughts  i could get panic attack from absolutely nothing  getting angry at night  punching my pillow over a small problem    one day  i woke up  i told myself that ive had enough  i actually tried to find friends and luckily  i managed to find a new group of people that actually cared about me  thats when i started to think   hey  life is actually not all bad  it isnt all gloomy and bullshits  there is actually a beauty in it  only if you try to look for it   that gave me the determination to step forward  i joined local gym club  a new community  be involved with the student council at my college  mind you  everything didnt just happen like that  even after i forced myself to be more active  there were still days when my panic attack came  especially in a middle of a crowd  there were days when i felt like i should just give up  i felt like all these new  being more social  was very tiring and draining and i should just go back home and locked myself in my room and play games  but i was determined enough to say  fuck it  lets do it    from there on  i started to make friends  one by one  found people that love me  help me with my social skills  now  i am the happiest ive ever been  i have friends more than ever   true  friends  im still a little awkward  and i dont think ill completely fix that because thats a part of me  but the difference is  i embrace it with pride because thats what makes me unique  i learnt to love myself and in return  people also love me   my friend  im telling you  my journey was long and tiring  in fact  my journey has not ended yet  there are still many things in this world that i have yet to discover  i promise myself that i want to be the best version of myself and make those people who were there to lift me up during my lowest proud  i want  i must and i will   im going to end this post with a question  my friend  will you join me in the journey to be a better person  ,0
leaving a nice note for your waiter waitress   i started doing this because i was doodling a lot while going to waffle house every morning  i wrote my waitress a little note saying  thank you for the great service   i hope you have the most wonderful day         i didnt think much of it  it was just a simple two sentences  until i went back and she immediately recognized me and started going on and on about how i made her day that day and she keeps the note in her purse with her and reads it whenever she has a bad day    so i started doing this all the time and it just made me feel a lot better that i was potentially making somebody elses day better  with each note i would personalize it and thank them for certain things or make a joke or something  today i left a note for my steak and shake waiter saying  im sorry i only have two dollars for your tip     but thank u for the great service and i wish you a wonderful day    edit  my meal was about    and i gave him     but he was so great i wish i couldve given him more  im not  saying its okay to undertip and write a note in its  place    in fact u should over tip and leave a note     i walked out to my car and he literally ran outside to yell  youre awesome  have a great day   and i realized how much better ive gotten with talking to waiters by doing this  the waffle house girl actually jumps with joy every time i come in and we always chat   is such a nice experience and im so happy i started doing it and i thought i would share        edit  my first silver    wow    thank you so much     i wasnt sure about this post when i wrote it but im so glad everybody is getting some good out of it and i wish all of you a wonderful day       edit     wow i cant believe ive touched somebody enough to give me some gold    it makes me so happy to see everybody commenting and feeling encouraged to start doing this and i now feel encouraged to do it even more so  all the positivity on this thread has really made my day and i hope you all feel the same         ,0
i    m  went to an event alone for a whole weekend  i took the leap and went to an event that was hosted at another university two hours away  i rented a cheap airbnb for the weekend and went for it  of course i knew no one and at first  it was awkward but i dont regret a single decision  i made bonds with all types of people and made friendships that i know will last  im usually a massive introvert but this weekend during an after party for the event i was even able to  shoot my shot  at a really cute girl i had a crush on during the event and got her number  i just want to let people know that if you put yourself out there and keep an open mind you are bound to make meaningful relationships  ,0

is maintaining relationships and talking to people suppose to be tedious  i    f  have very few friends and am still generally new to socialising  i have recently noticed that after talking people for a few minutes  i feel exhausted from them  to the point where it feels like i need days on days to  recharge  and talk to them again  this happens with new folks who im trying to be friends with  old friends that ive known for years and just general acquaintances  is this a normal experience  it doesnt feel like it is cause i assumed friendships were stuff you enjoyed  is it maybe incompatibility with the people im talking to  ,0
why do people who otherwise have good memory recollection  repeat themselves over and over again as if they have never told you the story before  and how to you respond without coming across as rude   are they unaware that they are repeating themselves  or are they just using repetition for emphasis   by  story   i also mean ideas  opinions  etc    ,0
i always start to dislike my friends  help  this probably sounds weird  and i know this post will make me sound like a bad person  but i really want to figure myself out and stop this   long story short  every time i make new friends or find a new social circle  i start to dislike them after a year or two  its like a switch flips in my head  where i go from   this person is cool   to  wow  i never want to hang out ever again   ive been doing this to different degrees since i was a kid  as a kid  i would flat out ghost people  yeah  i know  not nice   but now  im older and i want to keep my friends and be there for them  even though i want these nice and supportive things  theres still that part of me that wants to ditch them and say good riddance   theres a progression  this person is cool    hang out    get close    switch is flipped    start trying to find excuses to ditch    friendship either fizzles or a fall out happens  ive recognized that theres a pattern  but i dont know how to get out of it  i would never want my friends to know i think this way because it would make them feel bad  heck  i even feel bad for being able to detach myself so easily   at first  i thought i was over idealizing people in my life  but ive never been a black and white thinker and know fully well that people will never act  perfect  because thats a crazy thing to want  this doesnt seem to be my issue  is anyone else like this  what are some solutions   edit  whoa  so i wasnt expecting to wake up to so many responses  theres a lot of people saying they feel the same way  glad to know im not alone  i hope everyone finds a solution that works for them  because it seems like this way of thinking hurts us  anyways  thanks for the comments  sorry if i dont reply because theres just so much here to get to   edit    im deleting this throwaway now  ive been doing a lot of introspection in the last couple of days  and ive come to the conclusion that the first step in finding a solution to these feelings is to reduce my time on social media  reddit included  as some users have suggested  this is burning out my friendships quicker  i also think that the amount of time i spend online is impacting my expectations of what a good friendship looks like and my own self esteem  i should be looking for ways to enrich my life and the lives of others  instead of ruminating on the web  maybe even looking for a therapist   if what im saying resonates with anyone  then i highly recommend checking out r nosurf  ive been finding motivation to change there  otherwise  i hope that others who feel the same way as me find the solutions that work for them  thanks and good luck  ,0

you might be missing out on the people interested in you so i hooked up with a girl yesterday that i had been interested in for a while  i had been trying to make it obvious to her that i was interested in her for some time but i wasnt getting anything back  i was starting to think she just wasnt interested but i thought id give it another shot  fast forward to yesterday  we hooked up and later that night she told me that she couldnt believe someone like me  she used  as handsome as you   was interested in someone like her    what i figured out at that point was that she didnt pick up any of my signs because she didnt believe they could be possible  because of her insecurity she was blind to the fact that i liked her   i felt like this story was relevant to this subreddit because this is most likely not a special case  i can imagine that this happens a lot  by saying to your self that something is out of reach you really make it so   tl dr  met a girl i liked  she didnt see any of my advancements because she thought i was out of her league  if she felt that way there are probably many people that feel the same  ,0
making one small step really does lead to bigger ones until it becomes  normal  i started by complimenting a lady s perfume one day   realized that wasnt so bad    then i made it a goal to randomly compliment at least one stranger every single day   then spark up a conversation with whoever was waiting in line at the lunchroom next to me each day   or at the very least make a relevant comment   then  i started getting more bold and sharing my opinions more   this one kinda hurt because some people actually had rude reactions when they would disagree   but i started to learn that its not so bad   now i have somehow found myself with a group of friends i hang out with every weekend almost and i started as a very shy anxious loner     i m still an awkward guy  but i realized one thing in the very end     no matter who you are  someone will match with you and enjoy your company   you don t need everyone to like you or react positively   that s ok   i m much less  of a pushover too once i realized this   start with one tiny step every day and that little confidence it builds will snowball into more things    please don t give up on yourself ,0
stop waiting around to get invited to things  and plan your own shit   preface  this is something im still not an expert in  im writing this up as much for my own benefit as for yours  after reflecting and thinking on things since the start of the year  this is my own roadmap for improving my social life  and i hope it can be a benefit to others as well  im still at the beginning  but i hope maybe i can help others along the path while im at it      introduction  so youre someone with decent interpersonal skills  you can talk to people face to face  and you make easy acquaintances  but you have trouble building a good circle of friends  and your social life outside school or work isnt as fulfilling or satisfying as youd like it to be  if this doesnt describe you   if you struggle with interpersonal skills   this advice will probably still be helpful for you  but itll help to keep working on improving those face to face skills too   this is the story of many people especially after they graduate college  and have to build their social network in the  real world   especially if you move to a new city where you dont know many people  i find myself in this situation right now  most days and weekends after work i head straight home and while away the rest of the evening with reddit or netflix or video games  or some combination  except for those rare occasions where someone has invited me to do something fun   basically i was sitting around  waiting to be invited to something  more often than not  id end up just sitting around  id wonder why im not more popular  what i was doing wrong  until i realized that so many other people i knew were doing the same thing  waiting around  waiting to be invited to something  so i tried something  i planned a movie night at my apartment  and sent out an invitation  lots of people joined  and were eager to have something to do  which leads me to my thesis     plan your own shit  just try it  i started with a movie night  ive since hosted a board game night  and gmd a couple of tabletop rpgs  its probably easier than you think  it turns out lots of people have nothing to do on any given night  and theyd be happy to join you  i make events on facebook  but you can just as easily use a groupchat  or just text people that youre doing such and such thing on such and such night  and would they like to come   it doesnt have to be anything big  in fact  its probably better to start small  invite people over to watch a movie  plan a hike or go to the frisbee golf course  get a group together for bar trivia  host a smash tournament  invite people to go to a concert  or check out that new bar  or restaurant that opened downtown  even something small and impromptu like inviting a few people over to polish off a bottle of wine or crack a few brewskis and catch up and chat    not everyone will say yes when you invite them  thats fine  maybe theyre busy that night  or maybe theyre dealing with anxiety or something else  you dont know  keep inviting them if you like hanging out with them  maybe youll be able to get them out of their shell  the reality is you might fail sometimes  not every event will be as successful as you hope  and thats ok   heres something important  invite people you dont know very well  and encourage people to bring others  its easy to fall into the trap of only hanging out with a few people all the time  some people only want a small group of close friends and dont really care about meeting a lot of new people  thats fine  but if your goal is to widen your friend group and social network  you should be inviting people you dont know super well  and getting to know new comers who are the friends of people you know already  dont be afraid of what i call  cross over episodes   or social gatherings where your different friend groups intermix  its fine to host an event with your work friends and your school friends  they might even appreciate the chance to meet new people  and most of all  it gives you a chance to get to know people better and meet new people     but that sounds hard   youre not wrong  in fact  the reason you dont have anything to do most nights is that most of your friends probably think its too hard to organize something themselves  so no one organizes anything and no one ends up doing anything   when you organize things and give people something to do  youre giving them something valuable  people like people who are valuable to them  youll probably find yourself better liked and more respected  and youll probably find yourself invited to do more things by the people you meet and grow closer to  people who are really good at this often have very robust friend networks  ive known a few people like this in my life  and they all had active and fulfilling social lives  they befriended me using the techniques that ive outlined  and i was always extremely grateful to them   lastly  it gets easier  the first time you plan something  it might be scary or stressful  start small and easy  and work your way up  in the beginning  you might feel like you have to do everything yourself  but as you meet and grow closer to more people  youll meet people who plan things and invite you     conclusion  if youre tired of your current social situation  take matters into your own hands  stop sitting around waiting to be invited to things and plan shit yourself   ,0
the best way to make friends is to avoid over sharing details about yourself  instead  focus more on learning about him her  i have found that by engaging more in what someone else is doing  making him or her feel valued and like you are genuinely interested in them is the best way to make a friend  they will remember how you made them feel  appreciated and valued  and will associate that with you  and in return  will later become more interested in you  try it out  i promise it works wonders  ,0
  tips you can use to have better  more interesting  less awkward conversations  and   tip you can use to start conversations quickly   preface     ive been seeing a lot of questions lately about how to start and have more interesting conversations  this post was adapted from  this comment   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments bkc tr    year old virginincel need help emfxudb      here are   things you can start testing next week to have better  more interesting  less awkward conversations          the    second win  starting conversations quickly    when we re entering into a social situation  it s really important to get a quick win   lets say youre at a party   what most people do  walk in  grab a drink  and then they check their phone and dont start conversations   a better approach  the next time youre in a situation where you know youll want to be social  as soon as you walk into a party  work  or wherever  start a    second timer in your head   you have    seconds to start walking up to someone to introduce yourself and start a conversation   the reason this is so crucial is because    seconds doesn t give you enough time to overthink the situation  or start feeling nervous   what should you say   here  it s really useful to have a couple of word for word scripts to pull out in almost any situation   no need to overcomplicate this  simple beats complex every time  here are a few of my favorites scripts to get you started     hi  my name s jeff      i don t think we ve met before  i m jeff      hey  i wanted to come over and introduce myself  my name s jeff    notice how they aren t fancy  but they get the job done     action step  think about the next event  party  or situation you might be able to test out the    second win          the iceberg effect  develop a wide range of interests so that you can connect with people    icebergs have a tip that sits above the water  and much more that hides below the surface   iceberg tip  people who seem to seamlessly slide into any conversation and offer an opinion or comment   below the surface  they likely listen to a wide variety of audiobooks  podcasts  and read a few interesting articles per day   real talk   if you spend     of your free time learning about power rangers  you wont be very balanced when it comes to interests  youll be at a disadvantage during those pesky conversations outside of comic con   what we want is interest diversification  off the top of my head  here are   interests that i could speak to right now    swing dancing    podcasting    video production    iceland geology    theodore roosevelts early years  heres the deal     you dont have to know a ton about any given topic  just have a well rounded set of interests  this helps you relate to a wide variety of people    this is also the secret sauce that makes people seem  interesting      action step  learn about one new thing today   use podcasts  audiobooks  youtube  wikipedia  some graffiti under a bridge somewhere     note  if you dont know much about the current topic  be curious  let the other person teach you something new        think around the current topic so youll have something to say    something i teach called  the spokes method  will help you connect with anyone on almost any topic   even if you don t know a lot about the current topic  imagine a bike wheel   in the middle  you have a hub  and radiating out from the hub are several spokes   now  imagine the hub as the conversational topic   the spokes are different  related topics that can be introduced    example  your conversational partner brings up painting  something you dont know much about    should you just stonewall them and say  i dont want to talk about painting   or just nod as say  uh huh  coool    no   dale carnegie  author of how to win friends and influence people once spent an entire dinner party talking  and mostly listening  about botany   his conversational partner told the host that dale was the best conversationalist hed ever met     lesson  you dont have to carry the conversation     do this instead  use the spokes method to  think around the topic  and mention other things that are related to painting      how do you choose what to paint        what kind of painting do you do       id love to see an example of your work     you can go deeper into who the person is by bringing up      you must be very creative        as a kid  did you do anything else artistic        if you could paint anything in the world  what would it be     you can play the role of the beginner with a question like      i dont know much about painting  whats your favorite thing about it      note how spokes can be used to form questions and observations  its important to balance both so that you dont fall into interview mode     wrap up      its easy to overthink social situations  the more small  rapid actions you take  start a conversation  speak up in a group  etc  the faster shift youll have from a mental self image of  i cant do this  to a mental self image of  i can do this    as you have small win and successes  write them down    that way you can more easily remember the good social experiences you have   over time these will crowd out the less positive experiences     bonus  group conversations     i get asked about having better group conversations a

i was able to ask for my food at a restaurant today  i was waiting for nearly    minutes for my food  and people who ordered after me were already eating  i saw this pair ask a waiter to follow up for their order  so i tried to do the same  but no waiter was going to my table despite my hand out and my attempts of calling someone over  i was gonna go to the counter but there were lines of people ordering so i thought thatd take a while  eventually i went to the back kitchen area and there i saw a tray with food just waiting  i asked someone inside  one of the cooks   to check if it was mine since it was the same as my order  i showed the receipt and i waited for around   minutes  then they said yes  usually the food is served to the customer  but waiters waitresses were ignoring the tray with my food on it so i just got the tray and brought it to my table   i ended up tearing up  idk why  i was either angry or anxious  or something else  but good thing i was in the corner and no one saw me  at least i went to ask for my food or else i wouldve ended up waiting even longer   edit  wow i didnt realize this would get so much attention since i was just sharing a small thing that happened in my day  thank you for your comments  tips and advice  i really appreciate it  i will keep them in mind next time     ,0
i joined a club and actually made friends  i    f  am just feeling happy and hopeful  i ve struggled with social anxiety since i was about     it used to be practically debilitating and i couldn t talk in social settings  over the past couple years i have made some great improvements with it  but it s still there just not as overbearing    anyways  last fall i joined a club at my community college and actually made friends  i really wanted to join for a while but it made me so anxious  i walked past the meeting a few times before actually going in  i finally just held my breathe and forced myself to walk in and it was a wonderful choice  i ve made friends with multiple members  we hang out together and have group texts and stuff  i m getting really close with   person    it s also giving me a ton of confidence about social settings  that i can make friends and people do like me  i m growing so much and can t wait to get involved in more  i think it will be even easier for me to walk into something next time  i m proud of myself    ,0
years of faking my personality  acting like someone else  and living to impress others has made me lose all sense of who i am and what makes me happy  what can i do to start fixing myself  in early highschool  something inside my brain decided that if i impressed others and didnt show my flaws in front of people  they would like me and wish they had personalities as good as mine    i tried to act in different ways depending on the situation that would make them like me more  i tried not to be disagreeable and for the most part just went along with what everyone said  and there was no one that disliked me and everyone referred to me as  kind  and  nice     i guess i thought that since all these people referred to me this way  that meant that they were my friends  but i noticed whenever i was around these people who  liked  me i would always be worried if i was doing sokething or acting in some way that would make them dislike me  i was always quiet and rarely contributed to the conversation  i agreed with what everyone said and no one bothered me    then i saw that they werent actually my friends  they would meet up outside school and post on instagram wothout me and it really hurt me and made me wonder why my  friends  didnt want to hang out   when they called my name at high school graduation  everyone in the group got applause when they got up on stage except for me  and it really broke my heart and made me sad because all that time i spent trying to make people like me didnt work    senior year  someone who i thought was my  friend  wrote in my yearbook   when you open up you are hilarious  go to college and show them who you are    i remembered that sometimes if i was happy and comfortable  i did a pretty good job of making people laugh  but that was just me being myself  i wasnt really trying to make people like me when i was doing that   but i dont know how to do that  i tell myself constantly to relax  be myself  be funny but i always end up going back to worrying about what people think of me and if they like me or not because i dont have really any real friends and i really want friends    so i spent all of college scared and worried about whether or not people would like me  my behavior never really changed  and i kind of forgot who i was and what actually made me happy    now  when people tell me to  relax and be yourself   i cant because im not sure who that is  im    years old now and the last time i remember being truly happy and comfortable was when i was a child    when people ask me what it is that i want to do or what makes me happy  i always say  i dont know    whenever i try new thing to see if they do make me happy i can never tell because im not sure i remember what real happiness feels like    sometime i just feel like a shell of my former self  decrepit of any personalith or meaning  i dont know what to do anymore and im scared ill die without ever having lived    ive tried therapy but i always  act   i pretend like i know more than the therapist and theres nothing he can do to help me   ive considered suicide once or twice  but the only thing that stops me is the few fleeting moments in my young adult life where ive made people laugh or ive  almost  been comfortable  also how much i care for my parents and my younger brother  they know im struggling and theyve tried to help but theres not much more they can do  i find im becoming more closed off with them now when they talk to me   i also no longer believe in god so from my perspective  ill be obliterated from the universs once im dead  and i dont want to die without having found happiness   i dont know if i should seek therapy again or go on an acid trip to india or whatever  this isnt how life is supposed to be lived  but ive trained my brain for so long to live this way that i dont know any other way to live  im numb and weak   im even worried that i wasnt being myself in this post but that i was just trying to impress you guys with how edgy i am  but i think i tried to be as honest as i could here   edit  sorry for all the typos  i wrote this from my phone while lying on my bed  edit    i was completely unprepared for this post to get so much attention  i woke up this morning crying  wanting to talk to someone  and there isnt anyone that im comfortable being this open with  so many of you have offered extremely helpful advice and im very grateful  please know ive read every single comment  im really glad this sub exists  thank you all so much  ,0
have you ever realized that being nice worked against you  i am a people pleaser  and i guess i need tips on how to start handling confrontation better  or tips to care less   im worried that i will always be this way   edit  thanks everyone for the advice  im glad im not the only one who feels insecure about this  ,0
texted the guy i like that i like him and i got turned down  but im still feeling pretty good about it  i figured he wouldnt be interested anyways so i wasnt super disappointed  just what i expected   it went well and we just went back to having casual conversation afterward like nothing happened  i feel proud of myself that i did it and now just hoping itll help me move on    ,0

the purpose of friends is to build you up and make you feel better  if you have friends putting you down or making you feel bad  they are not real friends  get rid of them  better to have   supportive friends than    negative friends  my success  confidence and happiness skyrocketed when i did this   ,0
self isolation has led me to think differently and im ready for the future firstly  i  m    hope this post finds you in good health   the last few months have been quite challenging for not only me but im sure for many others out there as well       just looks all downhill   at the start of the year  a mistake costed me my friendship with a girl  f    i  m    knew at university  in february  my family and i went through a lot of personal problems ultimately leading my dad to work out of the country  at the start of march  i realized that the people i considered to be close friends with me at university were really quite immature and plain rude when it came to considering other peoples feelings and opposing opinions  case in point  they started messing with a guys feelings on social media and when i spoke out about it to them  they turned a blind eye to what i was saying   now we are here  at a time during self isolation and a virus pandemic around the world  although everything is going bad around me  i feel as if being in my own space has brought me closer to myself and has allowed me to consider others more than i usually will  some say its because i became emotionally mature but i just call it part of being a human on this earth  ive begun to work closer towards my goals  i began to reach out to that friend after my mistake and i dont want to push them into anything at all  ive begun to help out more where ever i can and be more empathetic to people around me   ultimately  if you are going through self isolation right now  take this time to really work on yourself  think about everything that you can be grateful for and if you feel like doing that thing  go do it   being isolated from the world has ironically brought me closer to it and i think im ready to face whatever may lie ahead  you can too   lets go friends  ,0
have no desire to talk to people but am very lonely just a bit of background    i use to have a lot of friends in high school and i have had two girlfriends in the past    i use to have pretty decent social skills but have always been somewhat shy and quiet    over the last two years i have slowly become a shell of a person  when people ask me to hang out  i rarely want to  i don t have any desire to be around people and pretty much avoid them on purpose  sometimes i force myself to go out and hang with friends  because i don t want to be a hermit  but i never have fun    the problem is that i have nothing to say  i find most conversations so futile that it really bores me to talk to people  i can t really have fun talking about topics that i don t care about  part of it too is also fear  i feel like i can t articulate my thoughts well when i am around people  i think these two reasons go hand in hand      i really don t want to be like this  i think i hurt my friend s and family s feelings since i basically ignore them but i really just hate conversing with people    i actually like most people but can t communicate it  this part kills me  i want to let people know that i care about them but the nihilism that i deal with makes it so hard because i just see conversation as pointless   when i am in groups i feel like a ghost  i don t say anything and people don t really notice i am there anymore as a result  again  i want to change that  i want to be myself like i use to be able to  i feel extremely lonely and really want to have some friends so that i can stop creating problems in my own head and actually have fun  it is a weird dynamic   this is kind of a rant  ik haha  just want to see if anyone else can relate     edit  thanks to everyone who is responding    reading these is helping me out for real  i just needed some feedback ,0

apparently  you meet people through people    what if you have no people  okay so im well mannered  respectful  i take care of my appearance  allegedly i have a good sense of humour  i make happy acquaintanceships and inside jokes wherever i frequent   all of this i do quite happily and naturally  yet  it isnt enough   i feel like im doing everything right  and yet nobody i meet irl wants to be my friend  its starting to feel like an irl social life is impossible for me  is it because im always alone  do i reek of desperation  do people look at me on my own and think  he must be a real freakshow    do i seem like someone who has it all together  is that the problem  do people see me and think  he probably has a million friends already  like i do with everyone i meet  everyone else seems to have a loving partner and a whole gang of friends they constantly hang out with  and somehow im the only one whos ended up completely and perpetually alone  i just dont get it  what am i doing thats so wrong  ,0
i took classes with a  social coach  and i could talk with random people in the street i always have been very shy and with problems talking with girls so i decided taking classes from a guy that teaches social and seduction skills  i saw an ad in facebook of him and said  i waste my money in booze and games  why not in this   so with some mistrust i went to the first class in a fancy mall in my city  where he gave me a lot of theory that made me think that i was just going to listen the same things that i could hear in youtube videos  but when we were finishing and walking to leave the mall  he just stopped a random girl  talked with her for a while and got her number  i was very impressed  so i kept taking lessons with him for   weeks until he said  come well dressed tomorrow  we will apply the theory   i was so fucking nervous  thinking of excuses for not going the next day  but in the end i had already paid so i went  he saw my nervousness and told me to begin with simple exercises telling girls  nice shoes  have a nice day   cool shirt  and things like that  most girls smiled and said thanks  and i started to lose fear  then i started having more longer conversations   i learned and realized what the coach always said  that absolutely nothing happens if someone rejects you or make you a bad look  you will have very awkward moments but nothing happens  you just keep on with your life  what affects most is the fear in your head and is eliminated with practice   i recommend doing these type of things to overcome shyness maybe not paying to a coach but with a friend to help you to talk to random people ,0
my friend accidentally gave me excellent advice i was driving my friend  lets call her alex  to school today and she was talking about one of our low confidence and awkward friends who we will call jade  jade asked alex   how can i be more confident   alex  also having low confidence a lot of the time  told her  just remember that youre the best person at being you  no one else can be you as good as you can   that was some really good advice and hopefully it helps someone here     x   b  ,0

i always used to eat alone at lunchtime  until one day the cool kids asked me to join them back in high school i was always being pointed at and called the quiet guy  i was just a little different  one day i said thats enough and decided that wanted to change  in college there is always one group that was deemed by everybody as cool  you would know because they were the ones to really confident and outgoing    so i made it my mission to get out of my shell and join them  for the first week i observed to identify which ones were the most approachable members  his name was john  i had learnt that he liked american football and when i saw him in the hall way alone i asked him about the game  he clearly was into football and yet all i did was   listen     i think that alone made him take a liking to me  because from that day on he would pick me first to join his team during the sports classes    after class at lunch time i would go to the canteen as usual at       eat my lunch alone  being the typical quiet invisible guy   but out of nowhere a someone tab me on my shoulder and when i turned around it was john  john decided to asked me to join his table  telling me that his friends wanted to meet me  i couldnt believe what had just happened and i tried very hard not to tear up   i never at alone since      x   b   i think had i not met john i would have still been the quiet kid till this day  although anxiety never full goes away i learnt to control it  its difficult at first but i believe that it is doable for anybody to achieve  six years later i have made it my profession to coach people how to become more confident just like john did     x   b   i hope i could add some value to some of you     i would like to add  you have to define what cool is too you  as long it is a friendship circle that uplifts and support you than go for it  in my case john was cool to me because he was a source of inspiration to come out of my shell  i hope this clarifies what i meant by cool  sorry if i cannot answers everybodies private message but for those who need a  video of a john  https   youtu be ggklkwxaj q       ,0
im sorry to all the people that think thought i was rude because of my lack of social skills  it bothers me tremendously when i feel someone was offended by my quiet behavior  something as small as saying hi to someone or hello can be extra hard for me  so i opt to make eye contact and smile but even then people get offended  i know i cant please everyone and i cant change myself overnight but my intentions are never malicious or to make someone feel that im rude or dont want to communicate with them     does anyone have any tips on how to improve social interactions       or ways they overcame there social awkwardness      ,0

feeling extremely social and happy after years of antisocial life style i did something new and it  unlocked  my social skill  long story   i have a very rough child hood growing up in a wealthy family but in a mostly  not good  school surrounded by poverty  so i got bullied  manipulated and  outcasted  by other kids  i was a good son  always follow the rule  listen to my parents and such but uneducated kids were the only people i can be friend with and my parents never allowed me to make friends with them understandable  so i was very lonely  my trust to people was long gone because of that  funny enough the only time i ever played  the sims  my character is exactly that  follow rules  never make big mistake  never take risk  died lonely   anyhow  at my work  we had a late christmas party and also secret santa  my first one ever   the person that i randomly chose to gift to is a girl that i occasionally made eye contacts with  kinda like her   i have never given and received  a physical gift before in my life and in the secret santa sheet she wrote nothing but  i play soccer   i forgot about it and last minute i bought a mug with roses on the inside and outside and filled it with chocolate  wrapped it like a   years old and literally googled  secret santa message  and wrote a little note sticked it to the gift  anyways  after received the gift she and the others female co workers said that  it is really cute  multiple times for like   minutes  after an hour she then discovered the chocolate inside and said something nice again  i sat on the table next to them overheard it   after hearing this  from me sitting quiet and not talking to  im the center of the party  mode  i started talking to the my co workers that i have never talked to for the   months i worked there  it honestly felt incredible  first time in a long time i dont have to think or analysie the conversation beforehand  i made people interested in me  i approached  basically  strangers    i felt like that girl passively gave me a confident boost and it has been days since then i can feel it positively affecting my life   my gifter gave me more than double the limit of    bucks  i knew that he doesnt have a lot of money  hes an old guy  working minimum wage his whole life  i work with him in the same department  we didnt talk much at work other than a word here and there  all this made me flattered and appreciate people around me way more  before this i was a mess  staying at home thinking nonsense all day  wasting my life away  but now all i want to do is interact with people and make new memories  the best memories that i made last year were from random stranger   right now im thinking of talking to the girl next week at work  without preparation or  scripting  it out before in my head    tl dr  secret santa made me rethink my current situation and realized that somebody does appreciate me and as a result improve my social skill  edit  holy heck  this blew up  thanks everybody and thank you for gold stranger ,0
i found a interesting way to look at my social life i thought  this is a cool new mindset on looking at your social life    i realized that having a social life is like having yourself fresh soil  if you talk and meet more people you re digging flower seeds in the long strip of soil    now  think about meeting or talking to that new person you met  as pouring water on to that flower seed    if you don t talk to that new people much or at all  you won t really have a closer relationship with that person you wanted to    almost like forgetting to water your flower seed and it never gets to become the beautiful flower it wanted to    however  too much of a good thing can be bad  for example  when you water your seed too much  it will drown or rot and not become a flower at all    almost like when you talk to someone soooo much and never really give them space  they will start to ignore you  and might even ditch your friendship with them entirely    once you consistently talk to your new friend  you make a good healthy relationship  just like water a seed enough consistently and becoming a beautiful red rose    having toxic relationships that are ruining your life  is like growing weeds in your new garden    and whenever you make new relationships those are different types of flower seeds  because every friendship and relationship is different  ,0
i wish i could be invisible and follow a socially competent person around for a week  more often than id like i literally dont know how to behave  i guess i know in theory  but thats so arbitrary  i wish i could just firsthand observe what socially competent people do  ,0

i deleted my social media because im left out of social gatherings  i deleted all of my social media and realized how rarely i get invited to group outings  using social media made me unhappy because i saw all the fun things my friends were doing while they left me out  pretty much the only time i get invited out is when a guy wants to attempt to bring me to his bed and we hang out   on    deleting all my social media feels liberating and i have more time for productivity  any one else experience this or similar  ,0
is it possible to have a female best friend without falling in love with them  i know that s kind of a weird question  but i ve always wondered what it feels like for your best friend to be the opposite sex and whether or not  that makes dating others difficult    close friends tend to be more trustful of each other  this can lead to intimacy  and i don t mean intimacy as in sex  i mean stuff like sharing secrets and confessions  stuff like that   here s my main question  how intimate can you be with a friend of the opposite sex while still being platonic  what is the boundary line   also  can having a best friend of the opposite sex effect your ability to have romantic relationships with others   ,0
does anyone else struggle with  friend jealousy   i find it hard to make close friends  and whenever a super close friend of mine becomes closer with someone else i get irrationally jealous  i know its ridiculous because as their friend i should be happy that theyre thriving socially  so how do you get over jealousy you know is unwarranted   ,0
crush said  no  when i asked her out  but later admitted she had a crush on me too but couldn t say  yes  due to her situations  a girl admitted to having a crush on me but said  no  when i asked her out because she s too stressed with what she has going on in life  how do i comprehend this   long story short   i asked out a girl after knowing her for like a  weeks    she said no   i asked for reasons  she said she likes to know people for a while before dating and also because she just got out a bad relationship and is dealing with stressful things like her parent s divorce and school     she said she kinda had a crush on me too  but pushed those feelings to the side     is this just a soft  no    or is this something she just can t deal with and i should ask later     edit  we talked a bit  i mentioned to her that it s very hard moving away from her  and that we need space rn to think things through  she began to cry  and said that many people have left her in life  i didn t know what to say    she mentioned that she doesn t want me to wait for her to tix  her messy life  and that i should see others if there are chances  idk what to think  is this her just saying politely  don t want you  or is considerate  ,0
after a couple years of working on myself  i ve learned one very important thing    i ve been subscribed to this sub for a while and i m noticing a pattern   people   if we say we are socially awkward  then we re gonna be socially awkward   trust me  i did this for years    you are how you define yourself   if you re going to define yourself into a box  then you re going to stay there   quit saying you have anxiety   you don t have it   it has you     i know this may carry a tinge of  wow thanks i m cured    and a couple years ago i d have said the same thing   but one day my wife pointed out that i never want to go places and i always say that  i m socially awkward    she made me realize that i m really not   but when i say it  i go there   so i tried something   i physically stopped saying it   now it didn t happen overnight  but eventually something changed   i stopped feeling limited   after a number of months i couldn t remember why i actually felt  socially awkward    it s because i was putting myself into that box  and there i stayed     trust me  i get it   i still don t like being around large groups of people  especially those i don t know   but i go into that situation now with a different mindset   think about it   the goal isn t  to be social    it s just to have a good time   sometimes i people watch   sometimes i look for a person who also looks like they re also feeling out of place  and exchange a few simple thoughts about the weather or the food or whatever   sometimes i pretend i m not really there as a guest   but as a spy on a mission to collect intel    shout out to burt macklin fbi    the point is to have a good time   and nobody else can tell you how to do it   if you tell yourself the only way to have a successful social interaction is to leave everybody in the room loving you  you re shooting yourself in the foot   they re not that interested in you because most people are just hoping everybody is going to like them    so break out of the box   don t define yourself   just be you and enjoy it   cause it s the only you you ve got    ,0

im not sure how to recover after years of video game addiction and isolation some background  im    years old now  was addicted to video games ever since i was       hours of gaming every day was normal for me  a lot of days id stay home and not go to school just to game more because i thought i wasnt getting enough gaming time  it completely ruined me  i lost pretty much all my social skills  i cant put together a full sentence without screwing it up  i dont engage in a lot of conversations because i have nothing to say due to lack of life experiences  i just got into college and yet again i earned the title that i had back in high school   the quiet dude     why are you so quiet dude   i hate being asked that  im not silent id love to talk non stop but i just have nothing to talk about  im not even shy or have social anxiety   this year i had to stop my addiction because i couldnt take it any more  i sold my gaming pc and im no longer a video game addict  after i did that i realized that i have nothing else to do  im bored all the time  its friday but i dont have any friends to hang out with  i feel really lonely  no one wants to be my friend because im boring and quiet  really  no other reason  lots of people gave me a try and tried to be friends with me but they eventually got annoyed of my quietness and stopped hanging out with me  if i could just not run out of things to talk about id have a million friends  ,0
do you wonder why sometimes people want to be your friend  i feel like i m a boring person and yet there s someone who i consider a friend and they consider me a friend  they message me first from time to time to ask how i am  the one question i ask myself is why they like me as a friend  like i said  i feel like i m a boring person and don t consider myself interesting  of course i m still grateful for their friendship since i don t have many people i consider friends  ,0
ive noticed that in group interactions  the ones who  do best  are the ones who know how to reveal surface level information about themselves without any hesitation  its like theyre hard wired for it  by surface level i mean  a random interesting funny story experience past  random joke  a show song movie actor comedian trend  sharing music pictures videos  a random interesting person that they know in common  surface level compliments  talk about what theyre about to do  pointing things out  or making a random statement  then you just loop those things over and over in different variations in every group interaction  it seems to me like some people think in that mental realm and it just jumps out of their mouth  when i experience something  thats it  it was dope  i analysed a lot about it  but most if it is deep and related to connections i made to myself  my vulnerabilities  life  reality  and those close to me  so if someone asks me   how did you find this movie   in a group  youre not going to go on a big ass analysis of the movie like you can do in a one on one friendship where you can have a discussion  instead  you mention random plot details that made you  shocked   and how  pumped  you are for the  next season broooooo   i dont put effort to remember that because life is too short to remember details that dont contribute to life  i also dont process the details naturally  at a base level  maybe in very small groups you can do a mini analysis but its mostly surface level and it depends on the audience  being vulnerable in groups is a big no no  from what ive experienced at least  along with most most deeper level questions and self revealing   have any of you introverts tried applying this into your group interactions  did you see any changes  or were you still bored because its not your natural state  so it was harder to last long doing it  ,0
everyone hates my    f  personality  even my own mother  please someone just tell me what to do because i have no idea anymore  i    f  am sick and fucking tired of being criticized all the time and having barely any friends because everyone hates my personality  today my own mother said she couldnt find anything likable about me besides being a good student and being pretty  so now i feel completely shitty about myself  i dont care about being those things if i have a shitty personality that no one will ever like  its weird because i know the real me has a great personality but for some reason i am just unable to express it because of my really bad social anxiety and shyness  everything i say or do always comes off the wrong way   i have a hard time opening up to people right away so i come off as really shy and awkward at first  and i also have a resting bitch face so everyone thinks im judging them when thats not the case at all  its actually the opposite  its myself that i judge more than anyone  i have never been in a relationship because most guys see me as pretty but unapproachable or unintelligent or weird   i think the reason for me being unable to act normally and hold normal conversations with people is because as a child i was the complete opposite of how i am now and was always being told to shut up  mostly by teachers  i went to this weird cult like private catholic elementary school  and all the teachers just hated me for some reason  i was the loud  badly behaved child that hated following rules  and being told what to do  and i loved socializing with other kids and talking with my friends  i was constantly being told to behave and shut up and that what i was saying was stupid  and after a while i started to believe it  then i started moving schools  i attended five different schools all in different cities from elementary school to high school   and became extremely shy since i was always the outcast  i had barely any friends  and always longed to fit in with the popular kids but knew it would never happen  i think i am permanently damaged from my awful school experience   now i am in college and dont really have any friends except for my two roommates who are kinda my friends  they have admitted that they hated me at first and thought i was a weird judgmental bitch  but that after they started to get to know me started to really like me  now they say i am the most unique and cool person they have ever met  they just wish i was able to open up to people sooner  everyone who they introduce me to doesnt like me  which annoys them    i dont know what to do about this  it gets me really frustrated because i am reminded everyday by everyone   my family  acquaintances  strangers   that i am  so quiet  and that i need to be more confident and open up  but i seriously have no idea how to achieve this  its like my brain is hard wired to be like this and no matter how hard i try to muster up more courage and stop being so socially awkward  i cant  its like an automatic reaction from my body  i stutter really bad  get really nervous that what i am saying sounds stupid  and generally make people feel really uncomfortable   how do i even start to fix this problem  now that i am stuck inside due to the coronavirus i am afraid that my social skills will get even worse     edit  thank you so much everyone for all the comments  pms  and upvotes  i received an abundance of excellent advice that i am very grateful for  i will try to read every comment  but for now  i am going to go to sleep  and then wake up at   am because i have a calculus quiz due     ,0

cheatsheet  ultimate guide to better small talk in office    simple trick  well folks   bit of a preface here  but i have been known to be a bit of a social butterfly in one sense or another  have no problems in talking with people and usually end up being complemented on  socialness   if thats a word  or being so outgoing etc   but its really overplayed its not that difficult i find   so  i read on here alot  just seeing what sort of issues people have  and if i feel i can truly help i either dm or reply to posts   because otherwise whats the point  no point in commenting for the sake of it   so anyway   colleagues eh  not quite friends  but that weird grey area because you see them couple times a week so need to be civil for the most part  its a strange dynamic anywhere in the world   i have seen it too many times at this stage though  that people allow the power dynamic to overpower them and turn them into unsociable lumps of shit for lack of a better term  and god dammit   you   are better than that   so next time fucking gerry from accounting sticks his nose out of his cave for the first time in   working days to get a coffee   youll be ready to ambush him in a non awkward way   theres nothing complicated about this  you dont change it whether manager or coworker  male or female   its the definition of a one size fits all approach   simply put  split the week into   parts      monday   tuesday     wednesday   friday  during  a  you ask how their weekend was    get up to anything exciting over the weekend     during  b  you ask what their plans are for the weekend    anything exciting planned for the weekend     simple as   now i can hear already people saying  but what if ive seen them twice in a day   we have a back up folks you neednt worry  lets say for arguments sake  we have already ran into lovely  lisa from hr this morning and asked how her weekend was   which got onto a small bit of chit chat   now however shes back again with the flask looking for more coffee at the same time as you   right after lunch that bitch  this is when you hit her with the classic switcheroo  she thinks you have shown your hand  but little does she know youve been counting cards your whole life and have an ace in the sleeve  this is when you drop the next one    hows the rest of the day looking for you                                 or  anything exciting planned this evening    thats it folks  simple as  nothing complicated or sophisticated about the language or techniques used   just good ole fashioned interest  you need to be interested in their plans and them as a person for this to come off as authentic and be sure to use the word exciting   not sure why but maybe because different to just saying  any plans  and getting a  not really  response   people seem more keen to show you they are interesting   exciting   but maybe thats just me   and for christ sake  if you ask handsome harry what hes doing for the weekend and hes out for mimosas with the boys   be sure to ask about them when you see him   people love when you remember stuff  hopefully this has been of interest   use to someone here  ,0
going on my first date tonight   update  tl dr  it went really fucking awesome   so i just got back from my first date  i was a little nervous and awkward at first but i quickly got comfortable  we talked about a bunch of different things while eating and kind of delayed the check since we liked talking to each other  she actually offered to pay separately so that was nice  we make our way toward her car and talk some more  she offers to let me sit inside her car with her  we end up talking for    mins  to an hour  im not sure  time went by really fast  we both bring up intimate topics and i could feel the tension rising  we start getting touchy feely with each other and i could tell shes waiting for me to make a move  i wanted to so bad but chickened out  we talk for about    more mins  and i feel shes giving me another chance so i say  fuck it  and take it  we start making out all passionately with tongue and everything  it was the hottest thing ever  she actually pulls me in closer and we keep going at it  after a while we stop and she says she wasnt planning on kissing me tonight in a playful way  we talk some more  make out again for a little bit and go into a store cause we both had to use the restroom  when she drives me back to my car for goodbye we make out again and both leave    guys  i was someone that hadnt even had my  st kiss before tonight and i was making out with tongue and everything  holy shit i never knew i had this in me  she told me she had fun  i was making her laugh  touching each other and everything  i made some sexual remarks to her and she received them well  yeah  your boys done it  ,0
went clubbing alone  will do it again tl dr  i went out clubbing on my very own and had a very nice time  get out of your comfort zone and you will progress fast af   so yesterday evening  i was at home bored to death  im    m   single for around   months after a   years relationship  socially anxious when alone and also in some sort of early     yo crisis  or something   when i was with my ex  everything socially was easier  she just had to be there and i was fine enough  if the situation was a bit stressful i would look at her intensively  stay close to her and wait for the moment to end  that actually sounds lame now that i write it  but it was the truth back then  now that im single  i have to handle these situations by myself and thats what im working on these days   so back to yesterday evening  bored at home  just had dinner and did nothing exciting during the day  im a big sport addict  i do crossfit     days a week and climbing   days a week  and yesterday was a rest day  its very difficult for me to rest  i dont like playing video games as i did before  im not a huge reader and netflix seemed like  really  again     i wanted to do something else  release some pressure  have fun  i have only a very few friends i keep from a very close circle  they are all in couple  huge sports addict as i am  living a healthy lifestyle  nice  but with the drawback that they were in bed  asleep  at   pm on a saturday night  just my luck   what a bunch of losers  i thought   my    yo crisis  is striking intensively these last months  i try as much as i can to discover new things and do crazy stuff  i tried weed for the first time  had my first fwb  tried it with a dude  traveled alone for the first time  spent an unusual amount of money on clothes  the list goes on     yet  never did i go out solo  i was browsing facebook when i came across an event taking place at a cool conceptual club in town this very night  cool dj from england  cool club  close to my house  i didnt want to stay on my couch again in front of netflix  i was scared to go there and be the lame guy alone with no friends  but i thought that all i had to do was adopting an  alpha mentality  of some sort and it would be alright  to help with anxiety  i smoked a bit of weed before  not getting stoned though  just relaxed  it helps  i choose nice clothes i felt great in and went there   at the club  i felt a bit weird at first  everyone was with at least a friend and im pretty sure i was the only person alone  i usually dont dance if not intoxicated or home alone  but i decided to let myself bounce over the beat  it was sketchy at first  so i decided to drink a few beers to help me go with the flow  again  not intoxicating myself  i had to drive myself back home after   just releasing the tensions  everytime i had the feeling of being judged or acting like a looser i just told myself  thats ok  everythings alright  you look good  you dance ok  the music is great  youre having a cool time in a cool place  you dont need no ones approbation in here     i didnt go all out and start talking to strangers with no reason  nor cold approaching women  even though i wanted to  because being there alone was already quite a challenge   i did talk to a few people however and it went great   some mature woman stepped on my feet and started apologizing  i took her by the shoulders saying it was ok  her friend then joked about my poor choice of white sneakers for a party which i responded with  maybe  but i look great    all casual  all fun  i was dancing next to a cute girl  at some point she was hot and struggled removing her jacket  i proposed to help her which she gladly accepted and thanked me a lot for that  nice exchange  we kept dancing next to eachother for a bit  i wasnt perceived as a weirdo after all  right    i finally came home at about  am  i really enjoyed my time there and might do it again another time  maybe taking the step to actually approach people and especially girls  it was a great experience pushing my limits   my only advice here is  like in the commercial  just do it  nothing will ever happen if you sit on your coach all day finding excuses  challenge yourself  get out of your comfort zone  it works for everything   as a side note though  id not recommend this exercise if youre struggling with your self confidence  work on that first  i had no confidence at all a few years back  before putting myself into sport and building myself a body i like and people would be jealous of  i still have physical insecurities though  everybody has  my teeth are not really straight and i have a huge nose  i compensate that by wearing clothes that highlight my body and make me stand out somehow  you dont have to be ripped  just be confortable enough with your body whatever shape it has  and if its shape is not good for you  work on it  thats what i did   also it might sound counter intuitive  but i know some of you might think about going to a bar instead because you dont like clubs or whatever  but i think clubbing alone is way more easier than going in a bar alone  clubs are more crowded and the darkness is your ally to merge in  bars are in full light  way less people  so you will stand out much more and it might be harder to handle   hope this will help some of you taking the step as reading some similar posts helped me doing it  social skills are things we can work on and progress just like any other skill   just do it  ,0

social drinking for the sober man i happen to work as a bar tender at an upscale joint and this was something that i observed pretty recently and found rather interesting    there was a group of gentlemen who were there for a business event and  naturally  started having a few cocktails  one man came up to the bar and asked that i get him a  virgin jack and coke     for those who don t know the first thing about cocktails  that just means that he wants a alcohol free jack and coke  so    a just a coke    i obliged him and put some coke in a cocktail glass for him  he later explained that he d been sober for a good     years and didn t want to relapse  but also didn t want to seem out of place with the other guys there    so  i suppose that all i m trying to say is if you don t want to drink  but you re with people who expect you to and don t want to explain your situation to them  then just use this little trick  it s pretty simple  but from what i saw  no one ever doubted the gentleman for a second  ,0
as someone who has conquered her fear of social anxiety  these are my   best tips     when you re meeting someone new  don t overshare  it s okay to say something like  i was a little nervous to meet you  but try to avoid the details about how you thought about it for hours until you finally fell asleep from exhaustion the night before  and now you ve only had   hour of sleep  this also applies to aspects in your life  if you have a medical diagnosis that is very prevalent  or a story that you feel like has defined you  it hasn t  you define you  those things should be kept to yourself until someone has earned the right to know them       if you re starting to feel anxiety creep up  find something to touch  a couch  your pants  your steering wheel  describe the sensation of touching the item to yourself   cool  smooth  leathery  moist  ect   find   or more descriptive terms for your item  this will break your concentration and calm the voice inside your head       if you don t know what to talk about when first meeting someone  a go to is to get them to talk about themselves  people love to talk about themselves  don t pry into their lives  but maybe make a comment or ask a question about something they are wearing  avoid sexual comments  or the comments relating to their body in anyway     good luck fellow social skill searchers   edit  this got way more attention than i thought it would  i m so happy many of you can take at least something from my post  but i feel as if i need to add a disclaimer    i m not a therapist  to get to the point where i am today  it took several times in therapy  i end up in a mental hospital at one point several years ago  i ve worked hard to get where i am today mentally  my advice is good but it s not professional advice  nothing can replace the advice of a professional  if you find yourself in a place where your social anxiety or depression has made you think about self harm  please seek professional help   ,0
does anyone else get really bummed out when they spend a whole day at home  i need to go out everyday  even for a walk   i find myself feeling  really  negative  bored  irritated and suffocated if i just spend a whole day at home  and i ve been this way since i was a kid  sometimes i even pick up extra shifts at work to avoid the negativity of being stuck at home  doing nothing   it can be an issue because sometimes i m just not feeling well so don t really want to go out  also i get bored of going for walks around my local area as i ve seen it all before  i try to make plans in advance  eg  on that day  i ll go swimming whatever    i just can t spend a whole day reading  watching netflix  doing school work at home  the thought of it sickens me    anyone else   edit  guys  i m not even an extrovert lol  i m one of the quietest and introverted people  if i m indoors all day with friends  i still get bummed out  when i say going out  i don t necessarily mean with people  i love getting on buses and trains and just exploring random towns alone   edit  in the summer i m more or less fine because i can sit outside and read work  ,0
small step  feeling fucking amazing so today when i was driving in my car i was turning up to some drake  i was very into it  stopped at a red light  and then a car pulls up next to me  i look over as and see a cute girl looking at me  now normally  i would have gotten shy and looked away immediately or pulled my car up a little scared i might embarrass myself  however i was so into the music i didn t give a fuck  i held my ground and smiled at her and she smiled back at me and it felt fucking amazing  she looks away and so do i  i thought that was it  but then her friend pulls up out of nowhere  her seat was reclined  and both start turning up to my music so i also start turning up with them  whole thing lasted a minute or two but it was fucking amazing  i drove the rest of my way home feeling great  mind you  i ve never really interacted with a girl that way my whole life  ive always been shy and scared that im gonna embarrass myself   anyways  just wanted to put this here because i stepped out of my comfort zone and want to encourage y all to do the same  be yourself  don t give a fuck about what others will think  its all psychological  most of the time they don t care  and life too short    this subreddit helped me do so today  and i m still far far away from where i want to be  but small steps like this and one day we ll be where we want  i know this was something that might sound stupid to others who can pull girls all day everyday  but for me this was huge   edit  wow  thank you all for the support  you guys are incredible    ,0
i am    years old and here is my way to start a conversation  does not work on everyone when i sit or stand  next to someone or whatever  i often ask about their shoes or clothes because many people try to look good with nice shoes and clothing  so it is really nice for them if you compliment it  or ask them about it   example  in a gym class  we stand against the wall and there is a girl on my right  i didnt know her   i saw her lebrons and asked    what shoes are those  lebrons   then later i said i was wondering because they looked so nice   it is not wierd creepy it is an wasy way to compliment someone or start a conversation about something both care bout  ,0
jar of fears made me realize i m no longer as shy as i think you know that instagram challenge that s been circling around lately  jar of fears  i did that yesterday and i filled the jar that said  fear of others social anxiety  along with a couple of other fears i had  and posted it   later i got a dm from a friend i know from volunteering  she was confused cause she didn t understand whether the filled jars represent the fears i have  or the ones i don t have  because she couldn t believe that i have social anxiety  she said that i am a great people person  and that she had seen the way i talk to people during  open days  in our organization    to hear that from someone i know is an honest person that i consider as socially intelligent is beyond my wildest dreams   this small comment made me realize how far i d come during the last    years   to give you perspective  as a teenager  i was  extremely  shy  my shyness and social anxiety held me back from having a normal functioning life  i didn t participate in class because i d blush and embarrass myself  i didn t know how to make friends or talk to strangers  a simple restaurant order is a highly stressful situation for me  i d blush when i speak to an aunt or an older sibling  i was very quiet and kept to myself  i was basically a mute   but at the age of    i stumbled upon that organization and i started volunteering in something i m passionate about  animals  i learned so many social skills doing that than i had ever learned my entire life  i d meet all kinds of people and try to educate them about their pets  health and behavior  i interviewed adopters and had to decline people  saying no is a huge challenge for me  still battling that   i was put in horrible situations where i was yelled at and i didn t know how to react   but i still loved every second of it  it was my comfort zone  i was confident in my knowledge about the subject i talked about  i loved hanging out with fellow animal lovers  that s how i met my best and closest friend at the age of     i loved talking about animals  i spoke for hours on end  i even got to experience the pain in my throat for talking too much   now  i think i can say with confidence that i m winning the battle against my shyness  don t get me wrong i m still struggling and doing embarrassing shit on a daily basis  but i understand that i can t completely wipe that out of my personality  and to be honest  i don t want to  my stupid social behavior is a major part of my personality  i never wanted to erase it  i just wanted to be in a point where i m i didn t feel like i m under attack every time someone spoke to me   although i m no longer volunteering as much  i am now able to speak comfortably with strangers  i can do presentations at work and not lose my wits  i am able to say my true opinion to my boss  i can introduce myself  awkwardly  to new colleagues   if you re struggling  find the activity you most love  get in that circle  and have fun   just wanted to share my win  ,0
a tip for being confident when talking to anyone  hey here is a little bit of wisdom that was explained to me that helps with fear and compassion and loneliness    first stop looking at everyone as their own little world  look instead at the biggest picture you can  the world  it sounds silly but stay with me it helps me alot  everyone in this crazy world is still just a part of the world  you  me  your dog whatever  we are all parts of the world  we are all parts of and at the same time made of the same stuff as the world  we are all one thing    like a chair leg  is a part of a chair  its a part yes but it is also the chair just like an arm or a screw that makes up the chair    if you can look at people like that than there is no need for fear  you can really just talk to a reflection of your identity in others    if a social interaction goes wrong thats not something you need to worry about  that is the other persons inability to express compassion towards you and not your problem    now go love the rest of the parts that make this machine run     update   im new to reddit and this post and the comments have been wonderful thank you everyone   ,0
saying no and keeping people on a small distance makes you attractive this applies to almost everyone and every situation or intent   when your being too nice  clinging on to people you can make them feel uncomfortable pretty quickly and they might not be that interested in you  it shows you are dependent on them and your unsecure without them  it shows you dont wanna offend them and you really want them to like you   when you say no sometimes  dont do everything your crush tells you to do like some guys do and negging people from time to time  playfully making fun of them without offending them  when they are an asshole to you can also offend them   it shows your secure  you are independent from them and you are also special and your selecting with whom you are hanging out  this automatically creates attraction for people because they now naturally want you to like them  you are turning the situation around for you   most important though is that you talk to people  if you dont do this they wont notice you and this naturally wont work at all   cheers ,0

i ve noticed how my face lights up when people ask me about something i ve mentioned to them in the past  it makes me feel special that they remember  could this be a social skills life hack  i have major social anxiety  i get tense when approached and i hate conversation  it just always feels like a challenge and i never have the energy to sound interesting so i m quiet and then i m labeled as this mean chick with the resting bitch face who doesn t like to interact  plus most of the time everything is small talk and i despise it  but i keep thinking about this girl i used to work with who was extremely good at remembering details i d tell her  i would notice she d try to make conversations with me all the time  i m sure it was rough for her to do so  but she stuck with it  we d talk here in there at work whenever it got slow enough  i would notice that she would ask me about my dog  which i d instantly be more than happy to talk about  but even more detailed questions like  did you end up getting his medicine on time   or  is he still peeing in the house   from a previous conversation we had a few days back  and then she would ask me about school  but again  more in detail  like  how s anatomy and physiology going    not just  how s school going   it means so much to me for some reason  i could come up with more examples  but you get the gist  it made me feel so important  like she cared  and she wasn t so selfish that she would want to talk about herself all the time  because that s typically how conversations go for me  if i feel stuck and like i can t escape someone  i force myself to ask people questions because people like to talk about themselves  but it s a breath of fresh air when someone is asking me things but with much more meaning  it s almost like the essence of conversation is unraveling to me  or at least there s this game plan i can follow  i m already predispose to be a listener anyways because i rarely talk  thing is i m not the best listener  but it can be key to start listening  remembering details someone says and start getting deeper and avoid these small talk conversations  perhaps i d like it more if it progressed to something more interesting  ,0

i get so incredibly sad when i see groups of people having fun my social skills are ok now  but in the past i was depressed and socially anxious and as an introvert this created a dangerous spiral into isolation and lonliness   ive changed a lot since then  but most of the groups i see on social media or in person too seem to have so much fun and have been friends for a long time  some from my high school who were older and i didnt connect with  i had a group last year but i didnt really like them but the low effort social time was fun    now im in a much better place  i went to therapy and am on medication  but im single and want to socialize but dont have a close knit group  i have one close friend and many acquaintances  there are people i follow on instagram in similar social circles and i  know  who they are from high school but they dont know me   i guess what im trying to say is try to improve your social skills and overcome your social anxiety sooner rather than later  i wish i had fixed things before so i could find my niche  but im just here and sad  ,0
does anyone else feel like their anxiety causes them to be hyper aware and in turn act out exactly what you don t want even more  my social anxiety had gotten very severe in the past couple years and i m finally at a point where i m at least trying to put myself out there again  but now i ve noticed that the things i try to be aware not to do  comes out even more even if it s not my truth  for example  i became aware of the fact that my cousin might not feel comfortable with me being close to her husband so i always tried to keep a wary distance  but now i feel like i might come off even more weirdly because of that  same with my brother in law  as soon as i became aware that it s a relationship that i m supposed to be very careful around to not get  too close   now whenever my husband mentions his name i get very awkward because i am so hyper aware that i should seem calm  another example is when i started to become more aware of the social struggles a black person might go through  like people unnecessarily getting weirded out by seeing a guy in a hoodie  as blm got much attention on social media and i began to read comments of the things they d go through  i thought it was terrible and that i should really try to not come off like that  but because of my anxiety and trying to be so hyper aware i think i might actually make it worse  am i crazy  is something wrong with me  has anyone else felt this  what do i do to stop it  help please    ,0
whenever im into a girl  even if ive barely talked to her  i get too emotionally attached it happens every time  and if i even hear anything about her being  around  other guys it makes me really sad internally and i get a knot in my stomach  i dont say anything to anyone though  i just internalize it all and it feels really bad for me  the first girl i ever had anything with was not a monogamist and it hurt me every time  because i was too attached to her to leave  and now whenever i get into somebody else its like if they dont match how i made them in my head then it hurts me  i know its so stupid because im basically doing it all to myself  and nobody else owes me anything just because i started to like them  i can meditate it off sometimes  but it always comes back in some form  why cant i stop thinking about her  i barely know her and sometimes it takes over my thoughts for the day when i have my own life to live where i shouldnt be worrying about that stuff  ,0
how i learned to  sort of  love small talk  or at least get better at it   small talk sucks  i only like deep conversations    well yeah  everyone likes deep conversations  that s not special   i don t see anyone who would trade one  drunken reminiscing at  am at waffle house with a friend of ten years  for twenty  hey how about this weather   hot enough for ya    while waiting for the damn elevator to come   you don t have to love small talk  it s not my favorite  but listen     the better you are at small talk  the more you ll get to have the deep conversations that you crave     simple as that         as previously mentioned  young whippersnapper me was an  arrogant  awkward d bag  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  pwkg  how i started to find other people more    what a winning combo    at my first  big boy  job out of school  i refused to even say  good morning  to my coworkers because  small talk was a big bucket of bullshit  i m being paid to work not chat   every morning i d usually shrug a response or try to get to my desk through the side door to minimize human contact   for some reason  i always felt alone most places i went   hmm   it wasn t until i was midway through my  meet     people in a month  experiment i called the hundo month that i finally got it    the purpose of small talk is to open the door to starting a relationship   yeah  i know this seems obvious to you naturals out there  but to me this was a   fucking huge life changing revelation    even bigger then when i realized the importance of patting a steak dry before a sear  and that s a big revelation    small talk is dumb  weather is dumb  sports are dumb  tv  movies  and music are all dumb  news is dumb  dumb is dumb  everything is dumb    according to my highly paid research assistants    but that s not the point   the value of small talk is in the  context   not the  content   insisting your small talk has to be brilliant and exciting like it always is in the movies  actually makes your small talk  worse  because you re in your head trying to be maximum clever instead of in the moment reacting to the person in front of you    the purpose of small talk is to         convey your openness to and interest in someone new        invite the other person to start talking in a low risk way        lay the groundwork for more conversation if things go well        give a small sampling of who you are  and most of all            reduce fear     interacting with other people is scary  downright  spooktacular  if you will      a large amount of improving social skills is about reducing uncertainty and fear in      others          small talk is a simple ritual to let people you interact with know  hey i acknowledge that you exist and i will probably not stab you  probably   or at least not soon     that counts for a lot         but back to  small talk sucks  i only like deep conversations   as we established earlier  everything is dumb and boring   see above    think of it this way  small talk is the foreplay to deep connection s   fuckin      the deep emotional conversations  that matter in our lives come from a place of both  openness  and  vulnerability   talking about what really matters in your life to someone else means you might get rejected  made fun of  hurt  or have you waste time pouring your soul out to someone who doesn t  get  it      demanding a deep emotional conversation from the start of a relationship is the emotional equivalent of  nice shoes  wanna fuck   and then calling everyone an asshole bitch when they don t wanna fuck           but hey  i ll be real    as much as getting better at small talk has  seriously  improved my quality of social life  sometimes i just can t fucking be assed to do it  whether i m busy  people d out  on   hours of sleep  or whatever  i m just not going to be bother  i love people  but as an introvert i still need to recharge my social batteries   and that s fine   it s ok to opt out  sometimes  when you re not feeling it  but opting out of small talk completely leaves you at a   massive   disadvantage for finding your new best friend and enjoying life  if you re trying to build a new social circle  it s worth pushing through when you re not in the mood because   that s how you start friendship    plus  the more you practice the easier it ll get    am i a grand champion  double master  ultra guru whatever at making small talk     hell no     but i m better than i was last year  and the year before  and  definitely  better than        hoo boy  that was the year of saying things that keep me awake at night from painfully awkward they were  damn     all i know for sure is that   holy goat balls  getting better at small talk makes your life easier  fun  and friendlier      plus  one completely unexpected side effect of improving my small talk is that i can handle way more socialization before needing to recharge my social batteries   neat         there s no need to beat yourself up if you re not perfect at small talk right out the gate  it might be natural for some people  but sure as hell wasn t for me  i had to fail a  whole  shit ton before i started figuring things out because i didn t really have any role models to learn from   and that s fine   building social skills is a process   all that matters is that you re better than you were last year   that s it   the next time you ve got an opportunity for small talk that you d usually avoid  give it a full hearted try  it might not be perfect  but the more practice you put in  the easier it ll be to build your social circle  ,0
i dont like being called  the quiet one  but i enjoy being quiet  i think theres a certain social stigma about being a quiet person  like  you somehow lack the skillset to interact in social gatherings or its associated with being boring or even snobbish    the thing is  at least in my case  thats not really accurate  yes  i do lack some self confidence and yes  i do suffer from social anxiety from time to time  but i enjoy peaceful interactions  one on one or small group situations instead of being surrounded by twenty people screaming their heads off and talking nonsense    what i dont appreciate  however  is the aforementioned stigma of always being  the quiet one  at parties or family gatherings  ive been labeled as such ever since i was a kid and now that im in my thirties thats not changing anytime soon   so yeah  be social  embark on social adventures and make as many friends as you can  but also embrace your quietness  be proud of being who you are and dont change it to please others  ,0
anybody else just get really happy from a single genuine compliment  i kind of have a nervous moment when i hear them say it  mixed in with some highly happy feeling  maybe it s because i m not used to being complimented but oh my god  whenever someone says something like that in a genuine way i immediately just adore how they re so nice  like someone yesterday told me that i deserve to have friends and i just had the most childish happy feeling that lit up my day  ,0
did something ballsy today  semi asking a girl out   kinda got rejected  still feels good so theres a girl i have a crush on since a week  i saw her today with her group of friends  three other girls   i went to do something else and by the time i came back the girl i had a crush on left  so i did something i usually wouldnt do quickly  i went to the three girls  some i knew kinda well  and said   girls  whats the name of the girl that just left  does she have a boyfriend   they went like  kinda  its complicated  then to  oooh do you like her   to which i replied  i noticed that shes pretty attractive  and they said  aaawh how cute    one of the girls who knows her better said  however  that shes not interested because she usually doesnt fall for guys my type  shes asian and she likes asian guys   that hurt a little bit  to which i just jokingly replied  argh that broke my heart  ive to cry now   the same girl then came up to me and offered her help to see if shes interested  and the girls said that they would keep it a secret  i didnt take her upon her offer yet  since i want to try myself and dont want her to ask for me   it felt pretty good to do such thing  it gives a feeling of being truly alive  what do you guys think though  should i pursue her or not  as the girl said first that shes not interested  but after that said that she would maybe be interested  ,0
i spoke to someone for the first time in   years  change is toughest at the beginning i have waste the last   years hermiting my room due to social anxiety  just over a year ago i decided to make a    month goal to change  today i spoke to someone for the first time in one year    change is diffcult and slow at the beginning but as long you progress you are on the right track   buddy  the video that changed my life by getting me started  https   youtu be uleieo   dc  ,0
so yesterday was the first time i said no when someone asked me to do something  its hard for me to say no  especially to my familly  yesterday i was at my step mother house  we didnt see or heard each other for almost a year even though we live in the same city and she is living with my father obviously  but he is currently abroad  she saw pics on my ig with braided hair and she asked me if i could braid her hair too  sorry for my english  i hope you understand  so ofc i said yes   but it turns out it was easier to do it for yourself  but ive been trying for almost an hour and finally i did it  she went to look at the mirror but she didnt liked it  so she asked if i could do it all over again  my heart started beating fast and i felt a little sick while saying  no  because whenever i refuse to do something  i am afraid someone will get mad at me  but she just said ok  never mind   so i am really proud of myself because people were constantly taking advantage of me only cause i always want to help  but never get anything in return  ,0
i cant deal with the shame of realising im an embarrassingly rude and unsocial person  suicide is on my mind a lot at the moment  ive had a lot of time to reflect on my behaviour with people in real life and ive come to the conclusion my behaviour has unfortunately and un purposefully been embarrassingly rude and bizzare   i cant deal with the shame any longer  and the intrusive thoughts of going back over and over these situations in my head  from ignoring well meaning people  to making accidentally rude comments  im haunted by these intrusive thoughts      and i cant cope  because ive realised deep down i am      the problem  this may seem bizzare to people reading but to me the shame is unbearable  ,0

you all need to stop fucking worrying and over analysing ive been following this group for a while and fuuuck me man  you all need to chill out  i understand some people find life harder than others and some worry too much about how others see them  but overall the majority of all your posts can be answered with either     it doesnt matter what they think  make your own mind up  if they dont like it you dont need them in your life    just fucking say hello and ask them about their day the weather their hobbies what they have planned for the weekend  whatever  if a conversation doesnt ensue then try it on someone else      if you have a crush on someone  see above  it will either work out or it wont  if you really think youre in love and you havent even spoke to them  youre not in love   get on with youre lives and stop being so scared of rejection  there are millions apon millions of people out there  theyre not all going to like you and youre not going to like all of them  you wont know until you talk to them  so stop fannying some and get on with it ,0
how can i be less of a boring person  i overheard one of my coworkers yesterday saying how i am boring when she was talking to another coworker  she said that i am too quiet  i work in a cafe  i work back in the kitchen with two other people  i work with a girl and another boy  the boy is very talkative and has a good personality  the girl and him talk a lot  i will talk and say something when i feel i can add something to the conversation   however  the boy leaves earlier than us  and when it is just us two its quiet  i have social anxiety and i am a very quiet person in general  i do better with group interactions as opposed to   on     i dont really have any hobbies besides youtube and reddit  i dont have a whole lot of interests  my coworkers try to get to know me a little bit  and i dont really have anything to say because i dont really do anything  they ask me what are my hobbies  what kind of movies do i like  etc   it hurt when she said that i was boring  she said that darren  the other coworker  makes the job more enjoyable   this isnt the first time ive been told that i was boring   how can i be a more interesting exciting person  ,0
i often did not stand up for myself because i couldnt bear the stress of conflict  now its a habit  its actually part of my personality now   being a pushover  ive struggled so hard in this life that often times it doesnt seem worth my time to confront people who take small liberties with me  slowly but surely it just became part of who i am and i resent it   edit  as someone else mentioned here  somehow i cant find the comment   i also have some kind of intense physical reaction to confrontation  which is another reason i avoid it  when i do try to confront someone  i often get about as mad as someone whos about to fistfight  i get tense  clench my jaw  and ill be pissed and flustered for perhaps hours after the confrontation  when i speak to the person i wish to confront  i cant keep my cool and find the right words  only pure anger  its like someone trying to play the piano with a hammer  im not sure how relatable this part of it is  but i thought id mention it here since apparently others have this problem also  ,0

how do people have so much to talk about  i feel like i see people all around me talking every day  people who see each other regularly or even daily always have something to say and even text each other after they leave each others side  i genuinely dont understand how anyone can have that much to talk about  any time i find myself in a conversation  i find myself being the only interested party  seriously  im going to need a back brace by the time im    if i keep carrying these conversations so much  eventually  i just cant keep the conversation going because theres no give and take or im just ignored    what am i doing wrong such that i cant have interesting conversations and leave small talk behind  everyone hates small talk but when you give me nothing else  the fuck else am i supposed to do  i am a very social person so please  give me a life line   edit     thank you all for the advice  i think most people agree on what to do but different strategies to do it and im greatful for that  anyone who feels the way i do  there is some great advice in here  i am without a doubt an overpowering personality so it will be difficult so positive vibes and energy is appreciated   edit     oh my everything  so many things  ahhhh  seriously guys  thank you  your words and advice have put me in such a good mood and now i have somewhere to go as a reminder and a pick me up  thank you  all of you   edit      last one i promise  i might be wrong but it seems as though people have the wrong idea about me  i am not an introvert  i am very extroverted  almost dangerously so  for multiple reasons  i just struggle with getting people to conversate with me as much as i need to conversate with them  just wanted to set that straight  ,0
anybody else completely unable to  be themselves  when meeting new people  i don t really know how to explain it  but whenever i m with people i don t know too well  i change personalities even though i don t want to  it happens completely unintentionally  it s like all of a sudden it s impossible to be myself or act like i would when i m with good friends alone  i feel like that s also the reason i sometimes come across as boring  cold or even rude  i just automatically change into this default character that doesn t really engage in the conversation and only responds super short when directly spoken to   anybody else experience it like this  i try really hard to come out of my shell but it seems impossible  i ve been going out more recently and it pains me that so many people won t ever know what kind of a person i really am  and that i m not as boring as everyone always says lol   advice would be great  thank you   if it s somehow relevant i m     f and mostly friends with really extroverted people  edit  by changing personalities i didn t mean adapting to other people and changing behavior depending on your surroundings  i get that that is totally normal  my problem is that it s more like i m just unable to express myself to strangers  almost like i lose my personality and am blocked somehow  ,0

if you initiate a conversation  make sure you lead the conversation  i dont know if this sounds like dumb advice  but i had a massive lightbulb go off today  for the longest time  ive had this problem where any time i started a conversation  it immediately fell flat and got awkward  i realized its because i would initiate the conversation  but then expect the other person to have something to say on the spot  conversations flow so much better if you actually have something in mind when you start it  idk if any if you guys have this problem too  but hopefully it helps someone out  edit  spelling ,0

i figured out some reasons why im bad at making friends    im uncomfortable revealing anything about my personal life or my interests to someone who doesnt know me intimately  this is pretty much anybody outside of my family and a few friends from high school     i have interests that i enjoy and invest myself in  but i often feel too stupid to give more than a surface level understanding of them when somebody asks me to explain  this could be anything relating to pop culture or my more intellectual interests     i feel like i cant relate to other people because i have different life experiences from them     i often feel shut out of conversations because the people im talking to seem to be more interested in having conversations with other people  is it because they think im that boring and awkward   i was just wondering if there was anything that could help me get me out of my shell so i can finally have meaningful conversations with people and feel like i can relate to them   update  wow  thanks for all the upvotes  guys  i didnt think it would blow up this much  i thought maybe only a few tens of people would see it and comment  thanks  ,0
anyone felt that they run out of things to say  even with their family and closest friends  that was the situation i was in  having noticed this  i searched the web for reasons why i am like this  including some subreddits  and i ended up with conclusions such as introversion  depression  other shit   however  i realised that the conclusions that i got werent actually correct  and for those of you who were stuck like me  i hope that what i say makes sense and helps you   i observed that unlike others  i felt like i was unable to truly click with anybody  books about introverts mention having a close friend or a group of close friends that they can truly enjoy talking  with endless things to say  i felt different from others  when around people  i realised that while i am able to hold some conversations  it is mostly me asking questions   answering questions  so obviously  by doing this i really ran out of things to talk about quickly  when i met someone new  once i talked to them to get to know them  i realise that i had no idea what else to talk about  so i really didnt get far in my recent friendships  most of my closest friends are those who have been around me for a long time  and even when i meet my close group of friends  i found myself usually catching up with them  asking questions again  about what they have done recently  then when i am done asking those questions  i found that i have run out of things to say again  the painful part about this is that in school  i couldnt make many friends due to this problem of mine and i really felt lonely  this went on for weeks  months  whenever i thought that i finally overcome this problem of mine  i was proven wrong  i even wrote in a diary using an app  since june  after i made many reasonings and finding out that my situation contradicts what i thought was the problem  i think that i finally  diagonsed  my situation  which is what i am writing about today  i asked a close friend of mine for advice yesterday and he told me to  just say whatever that comes to my mind  unless you know it is obviously going to offend someone   i found this really helpful and i had a really great time after that     lastly  i have some advice to offer  having been through this shit  this advice isnt exclusive to my situation and i hope it helps you out       dont judge people too quickly  especially if you are still working on your social skills  what you perceive of people may not be accurate  if you judge too much then you may be missing out on conversations and making great friends      dont filter yourself too much  just say whatever is on your mind  unless it is really offensive or something  it could be anything  from the surroundings  just anything   edit  i thought of some things more to share    this is more related for me and people in my situation      as someone who rarely has anything to say  you may find yourself mostly listening in to others in a group conversation and occasionally joining  i suggest making the effort to start more conversations  you could do it when you are walk in a group and start with talking to someone  maybe what you are talking about might interest others and others will join you instead      in your free time  you could spend some time building up your interests  you could start with listening to more music  music is a great way to bond with people too when you have similar tastes  also dont be afraid to try new things and hobbies  you may discover that it is really fun  you may discover a new passion in you  ,0
i know nobody cares but i had a good hour conversation with a hot girl for the first time without stuttering or it being awkward  what i learned from it    a hot girl  is human too so just keep it cool and act like you would with any other normal person   its okay to have breaks or pauses in between     be confident and dont look desperate  ,0
i haven t touched any human being in the past   months  well  if you are thinking this is only because of covid and lockdown  then sorry to say that you are wrong   the only time i touch or get touched by humans is in the crowded bus places   i am an international student  came to the usa about   years ago  in my home country  i was confirmable with my solitude   i e  few friends  and loving family relatives  never  experienced any feelings of  left out    in my life   anyhow  i came here for higher studies and very soon realized that i was not ready to climb such a gigantic mountain of loneliness in the usa   i tried to make few friends in university which includes people from different countries  i felt relieved  but it was all temporary  i   couldn t find any genuine true connection with anyone   from outside  i was looking content  had a happy smile on my face in my lab  parties  etc   but  failed to push the conversations beyond    how are you    i am fine  and all those fake expressions   in my family  i am famously known as a very funny  humorous boy who likes to talk and hear so much about anything  let it be politics  philosophy    spirituality  music  movies  life  technology  sports  etc  anything   as a talkative person  i used to get my dopamine hits after having meaningful conversations with someone or listening to any deep podcasts   interviews on youtube   however    currently  i am trying to introspect my decision of coming here and whether i should continue staying here after finishing my studies   there were days in my life  in the usa  when i used to call random customer cares numbers just to have any conversations with someone apart from my family   i feel left out in this world  recently  my sister said   sometimes you behave like a joker    joaquin phoenix    i agree    put on a happy face    i tried various social apps such as meetup  volunteering at various  ngos   tinder  etc  i never succeeded in making any long term connections with anyone  i have already wasted so much money  time  and self esteem in online dating and in end realized that this thing  where you will be judged by looks first and then four five lines of an intro   and will have to impress random people without having any deep thoughtful conversations  is indeed not going to work for me   when it comes to friends  every time  i am the one who will text call first    invite for dinner at home  ask about movies  concerts  etc   i  had few friends     whom i used to call  ask about their studies every time  prepared a good dinner for them  i have stopped calling them about three years ago  none called or texted back  hmm   whenever it comes to birthdays of some of my friends and lab mates  i will not only call text them but also without fail  i have given various gifts such as books  flowerpots  scarfs  singing bowl  earbuds  etc  to my so called friends   with no surprise  the same people didn t even wish me or care about me   of course  no one asked me to buy anything  i was just trying to make someone happy   someone rightly said    world doesn t  owe you anything   lesson learned   no expectations  no disappointments    my family  in my motherland  constantly worries about me and asks me to hang out with friends  live in a practical world   socialize in human beings otherwise  i will die alone   i   am tired of telling them that i have now given up on the people  i   don t have any energy  optimism  and hope to engage in any social activities now   for the past two years  i am passionately trying to change my behavior  i am doing daily heavy exercises  meditations  the following stoicism passionately  this has definitely improved my mental health with significantly lower negativity and cynicism   also  watching lots of stand up comedy and good shows are kind of helping me escape the bitterness in the world   however  i still have that void in my mind when it comes to helping or loving unconditionally anyone   now   i am so comfortable in my own space  that i am afraid of getting   married to someone  yes  relatives have already started asking    a few months ago  i told my family that i want to join a monastery in the future  without any surprise  i was heavily lectured on the  blueprint of this life i e  learn earn marry kids do their schoolings    marriages play with

why ford is bullshit   why hefe is way better    ford  familyoccupationrecreationdreams     i never understood why people always teach that ford is a good idea when you wanna make friends   small talk with someone  especially someone who is socially anxious or depressed  why do i think that    because it is personal   awkward    ford should be the last thing you use when you talk to someone  the only way i see ford not being awkward is if you are very very very close  it never made sense to me to go with ford  especially if you meet someone for the first time   like   really  youre gonna ask someone about their family  their occupation   their dreams   i mean  recreation is the only good thing on the list but as for the rest   are you c r a z y    what if they hate their family  what if they are so depressed they dont work  and who tf are you for them to share their dreams with you  you dunno their lives   what are your dreams   lmao  shut up karen      people dont know tf my dreams are  i didnt even say it to my own dad   even if it somehow works  what are you supposed to say   what do you do     i do x    oh cool i do y    nice  me too thanks            it is hard to proceed with the info you get   it sounds too interview y   if it fails  it is tense and simply does not work on most people  even if it does  what about you  they are prolly gonna ask you back and you  being socially weird  depressed  anxious cant flex as hard and then things get uncomfortable and just has very very big chance to go south   thus is way too risky    but  oddfix  what do i do  ford is super convenient and its better than awkward silence  can i use something better  safer   more efficient    well  im glad i asked myself that  that is a very good question  me  since ford is out of the picture because it looks like a prehistoric system that used to work in the   s just like most self help books from that age that people recommend  let me introduce you to a much better system that can be applied to everyone ever      hefe  hobbiesentertainmentfoodenvironment     you literally cannot go wrong with hefe  everyone has hobbies  everyone likes music  everyone watches movies   tv shows   everyone eats food  you can  quite literally  make friends just sharing stuff you like   maybe finding common ground  wanna show them your artistic side  guess all that crippling depression   introverted house sitting finally paid off  and  hey  if there is a movie showing or a concert happening  guess what  now you have a hobby buddy so you can watch spiderman turn into dust for the second time and cry   for the second time   all of the four are very vague   can be applied to lots of things  family only applies to one thing  you only have one family  occupation applies to one thing   your boring stupid job that pays the shitty bills you dont even wanna think about  if you ask someone what their hobby is  it can be drawing  singing  exercising  dancing   whatever  entertainment  video games  music  movies  and those things all have their subcategories  some people like rap  rock  pop etc   food is another thing  ask them about food they like  maybe you can share recipes or try to make food together or go to a place that has food you like  maybe you can make a deal they try your food if you try theirs  if anything else fails    talk about environment  the stuff surrounding you  the country you live in  give people compliments on their looks  hell  talk about weather if you have to   and guess what    everyone is open to talk about hefe    unlike ford  its not stressful to talk about hobbies   food  low risk  nice reward  what more could you ask for    go out there and be a boss hefe      hefe  lvl     boss    ford  lvl      minion       thats how social skills works     ,0
people forget that listening is also a social skill  i have noticed when people listen they rarely do it with the intention to understand but with the intention to respond  its very hard to connect that way   i found that by asking questions and masking the emotions of the speaker is one way you can  display good listening skills   https   youtu be cdwpf r mhs  ,0

people who blame you for being too sensitive how do you respond to a toxic person who is making fun of you  and when you confront them about it  they say they were joking and tell you to chill out    i want to learn how to create boundaries with some negative  possibly toxic  people in my life  the thing is whenever i start to call them out when they are going to far  they tell me im being too serious  or that i need to chill out relax  or call me a little bi ch  or make fun of me even more in front of everyone saying stuff like  aww did i hurt your little feelings   then laugh    some will know it gets in my nerves and they will tone it down for a little while but theyll go right back to it soon enough   tl dr how to create boundaries with toxic people who say youre being too sensitive ,0

does anyone else get mental blanks when spoken to  i ve noticed the biggest problem with my social skills is that my mind goes blank when someone i don t know well talks to me  for example a coworker asked me what i got up to on my break and absolutely nothing came to mind  so i just said  not much what about you   i d actually done a few things i could have mentioned to build up a conversation but i only thought about it after this interaction   this happens to me in so many other instances and it s so incredibly frustrating   does anyone know how to get over it  because it always happens without warning and i always tell myself i ll do better next time but completely forget  edit  thanks for all the replies guys  your support has truly helped and made me feel less alone in this      ,0
i feel inferior to pepole that have friends i cant help it  i know that they arent  better  but it still feels like it  they have made a lot of expiriences i didnt and if something akward happens they can tell their friends about it  and they have their back while i cant tell anyone  also they know how to behave in social situations and i dont   its hard for me to put the thought into words but maybe someone can relate  ,0
this subreddit is really cute    its comforting knowing that so many other people have similar experiences in social settings       im finding myself developing compassion for guys that i previously would have labeled creepy  i can see that they dont mean to be and it can be really hard for someone with social anxiety to put themselves out there in a confident manner  which is why they come across as creepy      i just think its really good to be open and vulnerable about lacking social skills because by its very nature it is difficult to talk about and i struggled for a long time feeling like it was only me  now i see that so many people go through this but none of us knew how to talk about it   edit  it has been brought to my attention that my use of the word  cute  may feel condescending to some  it was not my intention to offend  can we sub the word  cute  for  say   lovely   or  nice   gosh language is tricky  ,0

you can develop your social skills  it s just takes time  i remember when i first started trying to be more social and make friends and how i use to get headaches after a few conversation  i d be exhausted all the time and even worse i d just be too tired to finish the night from so much social interaction   i tried all of the things googling conversation topics and questions  suits  different styles  social events and so on which were cool for a bit  and i got better but eventually since it wasn t actually me i dropped all of that stuff   now what did happen was i started to dress more comfortably for me  after trying a bunch of stuff i didn t like  i found a lot things i did like  i just became more relaxed as i was now more comfortable with myself as a whole  started going to the places and merging with crowds i liked  this after months of going anywhere and everywhere to meet people  a bit of the things i tried stuck with me actually    eventually i was able to go anywhere and everywhere alone and not be nervous  the headaches had since vanished  while i did vastly improved my socials skills i think the best part of it all was becoming a better version of my self and with so many different experiences behind me from when i was screwing up i learned to have more fun   making friends and connecting or building rapport takes times  now while you do have to push yourself and initiate most of the time  just recognize these friendships and relationships don t have to happen right away    most importantly you have to connect with yourself first  sometimes that means leaving the version of yourself you re not happy with behind for a bit only to come back and realize how awesome you are   note  totally up for answering questions if you need  leave them below if you re comfortable  ,0
i feel so alone in college i keep comparing myself to other people at my college and it seems like everyone is more outgoing and having more fun  granted  i am a little more introverted and don t party smoke drink  i just wish i had a good group of  friends i could socialize with and have fun  have amazing memories  i feel like my first two years at college have been so boring and all i ve been feeling is depressed  lonely  and hateful towards myself  i blame myself for not being a  party animal  but instead being a  grandma  as some people may call it  i compare myself to many sorority girls and greek members in general  they all have their cliques and groups and parties  they all have fun and seem to have found their  lifelong friends     i wish i had that  i even joined a sorority but it just wasn t for me  so at least i can say i ve tried it  but yeah  i don t know what to do  my college experience has been such shit i feel like a total loser  i worry i have this image of a  goody two shoes    i feel so bland  i started feeling this way because i went to the instagram accounts of a few sorority girls and their college lives seems so fun and eventful  they re so beautiful  skinny  and have a social life  they all seem to be well liked and i just tend to compare and feel like i am destined to be a nobody   edit  hi everyone   wow i didn t expect this to blow up   thanks so much for taking the time to read my entire post and responding  i appreciate it so much  and wow thank you to the person who gave me a gold award   i ll try to respond to all the comments  thank you so much again   ,0
you didn t miss any lessons on being a human being  whoever you are  you re okay  all of you  it s okay to be you with everything that that entails  don t fight your truth  you re sad  scared  anxious sometimes  that s all okay  what s not okay is living life not doing the things you want because you re living for what other people think of you  you re not even trying to do the things that speak to you because you re not living in your truth  you re afraid of judgement  unless you put on the performance of a life time  you re always self pitying and feeling like you failed when you talk to people   it s not about how you feel  it s about what you do and why you did it  and when it comes to social anxiety  it s not about how well you did it  but just that you did it when you knew it was what you truly wanted to do  why do you want to talk to that person  because you re lonely  because you want to improve your social skills  how about just because you think they are interesting  how about because you want to pick their brain and get to know someone while they get to know you  what do you have to fear if you stumble over your words or can t look them in the eye  what is your intention  who cares if you don t perform spectacularly  did you express and act in accordance to your truth regardless of your fears and anxieties  did you ask the questions you were interested in and the things that fascinated you about them  did you share yourself without expectations  these are the things that matter  do and know why you do and know that it s okay to be every part of you so long as you truly live your truth  you didn t miss any lessons on being a human being  whoever you are  you re okay  all of you  ,0

if you give too much of yourself to people they start taking it and you for granted  imagine if you could snap your fingers and here comes the money     fame would become boring really fast    if you give too much attention to someone like way more than they give to you then there will come a point where talking to you isn t a highlight of their day     hey it s mike      oh it s mike   there will come a point where talking to you is more of a chore  or something that has become more of a  routine  than a pleasure or a privilege    same thing if you re helping someone out or giving your time to that person if you show them that you re always easily available at a certain point they will start to think of you as  that guy who helps me with stuff  rather than a friend they will put much more value on what you can bring to them if they show you they genuinely care about you for reasons other than the help you re bringing them then good if you show them that you re not always available and not scared to say no but they re still around good    and last but probably not least try to be reciprocal with people   of course it doesn t mean that you always have to  expect things in return from people of course it doesn t mean you can t help people just because you care about them and that s it but it means you gotta stay on your guards some people are naturally more caring more kind hearted than some people so are willing to give more naturally and that s okay   but if you re always and quickly as possible  here for someone replying to their messages as soon as they re sent but they leave you on read most of the time  but when it s your turn to ask something from that person and you notice it s way harder for that person to be there when you need her even if it s only because you want some of their  attention  but you gotta blow up the moon to get their attention then don t be afraid to either stop giving or at least tone it down a little bit doesn t always matter if they re more busy or not because it s still about giving your time to someone take more time to reply to their messages make yourself intentionally more busy but don t be their b tch i m apologize i truly had to say it   a relationship where you give     and they give          is never healthy it just sucks   it doesn t always have to be       but it certainly doesn t have to be a relationship where you give way more of yourself than they do    so what you gotta remember from this post is   that you shouldn t always give too much of your time to people especially if they don t give as much as you do which is okay if you think that person s worth it once again but you don t have to some people will take advantage of you intentionally and unintentionally   get a life seriously  i m not saying this to be disrespectful  but focus on yourself learn how to respect and treat yourself make yourself a busy person anytime you want   and don t be afraid to become a little bit more selfish you won t go to hell from it so chill out and watch out who you re here for   don t ever feel like you need to do something for people in order for them to like you ever  ,0
im dating my crush   there is one simple trick  and its not flirting  edit  we have been together for    months as of now  now  keep in mind  my crush was the one to ask me out  i didnt trick them into it  really flirt too much  or do somethinv psychological to make them like me  this will sound cliché  but part of it is to be yourself  hear me out before you click off  when i was around my crush  obviously they didnt  and still dont  know everything about me  they dont necessarily need to  just live as yourself unapologetically  theyll slowly start to notice little things about you  stick to your opinions  dont change them just for someone else  and dont lie about little things to seem  cool  or better than you may be  laugh when you think things are actually funny  not just at their jokes  tease them in a friendly way  maybe become friends with them  and if not  ask them out  i know its a lot of anxiety asking someone out  hell  even becoming friends with someone  but just remember  the worst thing that will happen is they say no  and youll then still have an amazing person in your life   my advice is to make them feel comfortable around you  be yourself  and work on self love  remembering things like  if they dont respond to a text  it doesnt automatically mean they hate you    dont wait around for love to find you  find love first  whether its platonic or romantic  good luck out there  ,0

 i don t care how fucking depressed you are  there is no excuse to treat me like this  how am i supposed to react to this  up to the months before quarantine and because of quarantine  my mental health has gone to shit  i truthfully have cut some people off and just emotionally distanced myself from people because i just can t express how i feel  the person that said this to me i didn t think i was treating them poorly  i ve just been keeping to myself  this person shows a little bit of  concern for my mental health but asks the wrong questions  making me sound bad and themselves the victim  whenever i talk to them i end up feeling worse than before    because of that i ve tried to distance myself from them because they emit nothing but negative energy  normally i can deal with it but because of the mental rut i m in i just can t handle it    truthfully i don t know what to do or how to even react to this  edit    i didn t come here looking for relationship advice but he was my boyfriend  after trying to explain how i felt and how i thought i should be treated he wouldn t agree to it  saying that i was childish and sheltered from the world and that i needed him   we broke up so thank you for those who tried to help  ,0
remember to take your earphones out every once in a while  i ve recently moved countries for university and even as an extrovert i ve found it quite hard to make friends  until recently i thought i m not very likeable or something but my flatmate has told me something that s opened my eyes a bit  she said  i wanted to talk to you but since i noticed you had earphones in i didn t want to bother you    i have anxiety so i find it really comforting and safe when i just listen to music instead of listening to all the noise  but since my flatmate told me this  i ve been keeping my earphones in my pocket more and to my surprise  people have approached me more  i made more friends and reached out to people way more than i thought i would  even if it was just telling a stranger that they need to do x instead of y    my point is  people actually notice you and act accordingly  if someone had earphones in you wouldn t want to bother them either probably  make sure you make yourself approchable   edit  removed sex and age as i was informed it s not relevant  sorry for that   edit   as someone in the comments said  smile at people too  good way of making yourself look more approachable    ,0

    lessons  having hobbies and things you re excited about in life makes having interesting things to say easier  don t have a hobby  try a local class in your city once and see if you like it  do this every month   bonus  youll meet new people  a while back i posted this   today i turn     here are    lessons i ve learned about being better with people  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments czah t today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned    r socialskills liked it      i liked this so much ive already started to refer to this as  jeffs    laws of unspoken communications  in my head  lol     u roastedmarshmellow      past posts    just  go to this post and click on any number       https   www reddit com r socialskills comments czah t today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned   to go to that number s in depth post                               our lesson for today         having hobbies and things you re excited about in life makes having interesting things to say easier  don t have a hobby  try a local class in your city once and see if you like it  do this every month   bonus  youll meet new people                                 i see a few posts a week in this sub with some version of   how can i become more interesting     it s a good question    most of us know to be interesting we should  be interested  in others   ask good questions  make good observations  etc    but when it s our turn to share something about ourselves  it can be really hard to come up with something on the fly   let s fix that   having hobbies and things you re excited about in life makes having interesting things to say   x easier   one of the best thing you can do for your social skills is to put yourself in social situations so you can practice and improve   but here s the thing a lot of people miss  put yourself in the  right  social situations  for you     if you love parties  go to parties    if you love cooking  go to a cooking class    if you love art  go to a meetup at an art gallery   don t go places that aren t a natural fit for you  if you don t like loud events with a lot of noise skip them   what i tell my clients    write down   things that you re either already interested in or would like to learn about     if you live in a somewhat large city       k   less if it s a college town  chances are high that there are events  meetups  and classes related to your interests   the great thing here is that you and the other people at the class or meetup are already interested in the same thing  you already have a built in topic to talk about with them   most people get set in their routine  work  home  school  weekend  repeat   and that s great  i love my routines too  but it s fine to mix it up a little  too     action step   once per month  find an event in your area that seems fun and interesting  you ll shake up your routine  and you ll have something interesting to share after the event   ex  at work  school  with friends   here are some past    lessons posts that will help     being curious about others   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dnvkdc today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned      first impressions start before you open your mouth   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dqkyst    lessons ive learned about being better with      telling engaging stories   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments ee lt     lessons prep a quick summarystory from your      talking about the event later     if you ve attended an event  it s important to talk about it in a way that s interesting   could be with coworkers  classmates  or friends   consider these two variations on the same thing       i went to an art exhibit downtown  it was fun       i went to this amazing art exhibit where an artist gathered sea plastic from around the world and created works of art  i saw a shark made out of pvc pipe  plastic bottles  and shoe inserts    good things to keep in mind here  show  don t tell  use visual language to paint a picture in your audience s mind    also  pump up your delivery energy by       a less interesting story  delivered with  higher  energy will be more captivating than a more interesting story  delivered with low energy   if you re enthusiastic about it  the other person may get excited and want to join you for your next adventure   this builds a virtuous cycle   go to event you re interested in    meet people there    talk about the event later    invite someone to a future event    go to event you re interested in     action steps summary       write down   things that you re either already interested in or would like to learn about  this will make searching for events that you ll enjoy much easier    once per month  go to an event in your area that seems fun and interesting   feel free to dial this up if you want to                                  in the comments      what is one interest you have that you could try finding events for                                also     if you re out at these meetup and events  being in a group conversation is unavoidable    something i see a lot with people who are trying to improve their social skills is needing help navigating group conversations   i created this audio guide to join   enjoy group conversations you might check out  https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html   in this audio guide youll learn    genuinely connect with anyone about any topic   how to jump into a conversation that has no opening   how to get out of your head and stay present in group conversations    and more  word for word scripts  body language while joining a group  etc    enjoy   https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html  ,0
a bit of unwanted advice  your social interactions are probably worse inside your own head than it actually is  this is something i learned in my teens  most of the time its you that makes you suffer the most  you would be suprised by how many people are too preoccupied on how they think of themselves that they dont really care about you    and thats okay   its not that you never put your best foot forward  its just okay to slip every now and then ,0

i get it now  not as a theory  but ive finally internalised it  you really cant control anything beyond yourself  peoples opinions  attraction  the past  the outcome etc  all you can do is just exist  enjoy the process  accept the people who vibe with the real you   then have a base line empathy  thats it  thats what it means to be yourself  just fucking exist  yeah  improve yourself  shed your insecurities  and work smart so you can exist from an angle of wisdom and value  but that comes from life experience  at the end of the day  all you can do is be what youve always been  if people dont like that  fuck em  show a base line level of empathy  but you dont need to be overly nice or try hard to gain their favour  a half smile and reciprocating respect is enough  the rest are the ones that will join in on your reality and lift you up or do whatever else youre looking for from their presence    and it might sound fucked  but i understand tribalism a lot better now  whether youre white  black  latino  asian  arab or anything else in between or outside of that  the people with similar pasts will naturally gravitate towards you  thats just how it is  so yes  you will likely have more friends of the same colour  if you were white and lived in japan  then that would be the exception to the rule  another example of similar pasts is two people who had a tough upbringing  two people raised with the same religion  or who both left it  some sort of strong commonality  theres also other aspects  maturity level  wants  needs etc  you cant control any of those things in someone else  they sort of just happen  if the strong commonality  or want need outweighs the differences  that person will be more naturally aligned to who you are    you can fake that you can meet someones wants needs or lie about a commonality but it will kill you from inside  you will learn nothing  and you would have wasted the limited time that you have in your life towards the purpose youre most suited for    ,0
success  after   years  the head chef at my work finally likes me    not sure if this belongs here  as i don t have much of a problem with social skills  or maybe i won t admit it haha   but the head chef  who is probably in his late   s  and i   f  have rarely  if ever  bonded through the years of working there as a server  as far as i know  he doesn t like any other employees besides other kitchen staff and one of our managers  everyone complains about him  but i treat him as i would anyone else  saying hello and asking about his day  but he would treat it as though i were bothering him  i have tried many times over the years to change this  but no matter how much i ve tried  he wouldn t budge  because i was discouraged over time  i would keep our interactions brief  however  a few days ago  i made a lighthearted joke with him and he smiled  two days ago  i was having a really sad night off and i felt inspired to make him a card and write about how much i appreciated him and his work and how i hoped that we could be friends  i gave it to him yesterday and when i came in to work today  he came up to me and told me how nice my card was with a smile  lesson learned  make more of an effort with difficult people and sometimes difficult people just really don t feel appreciated    ,0
proud of myself for having self respect and courage today   i work in the restaurant industry and work many doubles and am a very hard good worker  i ve always had sunday monday off since i started this job and yesterday my boss informed me  without reason  that i would have to start working mondays and that i could have thursdays off instead   well let me tell you that in my state of health and mind right now  having those two days off in a row really help me to keep myself together and stay sane    i gave in yesterday and said it was okay  i went home and felt really bad about myself and felt like i had no value at my job whatsoever    today i listened to some feel good music and marched  my little hiney in and said to the manager that  although we had briefly spoke about my schedule change the day before as i was walking out the door  i unfortunately wasn t going to be able to accommodate that change     he actually sat there for a second and seemed surprised i said anything  and then told me that he would work around it     i feel very proud for standing up for myself and explaining that i have worth to this company and didn t see a reason why my day off needed to be taken away  he was very respectful and seemed impressed by my notion    so much has been going negatively in my life and i feel like it has a lot to do with my lack of self respect and let me tell you  if you feel like you feel slighted or wronged by someone s actions or what they say  you have every right to stand up for yourself  i question myself a lot whenever i feel mistreated and i always try to explain myself out of having to create a future confrontation  but it s well worth it      so go out there and do what you gotta do  because no one will look out more for you than yourself   edit  thank you for the kind words from everyone it has reinforced my ever dying confidence in myself haha  i hope that i have really inspired a lot of others to do the same    also thanks for the silvers and the coin gift  my first reddit awards ever     ,0

something happened recently that made me really sad  i thought id share it with you  what i heard shocked me  im a socially awkward guy  not many friends  bad family history with an abusive mother  i was also sick for years that really made my social life go down the gutter  im interested in meeting new people  i knew this guy on instagram through a mutual friend who was trying to be a model  he had like   k followers  he made music videos and tik tok stuff  i often messaged him saying i liked his stuff  about   weeks ago i sent him a message that i really liked that he wanted to grow as a person and that im trying to do the same  i said to him that we should discuss ideas sometime  he said why not  and said we should  meet for lunch next weekend  when the day came i was ready and sent him a message asking when hes coming  he said he was out of city and couldnt come  i was ok with that  if was not like he had a obligation to come  i said it was cool and went back to my stuff  well a few days ago i get a message from him saying theres a instagram event happening in the city and we should meet there  i was happy  i agreed  i texted him to tell me the location and timing  he didnt reply for a day and on the next day sent me the name of the event  not the location or even the time   i said i need more details but he didnt reply  i searched up the event on facebook and got the location and timing  on the day of the event i called him to check if everything was alright  he said i should come at  pm    the instagram even started at  pm and i went there in my car  i forgot my wallet at home but thought it wouldnt matter because that guy told me it was free  i parked my car and went to entrance and saw people buying tickets  i asked them how much was the ticket and it was very expensive  i was a little angry at the guy for not mentioning it  i called him and said there was a ticket  he said he didnt know  i didnt want to ruin my saturday so i went back home  ate some  leftover pizza  got my wallet and went back there  before i bought the tickets i asked the ticket guy if people invited by guests are allowed free entry  he said yes but those inside have to receive them at the gate   after finding this out  i tried calling him but he wouldnt pick up  i waited    minutes outside the entrance  after    minutes i get a call from him  i told him if he came to the entrance to receive me i wouldnt have to pay the expensive ticket   hell i expected him to meet me at the gate when i first arrived because he was the one who invited me   he was polite when i was on the call but then when the call ended he forgot to hang up  i didnt know what was happening at first but then i heard him say to his friends  motherfucker is here  that loser from instagram who messaged me  he wants me to come to the entrance to pick him him  such a pathetic loser      that really hurt me inside  i felt sick  i came all this way for this person who i thought was polite and respected me  who wanted to share ideas about growing   i cut the call from my end  turned around  started my car and went home  i felt angry  hurt and sad  i got a few calls from him afterwards and texts saying where was i  i blocked his number and his instagram because i didnt want to talk to someone like him again   i genuinely tried reaching out to someone and this is what happened  anyways that was my experience  hope you didnt waste your time reading all of this   edit   i know people come here for information and want to stay anonymous but after reading all your comments i want friends like you   ,0
encouragement from someone who made it through i was    when i finally got pissed off at myself enough to say  fuck this  im not going to be socially awkward and inept for the rest of my life  socially retarded me is not me  its me analyzing me  and its fucking me up   i changed my major to communication  which is not a well regarded degree but one that requires you to work in groups and give a lot of presentations in class  and collected as many give a fucks as i could into a bag and threw it in a pond     x   b   my life did not change dramatically right away  but saying  no  to the fear and bullshit that was causing me to hide my true self from the world was enough to start the fire  i stood up to the bully of fear  and the bully backed down  bullying is always based on insecurity anyway  so when you finally show a bully that youve got the fire  they take their insecurity elsewhere   no  became my mantra  when the fear would try to creep back in no was my weapon  fear still got the best of me once in awhile but i learned to enjoy the daily battle as it was a kind of psychological swordplay  i remember the first time i went for the kill  i was about to sit down to eat lunch alone on campus when i saw two beautiful girls on the other side of the room with an open seat across from them  i knew what i had to do  and the adrenaline hit me so hard that my kidneys hurt  adrenal glands are on top of the kidneys   but i digress   i walked over there and said  i was going to eat lunch alone but im sure it would be much better here with you two   and i sat down  i didnt ask permission  i just smiled and asked what they were up to as if this were a perfectly normal thing for me to do  nevermind my exploding kidneys  we had a nice conversation and some laughs  and i spilled my yogurt  i casually dismissed myself after about    mins and walked away feeling like id just been baptized  victory  fuck fear this was my day  i even received a little icing on the cake when one of the girls  the better looking one if i may say so  made it a point to look me up online and tell me  that was awesome how you just came up and sat with us      x   b   this wasnt mere validation for my ego  it was a lesson that boldness reaps rewards  and that people enjoy the company of bold people  that second part is important  ill come back to it in a minute  to keep this post somewhat short i just want you all to know that i was a kid from a small town of less than       who always felt uncomfortable around people  but who learned how to tell fear to fuck off  i now have a great network of friends here in my home city and around the world  ive had amazing girlfriends  i currently have the best girlfriend ever  who i met because i walked up and said  hi   i just banked my first six figure year in my career because i am especially fearless when it comes to work  it is just work and you should take risks  boldness my friends  be bold  if you make a mistake  make it because you were too bold  there is respect and honor in that     x   b   most importantly  social skill is not something you do  its not something you acquire  its not even about you  social skill is an act of giving  make people around you feel good  talk to them  connect  ask about their lives  ask about their ideas  listen  encourage  make them feel cool by being cool  be cool by being relaxed  say no to fear  say fuck you to fear  social skill is already a part of you  remove the layers of fear and bullshit that are covering it up     x   b   whatever brought you to this sub  that thing you believe you are lacking  whether its love or humor or just common decency  that is what you have to give  if you feel you are lacking love  put love out into the world  give to receive  that is the universal law and it does not change   edit  i wish i could hug each one of you  i m honored that this post seems to have resonated with the community and that it may have helped some of you on your journey ,0
today i went up to an attractive girl that was selling stuff at a kiosk and opened up ive never in my life done this  but i thought whatever  gotta start somewhere and hit it off with her  i was there to buy something but we actually had a cool conversation and everything  then i asked if she had a number and she got sad and said sorry i have a boyfriend  but we were both cool about it  i even waved goodbye and she waved back  ive never done this and i had to pep talk myself to do it but it was honestly fun when i started the conversation  thank you to all the people on here for teaching me how to be social  i love you all    ,0
i approached a stranger today and it was awkward we are on empty college campus  she sits on a bench in the shade  watching something on her phone    i say hi  she doesnt hear me  louder  i say hey   she says  hey  and glances up  the video on her phone plays and she ignores me   what are you watching  i say   a ted talk  she says without looking up   silence  broken only by the sounds of the speaker   i think she doesnt want to talk  i start to write  we sit in silence for another minute  she stands up and leaves and i am alone    i know it sounds stupid and its not much but i am someone who has their guard up all the time  people i know think i am an asshole  they think i am the kind of guy who secretly has an impenetrable group of close friends but the truth is i have no one  its not easy for me to approach someone and make conversation and even though this didnt go well i am happy that i did something outside my comfort zone  ,0
is it possible to build or join social circle when youre     i mean im almost     and you can call me socially handicapped  ive never really had friends  i think i was lucky to have couple of acquaintances buddies in school and college  although ive never spent time outside school cause we didnt really share common interests  for the last   years i had zero social interaction outside my family and co workers   i still dream sometimes of having a seinfeld like nonsense stoner talk with couple of friends  i feel so sad i never got to talk about music i like or movies  pop culture in general   i feel miserable attending gigs  there are always cliques of people  ive never so far seen one dude or a girl brooding there alone  something i wished to encounter to maybe stike up some awkward conversation  but alas it never happened   i mean  is it doomed for me at all  i feel kinda like blackpilled  i realise now that miracles dont happen  you stay socially awkward when you dont practice enough  but what can i do at this point  i feel like im    years old  the age where probably it is legitimate to claim its impossible to create social networks unless you have managed to maintain some from you younger years  ,0
dont doubt yourself  even if it turns out youre dead fucking wrong  find that out after the fact  trust in yourself and the reward will be self esteem  confidence  and wisdom  even in error  edit    find out what works for you  but self discovery won t be found in self doubt  you need to have the courage to try and fail in life if you want to develop the confidence and self esteem that comes from knowing who you are  ,0
reciprocation im an idiot  after years of adulting  i often contemplated why people who had asked me out to do stuff with them  like grab lunch  stop by for a visit  go to an arcade  never asked to hang out again  i had an epiphany that maybe im supposed to ask them to go out and do something with me next    how can i be so dense  take this lesson from me  if you want people to hang out with  start inviting and reciprocating invitations  ,0
im the  um  actually     guy i dont know how to stop it  it feels like the only positive recognition i get is from being right about a subject  and thus i have a wide variety of knowledge  but i cant seem to interact with people correctly  im always just the ride  i dont need to be the perfect friend  i just need to know how to be a better one  how to laugh and understand without correcting people  ,0
happy birthday to me      i normally don t like celebrating my day  as i hate the spotlight being on me    but this is a special year    these last few years have been rough for me and i ve been trying to do better for myself and my future    despite how everything is right now  i m going to try to be optimistic from here on out  rather than my pessimist self    cheers      edit  omfg  today i honestly felt so much love   thank you all for your kind words and birthday wishes     ,0
today at a function i was depressed   sucidal and anti social  but then a few of my sisters friends said i look very decent and nice  this bossted my self esteem through the roof   then later my teachers said that im very handsome  this literally turned me into a social butterfly  need help     i had so much fun after that  it was amazing   so basically whenever i feel down from now onwards i will tell my self that im handsome and decent   hopefully this will give me the same effect that i got today   i want to learn how to give this effect to myself   i dont even know how to describe what happened   what happened actually   why did i take a     on being complimented   also how can i give myself this effect without depending on compliments  ,0
i make acquaintances easily but have a hard time reaching the friendship level  i get along well with people  but i can never connect on a deep enough level to actually hangout with outside of work social media  or someone will say  we should hangout sometime  but it will never actually happen  i m just so discouraged because i m going through a tough breakup right now and i have no girlfriends that i m close enough to to actually go out with on the weekends  ,0
does anyone elses brain stops thinking whenever they are next to someone new  yesterday  i hung out with a girl i met online  we have no problem having a conversation online  but when i saw her in real life  my brain kind of stops thinking altogether  im telling myself  cmon think think think  but nothing comes out of my mind  theres a lot of awkward silences and i sometimes ask a random question every now and then  how do you guys cope with those issues  ,0
i went shameless for one day today  i actually posted something on all   of my social media accounts  i even tried being active in some of them  adding random people and messaging them  sometimes i meet nice peole sometimes ehh  but damn  it might be a small and insignificant change from the ghost i used to be  im just sick of being a nobody  also its quite fun for me to start friendships with nothing even if its just in the internet  im proud of myself  someday i might be able to do this in real life   edit  thank you very much guys for all the uplifting words     ,0
people lose all respect for you if they see you not sticking up for yourself something i ve noticed lately is  if someone witnessed someone else being abusive rude to you or blatantly taking advantage of you  and you do not stand up for yourself and you let it happen  the person witnessing it will lose all respect for you   i ve noticed in my own life instances where people have witnessed me getting picked on  and me not sticking up for myself  and they would begin to look upon me with distain and pity me  sometimes they would begin to pick on me as well   other times they would remain nice to me  but i could tell by their actions that they no longer respected me or took my opinions seriously because they knew they could take advantage of me at any time   it sounds really obvious  but it s something that i didn t realise until recently  it s not fair at all  because the person who is doing the bullying is the one in the wrong  but that is how i ve noticed things to be  you re automatically at the bottom of the  social standing  if you do not stand up for yourself  i also find that i lose a bit of respect for people who let themselves get pushed around  it s like  that person clearly doesn t care about or respect themselves  so why should i     and in order to have healthy friendships relationships  there needs to be mutual respect  let this be a lesson to people pleasers or people who try too hard to be liked  ,0

i engaged in conversation with a stranger on a long bus ride i took a   hour bus ride and somewhere along the way i asked the person next to me if its their first bus ride to the destination where we were going  i was solving an axel cube  a type of rubicks cube  in the meantime  i noticed he looked at me solving the cube and asked him if he has ever gotten to try and solve this type of cube  i proceeded to teach him on how to solve this type of cube  even though he gave up along the way i made a travel buddy and it was a nice time  ,0

i like socializing but get burnt out way too quickly  if i m in a good mood i ll be able to talk for longer  and be myself which i can tell people like  the thing is  some days for a reason i can t really explain i m just really reserved  my jokes aren t as quick  i can t really get people s attention the same way and i can tell people notice    i ll be really cool one day and the next i m like just not there  and like i said  people notice  this happens with pretty much most people that aren t my really good friends  i don t even get anxiety or anything  it s just i get burnt out real quick   is there anything i can do  i like talking to people and really have no problem making new friends or anything  but it sucks feeling like people are disappointed in me after making a good impression and fucking it up by being dry the very next time  ,0
introverts need social lives  too i have a couple of introvert friends that i recently spoke to about this with  and they said that they had experienced this  too  so it got me thinking that maybe this is a fairly common issue  so i thought id share it here for anyone who might need to hear it   i dont know how i got this idea into my head  but i used to think  as an introvert  that because being around people was exhausting  i didnt need social interaction all that much  i got what i needed at work and that was good enough  for about four years  i would go to work  talk shop  go home  and repeat  as time went on  i grew more and more depressed  socially anxious  and ive found it increasingly difficult to relate to people on a basic level  all of the above affected my sense of self worth  the relationships i did have either suffered or faded away entirely  i recognized this was a problem about a year ago and have started working on re socializing myself ever since  my life has improved dramatically  i like myself more  i like people more  i feel like im just growing as a person more  its like i have to relearn all the social skills i developed in highschool and then some  but its been a great and exciting year    even though social interaction might be exhausting  its still crucial to do for your mental health and personal growth  shallow work relationships are not enough to keep you healthy  you need people to confide in and share your thoughts and experiences with  and people to listen to and to learn from  these things are just as important for introverts as they are for extroverts  we just need to rest a bit between social experiences  ,0

killing it on my social anxiety    i left a super abusive relationship not too long ago and for a long time i was speaking with a stutter and feeling really inferior to other people  i had little to no friends and had to do a bunch of work to go out and meet people    i took a job at a new office for a fresh start and im really starting to come back to myself  throwing out witty banter and asking others to go hang out    i love my work day cause its where i get almost all my socialization in and on weekends i try to challenge myself to be more confident around my new so   its pretty hard sometimes but today has been fucking awesome  im so stoked  ,0
i cant speak to people when they are in groups  i am very good at one on one conversations with people  even if we share no common interests i can hold up a conversation  i cant do the same when i have to converse or convey my message to a group of people  i get really nervous and dont really deliver the message pretty well  i tried to console myself thinking that delivering messages was like that for everyone and no one can get the message across to everyone  but one of my teachers gets the attention of the whole class and everyone becomes intent on listening to what he says  i always have the thought  are they understanding what im saying  do they feel like im just blabbering some shit   this ruins my whole delivery  can anyone help me with this  ,0
anyone feel like they miss out on opportunities due to poor social skills   started watching movies like lost in translation  and a few other ones where connections are made through bantering  talking and sharing fun times  i feel like poor social skills causes me to miss out on these things  like an access to another world  or human being is denied due to it  which is a shame  once you have it once though  i can see why people enjoy this  ,0
how do i cope with the fact that i m not attractive as other people  you see  you only live once  you only get one body  and it can vary between ugly and attractive  i m one of the ugly guys  every time i see a very attractive girl or guy  i just wish that i was born in a body attractive like theirs  my ugliness has been affecting my life for a very long time  and is going to affect my future  and how  i have an extremely hard time finding love and making friends all because of how i look  girls have called me ugly several times  and every girl ai ve asked out has said no  why  because i m ugly  what should i do with my life  should i commit suicide  my life is not worth living if i m ugly and not going to get married  all because i m ugly  all  because  i m  ugly  i never chose this body  i never chose this life  i don t know what to do anymore  ,0

please dont say  enjoy time with yourself  to those who are lonely one small rant  im tired of those who say   maybe you should focus on you and enjoy time by yourself   when im lonely  its like telling somebody with their head under water to breathe easy for awhile  saying  focus on yourself  is like saying  be happy with isolation    its condescending  and it invalidates the lonely person     rant ,0
the nicer i am to people  the less they care about me  i by no means believe in the nice guys come last philosophy    however it does feel like the more attention or emotion i show somebody  the less inclined they are to reply quickly to my messages or care about me in general    whenever i purposefully give someone less attention or pretend i dont care  suddenly they flood me with messages and crave for my attention in person    i dont really know what to do   i want to be nice and show empathy to people but every time i do i only end up feeling more distant and less significant to people   edit  thank you for all of your heartfelt replies and advice    its very much appreciated  ,0
if you want to be adopted by an extrovert  let them know youre available for adoption    it probably wont take as much effort as you may think  choose someone who is kind and outgoing and who is at least a friendly acquaintance of yours  wait until you see them make someone laugh or  better  until you see them do something really adept  like diffuse a tense situation  if theyre alone sometime in the next few minutes and not in any particular rush  say something like   youre so good with people   wait a minute if you like before following up with a question like   did you grow up in a large family    if the person is extroverted enough  you may not even need the question    im not saying that   boom   youll instantly be besties  sometimes  it wont work  in that case  youll likely get a smile  a  thanks  and little else  on the other hand  it may go much better  the combination of a genuine and meaningful compliment that they werent expecting plus a request for further engagement  the follow up question  has a decent chance of at least putting you on their social radar  even if youre not immediately adopted     moreover  most socially aware people will understand that your compliment to them     youre so good with people     includes the subtext that you arent that comfortable socially  kind  socially skilled people may well take that as an invitation not only to introduce you to others  but to look out for you   just a little bit        in social situations  ,0
the best way to stop being lonely is to act like someone who isnt lonely  heres how      the best way to stop being lonely is to act like someone who isnt lonely     this is the real fake it til you make it  sadly  nothing is a bigger social repellant than loneliness  people dont want to take on your emotional baggage when they barely know you  and people dont want to feel like they are interesting to you purely based on the fact that they are better than nothing   so you need to get out there and meet people  but as if you already have a basically completely full life and are willing to make some space for them   when people are friendly to you and make overtures  say yes  but dont over do it  these overtures likely mean they are somewhat interested in getting to know you better  not interviewing you to immediately be their new best friend or love of their life   remind yourself to take things slow      in conversations  ask engaged questions rather than working hard on presenting yourself in the best possible light     theres a difference between just waiting for your turn to talk in a conversation and genuinely listening and responding in an engaged way  when you meet new people  be patient with the conversations and dont worry too much about how impressive you seem    it usually makes a better impression on people if you are a good  engaged listener   if you are too preoccupied with impressing the other person  its easy to get in the position of just waiting for your turn and not truly engaged in the conversation  let people ask  you  questions and get to know you in their own way  at their own pace      pursue your personal interests     join a writing workshop  take a language class  learn how to throw a pot  learn how to tap dance  if you have time be lonely  you likely have a lot of time on your hands  use it  activities that are doing what you love are good for the soul  keep you busy and with a full life  and you will meet people with common interests this way  it also makes you way more interesting when you meet other new people     initiate plans with the friends you already have     maybe you have friends but still feel lonely because you feel like you dont spend enough time together  while this might leave you feeling like even your friends dont like you very much  or dont care enough  thats rarely the case  most people are pretty self centered and kind of glide through life reacting to situations  rather than being  pro active   when your friends dont call you  its not because they dont care  its likely because they arent thinking as far ahead as you are  they arent thinking about that much other than themselves or maybe their immediate nuclear family  so  if you are the one feeling lonely  its good if you are the asking to make the plans  dont feel bad about always being the initiator with people  its a great characteristic to have and develop  initiators are why relationships last      if you feel like you are being stepped on because you are  too nice   you might not be as nice as you think     there is a difference between being a genuinely kind person    one who is generous  empathic  flexible  and forgiving    and someone who is acting nice and amenable because they think it will make them more likeable or datable  people can tell the difference      get out of bad romantic relationships  being lonely because you are with the wrong person feels worse than being lonely because you are actually alone     sometimes the loneliest people actually have a partner    but it is not a good fit   the initial break up will probably feel like shit times ten  but once the acute period rolls back  you will likely feel much much better   get a break up buddy for this  call a friend  and its doesnt even need to be a very close one  and recruit  i recommend selecting someone who has been through a break up relatively recently  this is the person you call or text when you are tempted to call or tempt your ex  this is the person you vent to in those first few weeks of wallowing  this is the person who will get your ass out of the house and back into life when its time to stop the wallowing period  an important point embedded in here is that just having a partner is no panacea for issues of unhappiness and loneliness  dont romanticize the idea that all you need is a serious romantic relationship and then youll be all set    ,0
i m so unlikable that people get upset being associated with me this girl came up to me today and said  your best friends with      right  and i said  i ve never even talked to him  and she said  ok well go talk to him and pretend to be his friend  and i asked why and her response was  because everyone keeps saying you are best friends because it makes him mad   i don t think it was her intention but it hurt my feelings  but it did  i know i m awkward and annoying but i try my best to be normal and it sucks to hear that it s not working  sorry to rant i just needed to  ,0
about trying too hard for a long time  i wondered why some really quiet and introverted people could be popular and respected while others were seen as outcasts  i was always told that in order to have a better social life  i would need to subject myself to lots of small talk and force myself to socialize with many different people  i tried so hard to introduce myself to others and have something to contribute to every conversation  but i still struggled socially  what i realize now is that the biggest enemy of being accepted socially is trying too hard  good social skills means that you say something when you have a worthwhile contribution  but feel comfortable staying quiet at times  you dont always have to be surrounded by friends  you dont need to kiss up to powerful people or read what everyone else is reading or dress fashionably  you can do strange things such as wearing the identical outfit every day or owning only a flip phone and its okay as long as youre okay with it part of being charismatic is being totally comfortable in social situations  or  if you are socially anxious  being comfortable with the discomfort  dont force yourself to make small talk about stupid things if thats not your style  most people dont even like small talk think of your favorite characters on tv  are they the ones who were always socially smooth  think rosa from brooklyn     chandler from friends  dwight from the office  eleven from stranger things  these characters are likable because they portray the quirkiness in humans  we find them funny even if they are annoying at times and occasionally embarrass themselves    dont delete a comment just because it got downvoted  unless  of course  the comment is offensive or inappropriate   stop driving yourself crazy trying to learn the  tricks  to charisma or the perfect way to size up body language  ask yourself   what kind of social situations genuinely bring me joy and stimulate my brain   of course  this advice isnt for everybody and some people could benefit from taking a social skills class or developing their ability to make small talk  im not saying those things are useless  all im saying is that you should not ruin a perfectly good personality by polishing it up according to other peoples standards  dont work too hard to earn the approval of others  and youll find that socializing gets more manageable over time  im really writing this mostly as a note to myself  but in reddit so that maybe others can benefit as well  thanks for reading and wishing you all the best  ,0
how to stop being the guy that rarely says anything  everyone always sees me as the quiet guy  its not like im keeping things to myself  but ideas and thoughts dont come to me as often as it seems to happen for most people  i also have some social anxiety im sure  one on one i can hold up a conversation just find  but add more people and im sitting out  also my voice is on the deeper side so its hard for me to hear myself when theres loud music in the background  how do i get out of this pit  ,0
i feel sad when i see attractive people because i m not attractive as them i m a male speaking   there are so many attractive people in this world  every time i see one  i think to myself   why couldn t i be born as one of these people  why did i have to be born in this ugly terrifying body   there is only one chance at life  and you either get a good one or a bad one  sadly  natural selection has made me an ugly person  or for some people  sort of average  my eyes are bulging out  my nose is flat  my hair is flat like paper  my cheeks are chubby  you name it all  almost every day  i think to myself   will any girl ever like me  will any girl out of my race or league even like me   i feel like being ugly to certain degree would be fine for some girls women  but being beyond ugly is just a big waste of life  i feel like my life is worthless because of my ugly body  i feel like no one in this world would ever fall in love with me  personality  why would a girl choose me if i m ugly  regardless of personality  i don t think anyone would like me because of how i look  i guess suicide is the only option  what s the point in living if i m going to be lonely and single all my life   edit  i read every single one of your guy s comments  and i appreciate the help a bunch ,0
i chatted up strangers in a coffee shop today  im getting over my anxiety  this felt like a big step for me   so  i live in a city that gets a lot of tourists in the spring and summer  two women with a dog  were sitting at the table next to me on the cafe patio  and suddenly  the perfect line hit me   are you guys tourists or locals    we introduced ourselves  and the conversation got to did you just come back from that hike  what kind of dog is she  theres so much more to this place than such and such area  i have the travel bug  etc       i didnt make any plans with them and they left before i did  but that wasnt the point  im going to keep practicing so i can get more comfortable with people  maybe this making friends thing aint so hard  ,0
i watched a movie at a theatre alone for the first time  so a few days ago  i asked my friends if they wanted to go see a particular movie  bring the soul  most of them were busy with work  and only one friend was available  but i felt that it would be awkward because im not really good at talking to people one on one  so i told him i would hang out with him another day    anywaysss at first i thought i would just wait until i could find the movie online somewhere  but i kept seeing ads for it and i really wanted to watch it more and more  thats when i decided to go see it alone  im not gonna lie  i felt really nervous  i had to go to new jersey at my cousins place for a party  but my aunt told me she could drop me off at the movie theatre before the party started  i brought my army bomb  a light stick that syncs with others at the groups concerts  which is super freaking cool  in hopes that other people would  i got popcorn and soda and went inside  i swear i was the only guy in the movie theatre  everyone i saw was a girl aged from id say        while i was the only guy whos    almost turning      so i head to my seat and i know for a fact that a lot of the girls were staring at me  then the movie started and for the first few minutes it felt weird  i think i heard some girls talk about me  saying i was cute and that they never expected a guy to come  but the rest of the time  i felt happy  i even turned on my light stick and i started hearing a lot of the girls in the room say  omg i shouldve brought mine     i think that for me  watching the movie really helped me get over my depression  i left that movie theatre in a really good mood  ever since then  ive been working out  eating somewhat healthy  and havent felt really sad at all  i still feel a little weird about having gone to go see a movie alone  but it was worth it       edit  for anyone asking  the movie is about the recently famous kpop group  bts  the movie highlights the journey theyve been on to get to where they are now and shows the struggles theyve went through  i also really relate to one of the members because we both had the same self conscious problems about our bodies  ive been listening to their music since       and their music helped me through really tough times dealing with family and recently college   edit    omg i was not expecting this many comments  ty all  im sorry if i gave half assed replies  im like half asleep half awake when i saw them  one of my first few posts on reddit  so sorry if i broke any rules    edit    so a few people mentioned this    ik that this kind of post doesnt relate to social skills much  i didnt realise it until a few hours later  but i have seen people post stuff like this on this subreddit before  and i did in fact gain some confidence in talking to strangers because right after the movie ended  a few of the girls who sat behind me actually wanted to talk to me  sorry i didnt add this part  i completely forgot about it ,0

being able to accept compliments is as important as being able to give them i know someone who is in my product class  drawing pages of designs and concepts  and he knows his artwork is amazing  and people are always complimenting him on it  but he will deny the compliment  saying that its terrible  i would do anything to be able to draw as well as him  but him saying that his drawings look bad make myself feel kinda shit as well   now modesty is one thing  but refusing compliments makes the person who is complimenting the person feel unheard    next time someone compliments you  accept it  and thank them  after all  you probably deserve it  ,0
does anyone else feel like their public and private self are two different people     f  im not sure how to accurately describe what im talking about  but when im at work i think ive accidentally become someone whos known for being really outgoing and i like to make people laugh  but i think in being like this  i say things that i dont really mean  im just saying them for attention or to be  funny   then when i come back home and im by myself again i feel really embarrassed and insecure about almost everything ive said during the day  i consider myself to be a very sympathetic  empathetic and kind person  but i dont think people really would describe me as that when they speak to me  i think i find it awkward to tell people how im really feeling or about what i think about something  so i just turn everything into a joke kinda   how do i stop doing this  should i meditate or something  ,0
does anyone else end up in a conversation but they can t think of anything to say to contribute  i was with a group a while ago and i wasn t saying much  but it wasn t because i didn t want to talk it was because i genuinely had nothing to say   how do you fix this ,0
try not to interrupt people  but if you slip up  do this  no one likes to be interrupted    but look  its bound to happen from time to time   maybe your new friend brings up something that you know a lot about  and you interject    i know your interruption was coming from a great place   heres what you can say to get back on track and show the other person that you were listening  not just waiting for your turn to speak     before i interrupted you  you were saying xyz     this phrase is gold   it acknowledges that you interrupted  and it demonstrates that you were listening     listening so well that you can provide them a jumping off point to get back to what they were saying    if you are the one who gets interrupted  its actually a good thing  let them finish their thought and then say     going back to what i was saying about xyz       this is subtle  youre not calling them out  youre just doing a little conversational nudge    if they get the hint  great  if not  rinse and repeat     also  group conversations     group conversations is an important area of social skills  often people are talking over each other and interrupting a lot  it can feel a little confusing    i get asked about having better group conversations a lot   i created an audio guide to join   enjoy group conversations you might check out  https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html   in the audio guide youll learn    how to jump into a conversation that has no opening   genuinely connect with anyone about any topic   how to get out of your head and stay present in group conversations    and more  word for word scripts  body language while joining a group  etc    enjoy   https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html  ,0
found other awkward folks and it felt like my people i conquered social anxiety yesterday by going to an event i knew no one at  once there  i started to feel the anxiety rise again   i saw two people at a table kind of away from the other groups that looked like they didn t know anybody  i went right up to them and asked if i could join   they were super welcoming  we talked about the awkwardness we were all feeling  and we exchanged numbers to maybe hang out later    shit y all   that s how that works  ,0

i went from not having any semblance of social skills to realizing that all i needed was some eye contact to get people to treat me normally  my whole life eye contact has been a struggle  personal issues werent helping my confidence and making eye contact was just flat out scary  im no chicken  so i decided that since i was sick of feeling out of place during every conversation  i would go ahead and literally face my fear    i started with observing the frequency that people broke eye contact  and with that information slowly dipped my toe in the water  i tried to hold eye contact for as long as possible during each conversation i had with someone  every time i felt uncomfortable  i broke eye contact  slowly but surely i got less and less uncomfortable  leading me to have the ability to hold eye contact for a healthy amount of time    last night  i was chilling with my homies and over the course of the night i kept pushing through with the eye contact and by the end of the night i had gotten compliments and i could clearly see that my friends were seeing the effort i had put in  the eyes are the windows to the soul  and if i dont let anyone look into my soul by being vulnerable  trust will be difficult to develop  idk i am no pro writer but i hope this can help someone whos struggling and needs a happy boost   ,0
how do i stop being so passive  i feel like my whole life i ve always had a very passive mindset and i m pretty much indifferent to every aspect of life  that s not to say i m unhappy  i just choose to stay open minded and go with the flow  however  i ve noticed that it is hard for me to hold conversations with people  especially girls  because i have difficulty forming original thoughts  or i literally just don t care about what the other person is saying  i ve had multiple experiences where girls have literally approached me and i just blew it because i cant muster more than one word responses  i need advice on how to actually fully engage in conversation and at least pretend to show interest in what someone is saying  ,0
no one really cares what you do i thought people on this sub would be slightly awkward like me  but i ve seen the vast majority of this sub has very few friends and can t hold simple conversations  a lot of this is from fear of being judged  here are the two biggest tips  you have to realize that no one gives a shit what you re doing or what you said  they ll forget about it in minutes  no one really cares what you re doing  they re too focused on themselves  you also don t have to kiss ass to anyone  don t overcompliment them or try to hard to be their friend  just be yourself  ,0
i ve noticed i isolate myself quite a bit and i know it s healthy to get out and make friends but i secretly prefer being isolated i have an unspecified mood disorder that lines up with bipolar  i dissociate very often and i m really bad at taking criticism  i had an ex that took advantage of my mental illness before i was medicated and he manipulated me into becoming an apologetic foot shuffling mouse  i hate being this way  i wish i was confident again  but my brain makes me push people away and makes it harder for me to even want to open up to anybody  i can t help pushing people away either  it freaks me out when they get too close because most people i ve gotten close to have left suddenly without much explanation    i guess i isolate myself because i m afraid of being disappointed  or disappointing others  i m not sure  i d like for this to stop so i can feel better but i know deep down that part of me enjoys the solitude  and that i don t know if i like people at all anymore  ,0
i suck at hints and i think i missed an opportunity lol so theres this girl i work with who covers my breaks  we chat a lot before i go on my break and after  sometimes it has me losing track of time  last night  we were talking about some stuff and the topic went to food  so i was recommending restaurants and favorite foods  and she did the same  telling me that theres this place that just opened up and shed like to try it  as well as some other places  she told me to go there first and tell her how it is first  and i just responded  uhm  i could but you seem far more interested to try it lol so you first     teasingly  but what i should have said is  why dont we both just go and try it     she kept saying how much she wants to go to these places and then told me she was off saturday and i completely missed that   big oof   edit  i asked her  saturdays on   ,0

if you think your anxiety is your parents fault  maybe  when wondering about your anxiety you might think  if only they had raised me differently  emotionally stronger  with more emotional intelligence i would be a more mature and strong person today   id agree and disagree  here it goes    id agree because  yea people never get a perfect upbringing if you were to talk about the problems with your parents they might even agree they could have been better    id disagree because  ok       of emotional problems are their fault  now if you were to call your parents  blame them for everything  make them guilty for all of it  now what  would you become stronger now  a more emotionaly balanced person  would your parents lives be better  the maximum you could get is their apology and compreension  which is great of course  but wont change the past   the point is  there is absolutely no advantage about ruminating about the bad upbringing  not publicly not in your mind  of course most people would never blame their parents direcly and make them feel bad  but you are perfectly able to do it forever in your mind  doing so might give you some relief  but you wont get anywhere with that line of thought   the world was not fair with you but you can be fair with yourself  choosing the best options  doing what you know will direcly affect your life positively is what will make a difference  stop looking at the past and look foward  what can be done from now   its not avoiding the problems but acting besides them  this is hard  but acting on what you think would make you a better person is what really makes you feel that way  blaming others wont help   it might be important to analyze and understand what happened  why you are the way you are  and understand your cause and effect  so you can change and not cause the same mistakes with someone else  for example  my point is  not leltting the excuses be bigger than your will to do better   psychological help is important if you think you cant move by yourself or if you want to treat issues related to your parents  ,0
are we becoming more lonelier because meeting true people today is almost impossible  i am an introvert and have never been good at making friends  and right now i have no friends  only acquaintances  nor i am interested in making new ones  but my question is not about me  but about regular extroverts around me  i don t see real happiness in their expressions  there is always a lot of complaining  a lot of back talking  backstabbing  gossiping  so that is why i think a lot of people are now more time in social media  talking with celebrities  talking to people they have never seen in their life  and aside from that they feel lonelier  the percent of lonely people is pretty high in the us and many developed countries  at the end most people are just like me but since i have always been that way i am used to that  ,0

i finally stood my ground and got rid of a toxic friend the breaking point was when i saw him touching one of my other friends  who is a woman  inappropriately  her leg thighs  lower back near her butt  kissing her cheeks and forehead  while she was in a very vulnerable position  drunk and upset   i decided that was it  i tried my best to keep him out of the room without causing any commotion  she didn t remember a lot of the night  so i told her what he did  she also had a boyfriend that didn t know this happened at the time  she deserved to know and i fully stand by my decision to tell her  when this  friend  found out that i told her  he tried denying it and then reverted to calling me numerous names  i wished him the best  blocked him  and moved on  he has done plenty of other things that  for lack of a better term  disgust me  overall  i would say this situation is very indicative of the kind of person he is  i was always worried about what he would do or say about me  but the heaviest weight was finally lifted off of my shoulders  this is not something i would have done in the past  but i m glad i was able to muster together some balls and stand my ground   edit  this post us received much more attention than i could have imagined  i just want to say to every single person replying to this post and every person who has upvoted it  etc  thank you for all the support  i really appreciate the kind words  also  i did revise some parts to make the post shorter  i removed a lot of the filler info to try and keep it more on topic  ,0
the moment i realized just how gloriously easy it is to pick up girls   and people in general  as a teen i was super nervous and shy  i didn t dare approach girls at all  and not out of fear of rejection  but simply because i didn t believe in myself to get my point across  i believed i wasn t charismatic enough  funny enough  handsome enough  i thought i d never change  and so i always sabotaged myself before even trying   at some point when i was    i realized all of a sudden   i just tried it once  once  i said fuck it  i m alive now  so i started a conversation  being ridiculously direct was fun as hell    hey  i think you re really pretty  what s your name   saying anything along those lines  with a smile on your face   it s literally like throwing a spell and seeing people s faces light up  it s so good  every time it worked  it seemed surreal  and every time it didn t  i was still incredibly proud of myself for just doing it  i saw how different things were between my point of view and other people s minds  you see   women  and  actually all human beings really love to feel like they are attractive  feeling desired  chosen  it s a wonderful feeling  even when they already have someone or if they don t find you attractive  they still feel positive about you and the fact that you came up to them   to this day and after many years  it s still the same thing  asked a girl on the bus for her number a couple weeks ago and she adored the situation  and just this last weekend i tried my luck with another one at a party and got instantly rejected  and getting rejected feels so damn good  man  you tried  it didn t work  keep rolling   so that was a crazy click  and little by little i grew so confident that i felt like someone completely new  or maybe like a kind of myself that was lying dormant and waited for me to start daring myself more  i know it s not easy  but pushing yourself little by little and trusting that you will be all right really transforms you without even noticing   so about the title   earlier this year certain situation came up   i fell in love with someone that already had a partner  and in that moment i looked back at   yo me that could not even speak to someone i found pretty  i wanted to grab that younger me by the elbows and just go  dude  you thought romancing available girls was hard      this is an actual issue right here   if only i knew this when i was         eventually i realized i was just infatuated and not actually in love  thank god   and now we re friends and i enjoy being with her tons  and her bf  too      so i d like to leave a little piece of advice for anyone who is having a hard time with shyness or feels stuck in a version of themselves that they don t like  try  it will be hard  your heart will pound  it ll be intense  you might even feel ill  and whatever the outcome  you won t believe the smile on your face when it s over  and the more you dare  the more you ll change and grow confident  until one day you ll realize you re feeling like goddam emo peter parker dancing on the streets of ny in spider man     hope this helps someone just like little me     thanks for the silver kind stranger  it s my first one   and a second one  wasn t expecting that  thank you  ,0

painfully shy like me  this is making an incredible difference for me here are   things that helped me      listen intently to people when they are talking to me and do nothing else     share more  anything interesting     be assertive take initiative  know my wants and needs  and express them  these all tie in together for me     experience more in life  as much as i can handle     prioritize physical well being  have a good diet  exercise routine  stay well hydrated  etc   that was the tldr   before i started these   specific  extremely practical behavioral changes  i have always  for a very long time  been uncomfortable around people  struggled to hold a conversation  and had a very difficult time making any sort of a connection with the vast majority of people  before implementing these   things  even though i had known for a long time that i have an anxiety issue  i did not make much progress in dealing with my social inadequacies  but now i have made an unbelievable difference in a very short amount of time  a matter of days   i describe how i feel now as me finally being on the right wavelength to be social and carry on a conversation  i am a lot more comfortable in my own skin  conversations come much more naturally to me  i have always been a very quiet guy but now sometimes  i talk  i still have a lot of work to do  i hope this post can help you   the rest of this post will be going into detail on each of these behavioral changes     x   b      listening intently  oftentimes when people would talk to me  i wasnt listening very great at all  i thought i was  but i wast  this is why  i was trying to listen  while also trying to make sure im making enough eye contact  and trying to come up with what im going to say when they are done talking  that is way too much to try to focus on at once and i would fail to do well at any of those  you really can only focus on one thing at a time  in order for conversation to work for me  i need to devote all of my attention to what the other person is communicating to me when they are speaking     share more  i did not share much with people at all  and it seems obvious why this is bad  but i was so unaware of how much this was absolutely crippling me socially  ive been aware that i have anxiety issues for a while  and i was someone who wanted to avoid having attention on me  so i didnt share much at all  so now i am sharing more  even the simplest of things  i will tell someone one fun thing i did on the weekend or some time recently  something that i watched that i found interesting  the point is  im sharing now even if its just a little bit interesting  its great to share even before being asked about something  this has been so important for my ability to start conversations and so effective to get myself to connect with people  im just sharing what i found interesting  what did i think  what did i feel  include this stuff when sharing  share from my point of view  this is what i saw  what i was doing  how i felt  etc  from reading this  it sounds like oversharing  but no  share often  but keep it relatively short and sweet     assertiveness  this one is huge  i was the opposite of assertive  but now i am trying to be a lot more assertive  this is how i am going about it  i am constantly trying to be more aware of what i want need and and once i figure that out  go after it  take initiative to do what i want rather than having to check or worry what someone else says about it   if its something i need want from a person  i make sure i tell them  often times it is very simple  so heres a simple example  at work i needed to roll a cart to where someone was standing  so i simply told him   i want to put this cart there   he moved for me  i thanked him  this is the smallest of examples but honestly  before working on being assertive in this way  i may have had a difficult time asking him to move   because i was way more concerned about making sure i dont bother anyone  and coming up with the best wording of how to ask him to move  than i was about what i want  theres a pretty good chance i wouldnt have decided on the perfect sentence and would have just been awkwardly standing near him for a while before finally attempting to deliver my super scripted sentence  simply stating what i want need to the person that needs to know has been incredibly useful in plenty of situations already   i have also decided that i want people to hear me clearly when i speak   as i have always spoken so quietly  nervously   so i am doing my best to make sure i speak loudly enough to capture peoples attention and so they can hear me clearly  the reason i would speak so quietly is because  often i didnt want anyone else nearby to  hear what i said at all  i need to not worry about that   i am also working on implementing a conflict resolution strategy  previously i avoided conflict as much as possible because i was used to ignoring what i wanted for the most part  i could rationalize to myself to tolerate things that i shouldnt have and did not need to tolerate if i was able to speak up about it  i would rationalize that saying something wasnt worth the conflict and always wanted to be non confrontational  i have completely scrapped that way of thinking  in conflict  i cant always just tell someone what i want need from them  i need to do more than that  so here it is  if there is something someone is doing that is bothering me  first i find out what emotion the issue is making me feel  then i tell the person  i feel  emotion  because of  the thing theyre doing thats not okay  i want you to stop  if applicable i then tell them what i want them to do instead  e g  im getting annoyed when you talk over me  can you try not to cut me off  i am realizing i can confront people by doing this  and as long as they are reasonable  it wont turn into a huge argument like i was worried about happening     x   b        experience more  i believe experiencing more  is living more  i find that i learn so much when trying something new that i want to try  figure out things i want to try doing and plan to do it  i think it also helps to remember experiences better and to articulate myself by keeping a journal and writing it as if i am sharing it with someone  again  what i found interesting  from my point of view   writing it in that style  doing more things and journaling gives me a lot more to share  and less time spent sitting around over thinking over analyzing       physical well being  its a no brainer but there are tremendous benefits in all aspects of life to be in good physical shape including socially  more energetic  better mood  clearer thinking  better posture  feeling more accomplished  less anxious   im writing this because i think its some info that could help people climb out of the same hole i got myself into by having my largest life interest at one time  hockey  turn into something i didnt want anything to do with   while at the same time becoming indifferent about life because i lacked interests  all i started to do was game and watch tv  suffering hard for it in my social life  i have to not be self destructive and i did myself no good with a lot of bad habits  those bad habits are  sitting around being in my own head way too much  rather than having something else to do   beating myself up over failing so bad socially  not exercising  smoking a lot of weed  avoiding contact with friends and family  not trying very many new things at all  being extremely passive   i feel a lot more comfortable around people  i think they are more comfortable around me and respect me more  i respect myself more  my conversations are improving tremendously  i got a coworker to stop over talking about his love for his guns  which was driving me nuts until i confronted him appropriately  i will no longer wait so long on an issue   i got my name on the bosss list to get trained in extra skills simply because i wanted it and i asked for it  i got another coworker to provide much needed relief for me in my job by having them take over  working outside in hot weather   ive even avoided an unnecessary safety hazard by telling my coworker how i wanted something handled rather than just following what they wanted me to do  ive resolved new issues that came up swiftly instead of letting it eat away at me mentally  all these things probably wouldnt have happened before i knew the importance of certain behaviors i  personally  needed to implement  all my relationships with friends and family are better  i am making great progress at being someone that can start conversations and connect with people   if you have any behavioral changes to add  i would love to read  ,0
i don t have anyone i am currently in college and i have no friends  most of my friends ditched me before i graduated high school and the few friends i thought i had left don t talk to me at all  i always have to message them first and even so they don t respond back until the next day  i just don t understand why no one likes me  i feel alone all the time and i just wish that someone out there liked me for me  i thought college was supposed to be the time of your life  ,0
is it weird for a woman to compliment a random guy s clothes hair whatever  i present as female and i do this all the time to other women  and other women have done it to me on occasion  sometimes if i m walking around campus  not so much public places  i ll see a guy who s wearing something really cool like a rainbow sweater or a bomber jacket or something and i ll want to tell him  nice jacket  as i pass  but the one time i did this to a guy  he looked literally terrified  to be fair  i m one of those people who others try hard not to look at because i m ugly as a dog  which is an insult to dogs  so i think he thought i was trying to flirt with him or something and saw his life flash before his eyes  is complimenting random guys on their clothes seen as flirting if it comes from a woman  if so  that s pretty depressing  guys deserve random  innocent compliments from strangers on potentially risky clothing hair choices too  ,0
anyone else who cant connect with others their age  its a cliche to say you are an old soul      of people who say it are probably just trying to be unique  i wouldnt even say that this describes me  but what i would say is that i just cant really connect with people my age  just for context  im a m     in college  just one example  music  at this point  i just cant get into music that most people my age listen to  i have connected with some friends from high school over a love of rock music  but even then theyre more into metal  whereas my interests are more eclectic  thats a small and mostly harmless example  but it feels that way to me for modern culture in general  i see the way people my age act and talk  the things they like  the things that are important to them  and i just cant connect with it  its not that i feel im better than them  in fact  often times i feel like some sort of alien who appears human on the surface  but deep down im not the same  i know that sentence sounds a little off putting  and slightly sociopathic  but i really just mean that i feel like im on a different wavelength than everybody else   this is probably heightened being at college  i go to class  i even have made some friends in class  and theyre really nice people  but past the surface level of maybe a shared interest in our majors  personally  i feel like we wouldnt connect  i dont have the same humor as people my age  especially other guys my age  im not as easily amused by the mere mention of sex or drugs  or just cursing  i also dont drink  but its not cause i have anything against it  its just not for me  im not sober either  i smoke weed pretty often    i just cant seem to find others who have the same demeanor as me  im very anti conflict and even keeled  i feel like my chill attitude comes across as boring though  id have no problem just sitting in a living room playing music and reading a book  in the most unpretentious way possible  i like things that relax me  but most people my age need to be stimulated by something  im very much a you do you and ill do me kind of person  but a lot of people in general seem to care what others do as well  maybe its the fact that everyone just wants to fit in and feel accepted  and at this point i just dont see how feigning interest in things to feel accepted is worth it  im not the most confident person  but in the past couple of years i have learned to accept who i am and not try to be someone im not    this rant hasnt been very well organized  and theres so many other things i could have said  but i just needed to get this off my chest  im sure theres others like me on here  and id love to hear your experiences  ,0

how can i overcome childhood emotional neglect  hi  i want to talk about something personal  so i ve been having a lot of ups and downs  and i realize i have been suffering from childhood emotional neglect  i have always been very shy and insecure about myself  because i felt like i didn t get the help i needed as a child  and it leaves me feeling very empty and lonely inside  i feel like i didn t have a proper childhood  because i didn t learn to be myself and to be comfortable with who i am  because i got bullied a lot in elementary school for being different  and i thought everyone hated me and i should give in and make other people happy  i created a fake ego  and it put me in a darker and darker place the older i became  it just became more and more obvious that i was pretending  and i was really trapped  there was no way i was going to grow up being that person  so i have lately been trying very hard to work on learning what i didn t learn as a child  and to take steps and to be the person who i am  not the person other people tell me i am  what are some ways that have helped you overcome negative childhood experiences  ,0

how i raised my self esteem i had really low self esteem because my friends were always making fun of me for being chubby and awkward  everyday i would dwell on all the stupid things i had said and what i should have said  so  i became secluded and extremely shy  but recently  over thanksgiving break  i started to think about everything my friends said that was wrong  i thought about everything all my other acquaintances said that sounded stupid  and i realized i was overreacting  nobody cares what i said and i shouldnt have cared what my friends said about me because it was just a joke  so  while this didnt cure my lack of confidence  i dont think i am a useless freak anymore  ,0
sometimes i m in the mood to talk but most of the time i keep to myself  one day my social juices were just flowing and i was in a great mood  it was enough that one of my coworkers said i was acting  weird  and asked if i was ok      i didn t really know how to respond  i was in a good mood and was having conversations with coworkers  more than usual  and i just get asked if i m okay and why i was acting weird  i m not sure why but this has also kind of discouraged me from talking when that coworker is around  how would you deal with trying to talk to people and just being called weird for trying     do i just ignore it  i don t even dislike this coworker  ,0

does anyone else get angry when they feel  forced  to talk  something happened on wednesday and i m still feeling angry and wound up about it now  whenever i think about it  someone kept coming up to me and saying  talk to me  find something to talk about   and when i responded  i don t know what to say  or  i don t feel like talking   they ignored me and continued asking me really irrelevant questions like  so what have you been up to recently     i think i m angry about feeling  pushed  into talking  like i m not a performing seal that s just gonna entertain you on your command  if you want to talk  either find someone who is interested in having a conversation  or talk to yourself  the quieter i was and the shorter the responses i gave  the more they push  this isn t a one off  this person constantly does it  maybe they have autism  i don t mean that in a nasty way  nor am i trying to use  autism  as an insult   i don t know  but i m considering reporting them for harassment    i hate feeling like i  have  to talk  i only talk when i have something to say  i regret not screaming at the person to leave me alone  argh  i wish i could stop feeling angry about this   edit  i m not by any means antisocial or misanthropic  there are lots of people that i willingly participant in small talk with  because they don t force me to talk when i don t want to  and they listen to what i say and respect my space   edit  wow i didn t expect this to blow up  thanks all for your validation and advice  ,0
    lessons  if they don t message you back  it s better to assume the best  not the worst  maybe they re not interested or maybe they re just busy  which narrative serves you best  a while back i posted this   today i turn     here are    lessons i ve learned about being better with people  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments czah t today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned    r socialskills liked it      i liked this so much ive already started to refer to this as  jeffs    laws of unspoken communications  in my head  lol     u roastedmarshmellow      past posts    just  go to this post and click on any number       https   www reddit com r socialskills comments czah t today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned   to go to that number s in depth post                               our lesson for today           if they don t message you back  it s better to assume the best not the worst  maybe they re not interested or maybe they re just busy  which narrative serves you best   re read lessons    and        note    sometimes people are just  not  interested in being your friend  dating you  meeting up for coffee  etc   and that s fine    it s   not   reasonable to expect      of people to click with you    this post is more about influencing your own internal  operating system  to help you get better social results in most  not all  situations   also  we re just using  being left on read  as an example  but these lessons apply to a wide variety of social situations       you check your phone for the   th time    still no message back    why would they leave you on read   what the hell did you do wrong   you might start making assumptions      they probably don t want to talk to be because                  does this mean they re not investing in our friendship     assumptions are pretty understandable    as humans  we try really hard to read between the lines and get as much information as possible in most situations   but it s important to see assumptions for what they are  making up a complete story from incomplete information   with a healthy dose of mind reading   and because of our negativity bias      of the time  the stories we tell ourselves are not helpful   time to flip the script    and we re going to use a couple of earlier lessons in this series to help us do it             lesson    https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dnvkdc today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned    no one can mind read  they have no clue what you re thinking  you have no idea what they are thinking     this is a mindset that really helped me as i was improving my social skills    repeat after me   i can t read other people s minds  other people can t read my mind   this is really powerful   if you ve ever been in a situation where you think you know what others are thinking about you  and you let those very real feeling hallucinations influence how you behave  then you ve experienced this first hand   here are some rapid fire examples where people can t read your mind    you walk into a new job  people can t read your mind    you enter a party  people can t read your mind    you sit down for a job interview  people can t read your mind   also    you walk into a new job  you can t read your new co worker s mind    you enter a party  you can t read the host s mind    you sit down for a job interview  you can t read your interviewer s mind    you re left on read  you can t read that person s mind   i think mind reading comes from people s discomfort with the unknown  we as humans want to know as much about any situation as we can   and with social situations  we re trying to fit in  or now screw up   so mind reading is a natural tactic to try to reduce that  information gap   what s the solution  control only what you can control  if you can t read minds  what else could you do    you walk into a new job  introduce yourself to as many new people as you can   keep in mind    and    from above    you enter a party  say hi to the host and ask them who you should meet at the party    you sit down for a job interview  since you can t mind read  the best you can do is answer and ask questions about the position  and make small talk with the interviewer  this also applies after the interaction  since mind reading is out    after   hours  if they still haven t messaged you back  create a positive narrative   maybe they re just busy     you can t think   oh  i bet my new co worker think i m weird      you can t think   i bet the host thought i was too quiet      you can t think   i bet the interviewer hated me      you can t think these things because you can t mind read   no one can     action step    if you catch yourself mind reading  gently remind yourself that no one can read minds  you can only control what you can control              lesson    https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dqkyst    lessons ive learned about being better with    it s possible to view the same event   different ways  ex  you say  hi   they brush past you instead of saying  hi   negative view   they must be mad at me   positive view   they must be preoccupied  they probably didn t hear me      lets play a game to help put you in the right frame of mind   in       a picture of a blue black or white gold dress took the internet by storm prompting     million tweets in    hours    google link   blue or gold dress   https   www google com search q glod or blue dress oq glod or blue dress aqs chrome    i  j l      j j  sourceid chrome ie utf     people were seeing two different colors of the same dress  some people could even flip flop between seeing blue or gold   which do you see  blue or gold   just like that dress  you can view social events through two different lenses   when things happen to us  we can t change the event  but we can nudge how we perceive the event   let s look at an example     event  you text someone that you re romantically interested in  they don t respond and it s been several hours     here are two ways you could interpret that event       why didn t they reply   what did i say wrong          they are probably just busy  it likely has nothing to do with me    two options for how you view the world which option will help you perform better socially   option     i did this exact thing when my future wife and i first started talking   most people default to a negative interpretation of events  i think this is because humans have a built in negativity bias   negative things have a greater effect on our psychological state than neutral or positive things  rick hanson phd has some great insight on this      action step    when you find yourself making an automatic negative interpretation of a social event or situation  flip the switch the other way in your mind    ask yourself    how could i interpret this differently    or even   what if the opposite were true     take   minutes and think of one recent situation when you made an automatic negative interpretation   how could you have interpreted that event in a more positive way   this is a borderline superpower because everything is related   if you start viewing events through a more positive lens  you ll have better social interactions because people will love being around a positive person   over time  adopting a positive mindset will filter through everything other social skill you might learn   you ll start doing this naturally  and it will become your new normal      in the comments      take a social situation youve had recently that could be viewed negatively how could you imagine the best case scenario  are you making any unhelpful assumptions or mind reading            also    something i see a lot with people who are trying to improve their social skills is needing help with group conversations   i created this audio guide to join   enjoy group conversations you might listen to  https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html   in this audio guide youll learn    genuinely connect with anyone about any topic   how to jump into a conversation that has no opening   how to get out of your head and stay present in group conversations    and more  word for word scripts  body language while joining a group  etc    enjoy   https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html  ,0
hung out with the girl i like today i am so tired because i was so nervous and i am      drained now but i did alright i think  she sent me a smiley face so maybe that went well  i m just not used to that kinda life because i m a complete introvert and she s always out and about so it was interesting  i wasn t as open as i wanted to be but i was good and felt relaxed  it was actually really nice and it just felt like i have nothing to worry about    i m starting to understand how it feels to relax and just enjoy life and the moments  i still have some more work to put in to get to where i really want to be but i m glad i had that experience today  who knows if it was just a normal day for her or not but it was definitely a special day for me  just took a dab and i m just sitting in bed enjoying the moments and appreciating social interaction when i used to dread it  i felt for once like i wanted to let the day go on forever instead of constantly wondering when the other person would be wanting to head back home bc i start to get too anxious and want it to end   i know this is probably a small and normal thing for most people but i learned a lot today and loved the experience ,0
are there unwritten rules of texting  i didnt want to title this  always texting first  but thats one of the finer points here  anyway     im quite new to the social media scene  it seems that if i dont text people  they wont text me  when i do text them i get a warm  welcoming response and we chat for a while  what bums me out is  if i dont initiate  they certainly wont  it makes me feel like they dont actually want to text me   however  whenever i see these people in the flesh  they spend a good portion of the time texting  so its not like they dont text   granted i have only a few friends  most of whom are new and are legitimately awesome    and  granted  im sure they have bigger  better things to do than text me  no doubt they also have much cooler  much more interesting people to talk to   i feel like im missing something vital  like theres a rite of passage i never completed  maybe my life is too boring and everyone knows im usually doing nothing  so why bother asking  maybe i havent hit a required social cue that indicates im worth texting  maybe ive become that guy who you dont have to text because hell text you  maybe ive answered too quickly too many times and i look desperate which puts people off immediately   and  maybe  my friends are too shy to initiate  maybe  like me  theyre worried about interrupting someones day  maybe theyre inundated with so many other people texting them that they could really do without an extra person  maybe they have their own set of unwritten rules  maybe they just have nothing to say to me  maybe were not close enough yet   and  maybe  just maybe  im investing a little too much into this  im not sure if id actually want people to text me nonstop all day long anyway   though its hard not to when texting has become a primary means of communication that no one seems eager to do with you  ,0
talk  please talk  i was the quiet girl in school  i was also the one with crippling anxiety and depression  i was no stranger to backhanded compliments and people  even teachers  believing i genuinely could not speak  well  i could  i just chose not to because i was afraid of drawing attention to myself  and plus  i didn t have proper social skills to understand what was appropriate to say in certain situations  i had no real friends  and yes  it was my fault  because i never bothered to talk to anyone  and i pushed away anyone that got too close  i was afraid of getting hurt  but i only hurt myself by choosing to stay silent   tomorrow is my   th birthday  and last week  i learned to talk  i learned to initiate conversations on my own without mommy pushing me to  go over there and make friends    i started driving school the beginning of this month  it was the first time i d been in anything close to a public school setting in years  i d been a hermit for at least   years prior to this month  i wasn t nervous about being in public  because i felt like it was time to start becoming independent and be a member of society  i was just nervous about not being able to  fit in  because of my lack of social skills and inability to hold a conversation    i m in a class of     we re all teens  the first week  i was learning new names and matching them to faces  some made groups of friends and others were already friends before enrolling  i sit in the back row with   other teens at my table so i can observe the class  at the end of the first day  my teacher asked me how it was  and i stayed silent until i found the courage to respond to him  and i said   it was fine  i m more of an observer  you might not get a lot out of me    i didn t know that was a lie   the second week came around and i watched a girl solve a rubix cube in two minutes flat  the next day  i bet her a dollar if she could do it in one minute and    seconds  i was surprised that i actually asked her  normally we just sat and waited in silence until class started since we are usually the firsts to arrive  she smiled at me and won the bet  and we eventually got to talking more often about our lives and such    she s gay like me  it turns out  and she loves to talk about her girlfriend  now we talk every day  and we walked to the convenience store together yesterday and were complaining about our classmates while laughing  just so happens that we have a lot in common  i am much more talkative in class and i just might be sad once it s over    i have a friend after not having one for     ever  and it s all because i developed enough social skills to speak  please please  if you are afraid to speak because you think you may not fit in  i want you to try  try it slow  say hi to someone you think you could get along with  see where it goes  if it goes good  that s great  if not  pick yourself up and try again  you have nothing to lose    never allow fear to hold you back  maybe it s not fear  maybe it s just your lack of skills  but either way  if you try  you will improve  and you may find yourself enjoying things  i used to be miserable because i was too scared to speak  thinking i would say something dumb or people would hate me  now i m finally able to fit in because i found my courage  it was never other people disliking me  it was my own fear and unwillingness to try that prevented me    i still need to work on my mumbling and pausing for too long  but i ll get there  and so will you  if we all just try  we can make it  so please  if you re going to school tomorrow  say hi to a classmate  if you re going to work  ask your coworker how their day has been    talk  please talk  your social skills may thank you for it    ,0
my social anxiety story and some tips that may help you howdy friends  this is a repost from  r socialanxiety with additional thoughts and reflections at the end   first  my backstory   struggled with social anxiety for years  i couldnt even look a waitress in the eye to order a meal at a restaurant  it was paralyzing and my face would get so hot id break into a sweat  it was even worse because  i knew they could see my face getting red just as much as i could feel it    girls used to call me  tomato mode  back when i was a freshman in high school    it wasnt until i was introduced to slam poetry did i finally gain sufficient confidence and momentum to overcome my anxiety and swing things in the other direction  it changed my life  and made me realize my social anxiety doesnt have to define me  its also led to a lifelong fascination with public speaking  communication and historys strong communicators   started a youtube channel tonight inspired by a conversation from earlier today with a friend whose struggling with social anxiety and recorded some episodes detailing a few helpful tips ive learned over the years that stuck  you can subscribe to that by visiting my profile  or just dm me for the link   this is a not for profit project for me  rather  it was born out of a genuine desire to help folks with this  my wife and i are expecting a little one soon  and thus  i find myself thinking about these things and how best to impart this information so my little one doesnt have to suffer like i did overcoming it should they have it     starting small  posture  smile  gaze  breathing  pausing  minimize fidgeting       posture and mood are linked  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed            so a confident posture is a simple  strong staring point   this is akin to a quick victory  which can help you build positive  psychological momentum   act like youre trying to hold something between your shoulder blades   smile warmly  softly  naturally  be a sunrise  and take a deep breath   its okay to pause and collect yourself before responding or speaking      not pausing and blurting out whatever  hurts  your credibility      while pausing  collecting yourself  then speaking  adds  to your credibility      you wont sound stupid  quite the opposite  more thoughtful    dont worry about your eyes spinning around while youre thinking   rather  your eyes move as you collect yourself than your hands feet etc     this other tip i call  the charlie chaplin principle  and its about preparing      before any kind of big social event  i just had a baby shower  i act out how i want to act in the mirror   its kind like private  silent acting or miming to yourself  because theres no speaking    its really just a  mannerisms drill  where i focus on breathing  posture  smile  etc    first  it helps with  greasing the gears  so you dont have to try and just flip a switch when you walk in   next  it also looks  quite ridiculous   and tends to make me laugh  which is another huge plus   why  because laughing loosens you up even further  and makes it all less stressful    icebreaking    i call this the churchill principle because i love winston churchill     call out whats unique about somebody thats not immediately obvious   calling it out  if its sincerely not obvious  shows your thoughtful  which is an immediate win   on my channel i give an example of a disinterested store clerk i was forced to bargain with   so i started the conversation off by saying  genuinely  how unique and cool their necklace was   turns out it was from her grandmother from croatia and there was a  fascinating  backstory      wear something unique i wear a gold ring or a hat like churchill did      this helps other people with doing the opposite with you   nice hat            as an aside  this highlights another point  that conversation is reciprocal         chances are youre not the only one whose anxious in the conversation         and starting off with a gentle  unique observation is  disarming for all parties    so  when in doubt  call out something not obvious but unique or ask questions   develop a  curiosity for all things  so you always have questions to ask    other important considerations after some additional thought       conversation and friendship is a  reciprocal  arrangement  not just about you    so reframe your thoughts from  no one wants to be my friend  to  say     how can i be a better friend   or  how can i add value to this relationship     communication  just like exercise  improves with ongoing  deliberate practice and warm up    as i mentioned in the backstory  i was practically dragged into slam poetry and it saved my life      what can you force yourself into that requires public speaking  while minimizing the stakes     in my case  i lived in no where new jersey but traveled to nyc to do my live poetry   that way  if i made a fool of myself   i knew id never see any of those people again    upsides of this  an often understanding and supportive crowd  confidence  peer group  anyway  thanks for reading and please pm me or visit the link in my profile to subscribe to my channel  that way i know if it s worth it to keep making more guides like this  cheers  ,0
how to make any conversation meaningful   find it vs fake it    what would happen if you were talking to someone you d just met and they told you they were a tax accountant   you d say  oh cool   follow it with some small talk and then get yourself stuck on a topic you don t really care about  right  like this     what do you do as a tax accountant       oh just a lot of looking over receipts and making spreadsheets       so you must be pretty good with excel       uhh  yeah  i guess i m pretty good at it  i did a course on it last week actually       nice  i can use it a bit but i don t really use it that often     riveting stuff   want to know why this conversation is going nowhere  it s because you re pretending to be interested  internally you re thinking  how do i change the topic     but externally you re digging for details that you don t even want   you ll never truly connect with anyone that way  because people can tell when you re only faking interest  or just being  polite   they don t want to be in that conversation either  because it feels forced and empty for both of you   so what do you do     stop pretending    when you run out of small talk  stop digging into details that you don t care about  stop asking questions that you don t actually want the answer to  stop talking shit for the sole purpose of keeping the conversation going   the goal of a conversation is not simply to fill silence  it s to connect with the other person  so if all you re trying to do is fill silence  without truly being interested in what you re talking about  you re going to make it awkward   if your own words bore you  they sure as hell won t excite the other person  so don t say them  give your brain a chance to find something that will actually make the conversation interesting for both of you     when small talk runs out  find something you re genuinely curious about    you ll reach a point in the conversation where you naturally run out of obvious  small talk  things to say  instead of faking interest and continuing to interrogate the other person  pause to find some aspect of the current topic that you re actually curious about  you can easily feed off of curiosity to keep a conversation going and take it to a deeper  more meaningful level   ask yourself  what am i genuinely excited or interested to learn here  to explore  to share   if you don t actually feel the curiosity  you haven t found the right topic yet   so what might spark your curiosity with the tax accountant  how about this   if you re interested in psychology and what motivates people to do what they do     you know what  i don t think i could do numbers all day   but i ve actually heard a few people say they love doing accounting  and i m really curious to know what it is they love about it  what am i missing       i have no idea  i don t always love my job   but i guess the one thing i do like is that you always know when you ve done your work right  because the numbers match up  and they never lie     now we re getting into meaningful territory  because you re not just pretending to be interested anymore  you ll feel much more confident and comfortable taking the conversation in this direction  and the other person will open up to your genuine curiosity     conversation examples    your co worker tells you it takes her an hour on the train to get to work every morning  after you say the obvious stuff  like  damn  it only takes me    minutes by car   or  where are you coming from    you run out of things to say   so what hidden aspect of her story sparks your curiosity   for me  interested in productivity   learning  it s this      what do you do with that time  because i always try to learn something when i travel  from books or audiobooks          a girl on a first date tells you she has a dog named barney  you say the stuff that comes easy  like  aww  what kind of dog   or  do you teach him tricks     but you don t have a dog so you don t know to go deeper on that topic   what are you genuinely excited or interested to explore here  to share   for me it s this  something i ve wondered about       i looked after my friend s dog a few times and it was always really needy and whiney and wouldn t leave me alone   so i m not sure if i d have the patience for a dog  what s it actually like when you have your own          a stranger at the gym tells you he wakes up  am every day to go for a run  you ve never really enjoyed running  you start with the obvious small talk   how long do you run for   or  where do you run   and then you get stuck   what are you curious to learn here   for me it s this  true story       man  i ve tried building both habits    running and waking up early    but i can never keep them up for more than a few days  how the hell do you stay motivated to keep doing it every day  like do you get to a point where you actually start to enjoy it     you don t have to always dig for the meaningful stuff like this in every sentence of every conversation  but whenever you feel like you re running out of small talk  don t fake interest   find it   if you want more actionable advice

i asked a stranger about their music today and wanted to share a lady in her car was stopped in the parking lot right next to me blasting music  i ask her about the song and we had a quick lil chat before she pulled off  best part was i wasnt nervous and my responses felt almost natural which is totally unusual  i was just happy and had no one to share it with ,0
talked to a girl im interested in and it cured my depression for a whole day  ive had a crush on her since high school but i never actually had the balls to make a move because my self esteem too was too damn low  and it still is    however last week i invited her to eat outside as she was spending a week in my city  she accepted   fast forward to that day  i arrived early and unprepared and just improvised my way through the whole interaction  managed to make her laugh a few times and i think that overall the interaction wasnt too cringy     but when she left  and i awkwardly waved her goodbye  and even though i didnt score anything there  i felt the best i have in months  for   h i forgot most of my problems  and my general incapacity at forming romantic relationships with the opposite sex  sometimes the friendzone is good enough  ,0

former shy here  i recently did a    day social experiment in which i talked to at least three strangers every day  heres what i learned   i did this for my blog which is all about self development  but self promotion makes me feel dirty and i am more interested in just helping you guys out on here  if anyone really wants the link i can post it    edit  someone asked  so here it is  http   andrewelsass com blog     small backstory  first    years of my life i was painfully shy  socially unconfident  had terrible self esteem  last     years i have become fascinated by self development and humans ability to change themselves into whoever they want to be  i did this project because i had recently moved to a new city for the third time in    months and frequently had conversations with old friends that were in similar situations and had no idea on how to construct a new social circle from scratch     my five biggest takeaways          pursue your passions     not surprisingly  of all the people i met  the ones i vibed with best were those that i had a mutual interest with from the beginning  be it crossfit  swing dancing  or hanging out in coffee shops   many in my generation seem to be under the impression that friends will just apparate like they did in grade school and college  sorry  but it s a different ball game now  building friendships takes consistent effort  it takes work  but that work can be made easier by going out and doing whatever it is you love most  or going out and trying a new hobby  i imagine volunteering and religious groups are also great ways to meet like minded people  do this enough and your world will become smaller and smaller  as the more you put yourself out into the community  the more you will begin to see the same people        hot and un bothered    one limiting belief i used to have towards starting conversations in public was that i would be bothering people  sure  there are times when this could be the case  but it is quickly learned when someone is genuinely busy and probably not in the mood to chit chat versus someone that is aimlessly killing time on their phone   how i like to think about it is this  if i were in that person s situation  and someone cheerful and confident started talking to me  would i be annoyed  or not mind at all       of the people i talked to were extremely polite back  people in general are nicer than we give them credit for  and the two or three people  out of     total  that ignored me or just said  yeah  and walked away  chances are they weren t worth my time trying to get to know them anyway  they themselves weren t very confident people  or who knows  maybe they were having the worst day of their life  or maybe they just didn t have anything to say  no harm  no foul    the amount of people that were even remotely  weirded out  by me i could probably count on one hand  and although i can come on strong  perhaps overcompensating slightly from my shy days  this happened even less than i would have predicted         quick on the draw    also reinforced  but still extremely important  turned out to be the power of not hesitating when starting conversations  no matter how anti social  socially awkward  whatever  someone paints themselves to be  they will never come off that way if they start a conversation  no  even just acknowledge someone  within the first three seconds that they are near them  this is a sign of assertiveness  of confidence  of power in a person   waiting not only rifles every excuse a person can think of not to say anything through their head  it also aggrandizes those beliefs that they aren t a confident person  are socially awkward  and all the other nonsense people tell themselves   the trick is acting so fast that the mind doesn t have time to tell the body all the reasons it shouldn t be doing this        the lonely socialites    the biggest surprise to me was not anything that i learned through any of the interactions  but instead from my existing friends  coincidentally through conversation with a few of my peers  not even always about the experiment  i learned that an extremely high percentage of them wished they were more social   it was a refreshing feeling to discover that becoming more social and personable was not something that only i was interested in  but was a struggle many people  especially in my age group  can relate to  a lot of these people  to me  seemed like socially active individuals  too  they just wait for someone else to make the first move  be that someone else        everyone and their brother      ultimately  the most important thing  again  is to talk to everyone  i can t state the importance of this enough  through chatting up random people i had a   hour conversation at a bar about life  the universe  and everything in between  i found out about a somewhat secret series of acoustic shows hosted by a small local blogger in my city  and also became pretty good friends with a neighbor in my apartment complex during this experiment    talking to everyone will make you happier  make you smarter  make you more confident  get you more friends  get you more dates  get you a better job  and make you see that the people of this world are inherently good   and because really  it only takes one person to change your life      to anyone that wishes they were more social  i highly recommend doing something like this  keep data  use stickk com  anything that will make you accountable  its about gaining momentum  and that momentum eventually turns into a habit     tl dr    do shit you are interested in  you arent annoying people  act fast  youre not alone  talk to  everyone   ,0
great advice for people  like myself  who feel like they never know what to say my therapist told me some simple but great advice on this  and honestly i feel like i can t really do it justice by writing about it here on reddit  but here goes  it basically goes as this  there is no right way to communicate socialize  it is different for everyone so saying that you don t know what to say is completely wrong  you can never  know  what to say  because if you knew what to say then you wouldn t really be communicating  or being yourself  you would just be a person trying to portray a character or idea that is not actually you being you  everyone communicates in their own way  and if you ever listen to other people talk to each other you would realize that their conversations are not as interesting as the media or tv make it seem like you have to be  i really don t think i did my therapist justice by writing this  because as i m reading it back it s not making as much sense as it makes in my head  plus i m a little drunk  but hopefully it helps at least one of you guys  also as a little side note  therapy is fantastic  and i couldn t recommend it enough  ,0

i    m  asked two girls for their numbers today at a theme park i m not super awkward when it comes to girls but i did something today for fun and i m really proud of myself for doing it  i was in busch gardens williamsburg for a school trip  some of my friends made a joke that i should ask some girls for their numbers and i brushed it off at the beginning  later on i saw a really cute girl so i said fuck it and did it  i got her snap  i don t think i creeped her out  and my female friends all said i looked really cute while doing it  later on my friends pointed out another girl so i asked and got her number as well  my blood was pumping and i was nervous and scared but now i m super excited  my friends also said i wasn t creepy about it i plan to casually text both of them later tonight   edit  uhh i said in the original that i was only there for a school trip so i ll probably never see these people again  and even if we hit it off over text i d probably also never hang out with them  soooooo  yeah  no hang outs  no relationship stuff  just a dude who found two girls really pretty and i guess that s all it needs to be  edit    am currently texting one  she lives quite far from me but that s okay  thanks for the positive responses from most of you    ,0
i fucking did it boys  i asked for her number  so there s this girl at my gym  i saw her working out once and we shared quite a few glances but nothing happened  the next day i find out that she works there  which i thought was a good thing since i d be able to see her more frequently  so i saw her a couple more times  and told myself i d approach her  but my dumbass pulled back every time    on to today  i hadn t been to the gym in a while since i was out of town for the holidays  and i d lost my access card so she had to make me a new one  she told me it would be ready by the time i finished  so this time i promised myself i wouldn t leave without approaching her  when i was done with my workout  i went up to the counter  interacted with her a bit    and i just thanked her and left    i literally left the gym  went outside  and thought to myself  no fucking way  i m getting this shit done  today   so  after overthinking the situation and playing it a million times in my head  i headed downstairs    she was already packing her stuff and getting ready to leave  so literally now or who knows when  i walked up to the counter  acting as cool as could be and not of my heart was beating at     bpm  and told her  by the way  this might seem out of the blue  but i think you re really cute and would love to get to know you better  is there any chance i could get your number   she said she has a boyfriend but we could go out and grab some food as friends  and wrote her number on a piece of paper with a smiley face    i don t know if i should consider this as a rejection  but i haven t felt so good in a very long while  remember people  the pain of rejection is acute  intense but brief   the pain of unknowing is chronic  won t be so blunt but it ll be nagging at you in the back of your head for god knows how long     i ve had my fair share of hookups  but nowhere near as i could have had since i ve never had to put much effort or gone out of my way for a girl  part of the reason was this fear of rejection  but i swear the sense of relief and satisfaction is unbeatable  any and all advice on how to handle the situation will be much appreciated    ,0
 tip  when meeting someone for the  st time  think that the other person is more scared than you are      this one has helped me entering college or even ordering coffee at a starbucks  i am a very shy person because i got to some problems that dont relate here   about the tip  it was given by my father and it goes something like this   when you are in line to order a meal at a fast food or when they introduce you to people  instead of thinking  im shy or the impression you will do to the other person  just remember that the other person may  and most of the times will  be more shy so dont worry  just remember you are worth a lot  and keep it cool  being friendly so you dont make the other shy person feel bad    and if for some reason he doesn t seem shy then don t let their looks or ways of talking intimate you   you may not have a boy girlfriend or you ain t the most successful person in the world but you may be worth it  just don t know it yet  that s why upon meeting someone for the first time think you are more brave that the other one  otherwise you will look shy and cause a bad impression   ,0
being shy can be a sign of pride  you might be shy because you are maintaining a  perfect image  in front of people  and you dont say anything so people will not know you   when you are with people  just focus on being good and helpful  their opinion of you should not matter    if they see a weakness in you  then you have a weakness  thats all  it should not be hidden   and you are not  too good  to be rejected  whatever the case may be  if you approach another person with some kind of proposal  may be invitation  friendship  relationship etc   its ok to be rejected  you are not perfect and dont fit everyones preferences   in short  dont be shy and quiet when you have things to say or any requests  be nice to people but since you are not a perfect human being dont expect to be accepted by everyone in the world  ,0

does anyone else just feel worthless  at this point  it s not my lack of social skills hindering me  it s my lack of worth  in fact  if i was worth anything  i d have social skills  human beings are innately social and making connections with others should come as naturally as breathing  as i look around me and see others making lifelong friends with strangers  effortlessly falling in love  laughing and joking etc it s confirmed for me  i can t even call myself human  how could i when i m missing such a vital part of it   i ve been an outcast all of my life  i remember being in pre k and feeling like i couldn t connect with any of the kids  at worst i was bullied  at best i was used as an easy backup plan  every time i thought i d finally made a friend  they would inevitably show me that i didn t mean much to them  i was      the kid teen who ate lunch in the library  sometimes in the dirty bathroom stall     one thing that i am lucky in is the fact that i m female and not unattractive so i ve always gotten male attention   i say i m  lucky  for this because i m aware that some other social outcasts  mainly men  go through life without even this  it s always been obvious that     of these guys only saw me as an easy target but i at least coped with knowing that they wanted to talk to me    this will sound melodramatic but i really feel as though some people just aren t meant to be in this world  or maybe just there for others to abuse  and i m one of them  ,0
ill just drop this here and let you think about it  ,0
i finally talked to a really attractive girl today  for a large portion of my life i ve dealt with severe social anxiety and depression and in the last year i ve really been working hard to flip that  i ve been a long time lurker and taking everyone s experiences and advice and putting it to use as well as hanging around with social animals  i ve worked up to easily making small talk with other guys and girls but really attractive girls really got to head until today  i m pretty damn sure she has been checking me out since classes started three weeks ago so i finally manned the fuck up and talked to her   so hopefully i can keep it going for weeks to come  sorry if this was a bit of ramble  i m just so happy i did it  and honestly anyone can do it  you just gotta slowly work your way up the social ladder and work on yourself and it ll come naturally  ,0
not everyone is nice i was at a party with my friends and one of them had a new gf and we were talking to her and some of her friends when one of her other friends came up to her and gave me the stink eye and said   insert name here  is this your new boyfriend  in a tone of voice as if to say  why would you go out with him he s ugly  and her friend said no and then she gave me another look as if to say  i m not in the wrong you are for standing there  and the entitlement of that last look pissed me off enough to make this post but it also wasn t that fun to be humiliated on front of all my friends as well as people i don t even know  just be careful out there and try to distance yourself from these disgusting people ,0
does anyone else feel like they re a little  off  socially  but everyone is just being nice to you because they don t want to call you out on it and seem like a jerk  i ve felt like this all my life  even in the past few years as my social skills have dramatically improved  i know there have to be others who feel the same way  right  ,0
am i the only one who is closed off at times open at other times  i can t be the only one who is like this  there are times when i want to share everything about myself to someone  and other times when i don t want anyone to know anything about me  am i the only one like this  if so  is this a bad thing  if not  why  ,0
terribly shy and evidently unapproachable   please send help  im   f in my  th year of college  computer science  and i have literally no friends  ive learned to genuinely enjoy my own company  and im proud of that  but living in near isolation for   years is getting to me  theres a lot of junk to unpack with me  ill try to stay on topic   i   like most everyone under the age of      struggle with my own flavor of social anxiety  im good at public speaking and task oriented conversations  but leisurely chit chat makes me freeze up  i have no idea how to be casual with people i dont know and  by extension  have no idea how to approach new people  especially people my own age   but wait it gets better   ive been told by a number of fleeting acquaintances that i came off as aloof  stuck up  and narcissistic until they actually talked to me  because of this i think something about my outward disposition is making me unapproachable  but i dont know what it is  i think my paranoid insecurities must be bleeding through    either way  this leads me to my question    how can i figure out whats making me unapproachable  and then how do i go about making myself  more  approachable   im so lonely you guys     ,0
jalt just a little tip   if you want to ask a question  dont use why  there is judgment hidden in the word and people will get defensive something that i remembered from my teacher who teaches communication   she explained that if you use the word why people will see it as if you are judging them and will get defensive    so instead of asking   why did you do that   why is it like that    ask   what is the reason that you did that   how did it become like that      x   b   i dont know if there are better examples because english is not my primary language   ,0
how to deal with men who bully women they aren t interested in  yet act all nervous around other men  i ve encountered this type of bully a lot at work  the guy would be very psychologically abusive towards female coworkers who he isn t interested in  and clings to the female coworkers that he is interested in  he would also become really anxious and nervous when in the presence of another man  he s only nice to the coworkers who have boyfriends or husbands  and the coworkers who are older than he is  he s really scrawny  so that might explain why he s more of a psychological bully than a physical one  other than the obvious legal implications   how do i deal with a toxic coworker like this  ,0
my most humiliating social interaction from hs still haunts me one of the most humiliating moments of my life was during spanish class in freshman year of high school  we were learning comparisons  more  less  the most  the least  and literally out of nowhere the loudest girl in class says  smolqt    is the quietest person in class  in spanish  everyone started laughing and agreeing  people started saying  yeah  i think she hates us because she never talks   even the teacher was laughing  not to mention i was sitting in the front row where the class was split in two groups facing each other  so literally everyone could see me    yeah maybe it is dramatic  but i was absolutely humiliated  i wanted to sink into the ground and never be seen again  and i didn t try and prove everyone wrong  for the rest of high school i was the painfully shy  quiet girl  people thought i was rude or stuck up and i had very few friends   it wasn t until college that i tried to get out of my shell  even then i had a lot of trouble and i felt terribly insecure  i didn t really make many real friends until the end of my  nd year   and even now freshly out of college i m just starting to embrace my quietness and introversion as a good thing  i m a great listener and i m very introspective  i do have a good group of friends that accept me for who i am and i love that so much  but sometimes i m still haunted by my former self   i ve gotta see this as fuel towards getting better  instead of a way to damper my day  i know my    yo self would be proud of me  so i gotta keep that with me going forward   edit  thanks everyone for your stories  encouragement  and constructive criticism  yesterday was a bad day  and on bad days i tend to think way too much about negative memories  my story was a common theme throughout my adolescence  i d be talked over  dismissed  embarrassed  which is partially my fault for not sticking up for myself   and left out  being bullied in middle school changed me from a happy and social little girl to a reclusive and reserved teen in high school  my self worth was at an all time low    but i m not that person anymore  i sometimes struggle with these things but there s no point in holding onto these memories as a weight  but rather to push myself forward  ,0
anyone else    or older and unsure of their own interests  i listen to music  watch videos on youtube  etc  but i feel like i lack actual interest in what i m exposed to  nothing really captivates my attention  maybe i m trying too hard  ,0
people are usually nice to me  and will talk to me   but only of i talk to them first  people are also usually fine with me tagging along somewhere if i ask  but it seems like they only let me join them out of pity or to avoid being rude  i never get invited to things  what can i do  it always seems like i have  friends   but arent friends people who actively want to hang out with you  should i just accept that no one actively wants me around  and just insert myself into group conversations or outings to avoid loneliness  is there something wrong with me  ,0
successful job interview i m so proud of myself right now  i just came back from a job interview where i was interviewed by   people  i thought it was going to be only one but when i got there it was   lol thankfully i managed to stay calm though  in the end one of the interviewers congratulated me on my communications skills  i couldn t have expected a better compliment  even if i don t get the job  this experience had a huge impact on my self confidence and showed me that i am  in fact  making progress   edit  thank you so much for your support everyone  you guys are the best ,0
i feel to awkward to say bye and i forget manners sometimes it s a weird neurological thing for me but i get super awkward when i initiate saying bye  which is why i don t do it often besides the host before i leave    it s stupid really and i don t know why my brain makes me feel that initiating  bye  is mentally hard thing to do  it s easier to just slip and leave quietly  i don t feel worked up if someone initiated bye first  but its not like i m going to say bye to other people other than the host and that person who greeted me    i get guilty when my friend told me i was being disrespectful for not saying bye  but honestly  i forget sometimes because sometimes my awkwardness takes over and i forget  its not an excuse and i m still trying  even saying hi to other people at a family social setting is awkward but i m getting better    i would also like to note that i struggle with my manners because my parents don t really use manners on me so i don t do the same back  i also get awkward with them sometimes when i even feel pain saying thanks because then they say i can give my thanks by doing something they want me to do  but still though  its not like i m around them all the time to be this way  i ve been somewhat social  trying to me  and i still struggle  i don t know why and idk why i feel this  awkwardness of pain  i take psych meds and i ll probs have to schedule an appointment soon   does anyone else relate  i feel like it s just me  ,0

a trick i learned to help with low motivation hey guys  this is my first post here  just wanted to share a trick i learned to get myself motivated  which can be difficult  the trick is to just accomplish some sort of task at the start of the day  whether that be making my bed  walking my dogs  etc  i feel that this just sets me up for success by telling my brain that today is a day to get shit done  ,0
i genuinely cant understand why people want me around this isnt necessarily a self deprecating rant  ive had those moments but not this time  its not out of self hatred  i think besides my issues  im an okay person but im also sensitive and easily hurt  im to anxious so i barely speak  my only friend groups and i have little in common  my life is boring or depressing  neither of which makes for a good conversation   still ive had my friends invite me to hang out  or play games  or even miss me  and i appreciate it but i just  i dont understand why  i never have anything good to contribute to discussions  im always behind in games we play  i dont make good jokes  most times i get drowned out by everyone  im quiet  im not interesting  im not doing anything at all to make people want me around  so why would they  i just cant understand it   why would you want to hang out with someone quiet  easily hurt  boring depressing and bad at video games  what are friendships made of  edit  i realized my typos caused some confusion  fixed to clarify that i dont think im trying to put myself down  i just want an answer to the  why  for some reason ,0

  u mercuriah    this deserves more gold than i will ever be able to afford     u whoahkay   over the next few weeks  we ll go in depth with each of the    points  i ll include action steps to help you get better with people    post    https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dnvkdc today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned     post    https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dqkyst    lessons ive learned about being better with                               our   for this week          no need to overthink eye contact  make eye contact for a few seconds  glance away  rinse and repeat          small talk is necessary  it helps you move from lighter topics to deeper topics so that you can build rapport           during small talk  avoid the  interrogation trap   balance questions with observations   great chance to give a meaningful compliment                                    no need to overthink eye contact  make eye contact for a few seconds  glance away  rinse and repeat     my friend shawn is an olympic gold medalist in eye contact   years ago i remember riding in the backseat of his car as he was driving a friend and i around    i noticed that he made a point to make eye contact with me through the rear view mirror as he spoke to me   the result  i always felt like shawn was present in our conversations even though i wish he had kept his eyes on the road a bit more  lol   when we make good eye contact  we help people feel connected to us  and we re more present in interactions   eye contact is important  and also easy to overthink     should i make eye contact with their left eye or right eye       should i look between their eyes       action steps   here s what i d recommend to gradually make better eye contact     level      make eye contact long enough to tell what color the other person s eyes are      level      make eye contact while the other person is speaking     level      make eye contact while you are speaking     level      make eye contact while you are speaking and break eye contact when the other person does  only resume eye contact when they look back in your direction   eye contact is best done while also using the  slight smile and resting happy face from last week s post  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments dqkyst    lessons ive learned about being better with    eye contact done with a neutral or resting sad face will not go as well  try at your own risk   level   is my friend shawn did  it works    it wont be easy the first few times  but thats okay  the more you practice eye contact  the more youll stand out to people     over time  just like any skill  it will become your new normal   common eye contact question     what if  they dont look away they dont blink they think im a psycho     answer  doubtful this will happen  important to test things in the real world before thinking of reasons why they wont work                                    small talk is necessary  it helps you move from lighter topics to deeper topics so that you can build rapport     when you turn on the stove to boil water  it takes a few minutes for the water to heat up enough to start boiling    many people will think things like     ugh  i hate small talk  i prefer having a deeper conversation    they are missing the point of small talk    small talk is getting you to a place where you can go deeper  not only does small talk have a point  it s a crucial basis for building a relationship   let s say your goal is making new friends at a new job   here s what that process might look like on a linear  and oversimplified  way  this make happen over a few weeks or months   introduce yourself to coworker   make small talk   build rapport   deeper conversation   make plans to meet up outside of work    you may need to make small talk several times over a few weeks    then  rapport develops and deeper topics can be introduced  those deeper topics can come up easily because of all the small talk you ve had before that point      systems beat goals    wanting more more friends is a goal   making small talk with people in your life is a system    a goal is a destination on a map   a system is a car that will get you to that goal   i m willing to bet that most people who are friends with people started out by making small talk with them first    if you make an effort to make more small talk  you ll have more people in your life who are  on the road  to being friends with you    note  more goes into making friends than small talk   this post has some good info on moving from acquaintance to friends  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  e wd  ive seen posts asking how can i make more friends      action step    if you re someone who outcome driven  you want more friends  for example  make small talk with   people in your life this week that you normally wouldn t have    could be someone at work   could be the person sitting behind you in class   could be the barista at your coffee shop   the objective here isn t to get  any  specific outcome  the objective is just to do it  if you ve made their day    better  great   number    will help you move from lighter topics to deeper topics by making observations                                         during small talk  avoid the  interrogation trap   balance questions with observations   great chance to give a meaningful compliment     have you ever asked a few too many insightful questions only to watch as your conversational partners eyes glaze over and they lustfully eye the open window as an escape hatch   the issue could be that youve fallen into the  interrogation trap    its crucial to balance questions and observations   heres what that might look like in practice     sam     this week has been crazy  i worked    hours on one project  when i close my eyes  i see spreadsheets      you     wow  you must be really dedicated to getting stuff done    here  you were able to pay sam a meaningful compliment while making an observation about his statement   with social skills  there are very few hard and fast rules   however  you should try to roughly       balance questions you ask and observations you give   this will help you avoid the  interrogation trap    we dont want the other person feeling like they are being interviewed     action step   good observations sometimes start with phrases like  so you       the basic framework is   so you    observation about what they just said  or what their statement means about them   so you must enjoy cooking        so you have been working really hard on this project    in your next conversation  make one observation where you d typically ask a question                                in the comments      which one of these have you struggled with    which one do you think you could take action on this next week      next week             keep a running list of social wins  when you have a great interaction  make people laugh with a joke  etc  write it down  next time you re feeling unsure  look over your list to remind yourself that you have been successful in the past           try not to interrupt  if you accidentally interrupt  say  you were saying   and bring up the last thing they said to get them back on track   this shows that you were listening you were listening  right            listening is so key  listen and try to come up with observations and questions that show that you are      engaged      next step     something i see a lot with people who are trying to improve their social skills is needing help navagating group conversations   i created this audio guide to join   enjoy group conversations you might check out  https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html   in this audio guide youll learn    how to genuinely connect with anyone on any topic   how to jump into a conversation that has no opening   how to get out of your head and stay

is it weird that i smile randomly in public  i can be thinking of nothing in particular and then suddenly get the urge to smile  i can t control it  i ve tried biting my cheeks to stop it  but it makes me laugh even harder because i can only imagine how ugly my facial expression must look to others    sometimes i ll just be checking out at the register and i start grinning from ear to ear  i feel like it either freaks people out or they think i m laughing at them  im usually not    trying to hold in laughs usually results in weird unintentional sounds and if me smiling wasn t obvious before  it definitely is now    edit  spacing ,0

  years of self improvements paid off  this is the success story of how   years of self improvement paid off with someone unexpected   my old high school crush             i was a shy deaf introvert with a cochlear implant  my speaking skills were not great and i didnt have much experience socializing with hearing people growing up in a deaf school  i was also a new kid to a noisy school where i cant hear anything  i first met this girl when my captioner  sitting in back of room  decided to chat with her and introduced us to each other  we were     we quickly became friends in classes we shared with each other              i fell for her hard  she was my very first crush  but my communication skills were bad and i ended up chasing her  i came across as desperate  she was returning my long texts with one or two words  i then tried to ask her out to bowling  but found out she had a crush on a guy at the alley  my heart was broken and i was tired of her lack of effort              i stopped texting her and avoided her  i was diagnosed with depression and became obese due to poor eating habits  we ran into each other once at football game  but that was it               we ran into each other at high school graduation and return to the same room to get our stuff  we hugged each other and she told me that  well see each other again   that didnt happen for few years              i was a mess  ugly  obese  and depressed by the time i go to college  i joined a club sport team and lost    pounds to normal weight  i finally broke out of my shell and found a hearing friend circle  i spent nights looking up how to be more social  reading these little tips on self improvement  changed how i dressed  no more sweatpants   and watched bunch of movies for culture references  i hired a counselor and learned how to manage my mental health  i also discovered my love of hiking mountains              i found a hobby in photography and became really good at it  i was doing well in classes and socializing with more people  went to the gym often               big challenges came  i started to struggle balancing everything  i was doing poorly in couple classes  i wasnt getting playing time in my club sport team  my friends were drifting from me  i got rejected by a girl i was interested in  etc  after   years of absence  my depression came creeping back in  it was tough  but i distracted myself by starting to travel more regionally with my camera  one day  i remembered it was my former crushs birthday so i texted her to see how she was doing  surprisingly  she asked to see me for lunch during our break  we ate chicken wings and caught up on our lives  but that was it  were living like    hours from each other so we didnt keep in touch after our quick catch up lunch               things i were struggling with fell apart completely  i got couple ds in school  i quit my club sport team  my friends isolated me out of their group  i had my worst ever depression episode  it was a miserable last semester of college  but i graduated  i did it  then i moved away from my home state for my first job to start over again  i was forced to re learn how to socialize  how to make myself presentable  and to find confidence in myself all over again  i also traveled across the country  seeing    states in one summer and a total solar eclipse              i finally caved and started to date different girls online for first time in my life  my job was okay  i traveled internationally for first time and saw northern lights  but still  i was not satisfied  i didnt like what i was doing  my dates were going nowhere  i was by myself away from my family in a different state  my depression crippled me again so i hired a therapist  i kept asking my parents for money to pay off my rising bills  it was another challenging time  in december of       i was feeling lonely before my holiday travel back home where my family and friends were  couple months before this  my old crush added me on snapchat out of blue so i figured id finally send her something  after two days  she sent a snap back  we quickly moved over to texting  i told her i was in town visiting and asked her if she want to go for drinks with me  now  heres a thing   me at    had no confidence to ask a girl like her out to anywhere  but me at    had no problem and hesitation to ask her out for drinks at a bar  i no longer see her as a crush  but as a person id like to hang out and have fun catching up with  she quickly accepted my offer and  to my surprise  called every bar in the city to ask about their noise level so i can hear her with my cochlear implant  it felt good she still cared little things about me after   years  few days after christmas  we met for first time in few years  she then brought the first round of drinks for us and we moved to a quiet corner  we ended up talking for   hours talking about life  with us taking turns on buying drinks  she introduced me to few new drinks  we laughed at old memories from our high school days  we talked about the uncertainty of future  she was amazed at how i was still hearing her at a loud bar  cochlear implant tech improved a lot in   years   she also commented about significant improvements i made on my speaking skills  my outgoing personality  how i broke out of my shell  how cute i am now  and more  it felt good  we ended the evening with heart to heart conversation about romantic relationships  she was dealing with lot of terrible guys and i was getting over a girl i recently dated  she said well find someone for us one day  we hugged for a while and  before i left  i told her that i wish there was a way i can see her more often  she suggested that we should do skype calls  i agreed              we started the year off by doing skype video calls once a week  the thing is    ive never done a skype call for anyone  i cant use phone to call people due to difficulties with my cochlear implant  too much background noise interference  so it took a lot of courage for me to do that first ever skype video call for someone i used to have a crush on  i was worried about my hearing not doing well with technical sounds  to my surprise  it turned out we communicated smoothly through the video call  shes changed a lot since high school  she was no longer shallow  but a caring person who like to check on my days and sometimes initiate on when we do our skype calls  she also texted me whenever i cant understand her on our video calls  we became partners against our similar struggles  she helped me as i applied for another job in my state  i helped her as she tried to get into a graduate school  last couple weeks  we both received bad news  she took it especially hard over her rejection from grad school on top of an ex abusing her emotionally  i made a decision to return to my parents house to re evaluate my life  we didnt text much for couple weeks  but then she requested to call me on skype tonight  we just went three hours having heart to heart conversation about our life  she knew i was returning to our small town so she was excited that well be near each other again  we talked about things well do this summer together  then i told her that i was taking her out for another round of drinks the first chance i get when i make my return  she eagerly said yes  we have such a good vibes toward each other so i could see amazing things happening for us down the road     were now     we met when we were    at beginning of this story  it took me   freaking years of self improvements to get where i am with this girl  it was completely unexpected because wed written each other off  the lesson here for you teenagers on here  keep working on yourself  push yourself out there to socialize even if its uncomfortable  make mistakes  learn from them  itll build your confidence and personality over the time  dont get obsessed with your crush and move on quickly if its a no  meet new people  go on dates with different people  even if they dont go anywhere  be fearless  never stop learning  prepare for the unexpected     tl dr   i met a girl when were     had a crush on her at     heart broken at     spent next   years improving myself  forgot about her and moved on with my life  we reconnected unexpectedly at    and had drinks  few months of skype calls later

does anybody else feel jealous of people who always have others defend them  i know jealousy isn t good  but i couldn t help but resent the fact that i always had to defend myself whenever someone antagonizes me or is otherwise being rude  there are people who never have to defend themselves against bullies or attackers  as they always have someone who s willing to stand up for them  i wonder how they do it   even toxic people can have these white knights  it s easier for me to describe them as this  no offense is intended   at my last job  i had an awful boss who was very unprofessional  played favorites with certain coworkers  and antagonized the subordinates who she wasn t all buddy buddy with  i reported her to her boss  and her boss stuck up for her  essentially replying with   so what   when i listed and documented all of the times my boss s behavior was toxic  ,0
i get uncomfortable when i m in a group of people who already know each other  so my roommate has people over often  they re in a  squad  and have so many inside jokes things to talk about that i wouldn t understand   it is always uncomfortable to be sitting with them and hearing them talk about these things that are a different language to me  ,0
in a weird way  im able to connect   x better with people who have problems and are vulnerable  than most other people  besides close friends   its like the fact that someone is a schizo or has issues puts them in the situation of completely not giving a fuck  and even if theyre weird  theyre unapologetically themselves  and are also non judgemental  whereas on the other hand  most people ive found are slightly insecure and quite judgemental so the process of getting them to open is longer  and you have to be more calculating  its hard to find someone whos genuinely open to other perspectives and not being fake and talking out of their ass to please you or avoid conflict  obviously  theres good reasons for this  social norms and rules and all that  but its still unfortunate   like i remember this one guy walking on the road blasting music and freestyling  he was definitely a bit out there mentally  and people were avoiding him hard and laughing at him  of course  he could have been  dangerous   but any empathetic person can see that its someone going through some shit  and its like theyre free styling  theyre not holding a fucking rifle or something  he was saying some pretty narcissistic shit though  ex   im this generations mozart   which was like  okay buddy   but despite that  the authenticity was a breath of fresh air  ,0
yall   i finally made an actual friend  a while ago i was sitting in my social sciences class  i was sitting alone at a table for two in the back of the classroom  it was the beginning of the lesson  so people were coming into the room and sitting down   a girl came in and looked around the room  came up to me and asked if she can sit next to me  in that lesson we talked and had fun and since then shes always been sitting next to me in social science class   after that we noticed that we had quite a lot of classes together   social science  german  biology  art and maths   since then weve always been sitting together in the classes we had together  we hang out in the breaks  we talk and laugh a lot   and just now we were chatting and she told me she was really happy we became friends and that i am important to her    i almost teared up  i havent had an   actual   friend in such a long time  i am so happy right now  edit  thanks for all the kind words  dear strangers  i really appreciate it  ,0
i know this will get lost  im very lonely   advice  ive been super sad ever since the start of school  every year i would be sad when it starts  and then i would get over it  this year is different  ive always had issues with school  ive tried all the options public  private  online  im in  th grade now and i feel like i cant relate to any of the kids  the only two types of kids are either super weird and quirky  or athletic  i hang with the athletic kids because those are the kids i know  i graduated from middle school at a private school  of the    boys    went to one school    went to another school  and    including me  went to my school  my best friend went to another school  and   of my closes friends are at other schools  the one friend i was close with went to the same school  this friend though is beginning to ditch me for other kids  to make it better hes moving states at the end of the year  this just wants to make me want to move cities and try to find somewhere else  should i stick out my shitty situation and hope it gets better  or should i ask my parents to look at possibly moving  it wouldnt hurt to look would it  ,0
nothing to say  try switching into curious mode youve probably heard the quote from dale carnegie by now       you can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you      and im not sure how much thought youve given it  but an interaction i had with a guy a few hours ago just reminded me of how important being curious is to making small talk   i was at a work event and i was making small talk with a colleague  nick  he mentioned that one of his passions is running  not being much of a runner myself  i didnt really know how to make a connection or what to say next  but i needed to contribute something because he was doing most of the talking and i wanted to keep the conversation balanced  its also important to keep the conversation focused on what someone enjoys talking about  so i wasnt about to switch topics     so what did i do  i switched into curious mode  i mentally went through everything i knew about running and asked about something i wasnt sure about  in this case  it was about those weird toe socks that a lot of runners wear  i had heard about them  but didnt know much about them   so i asked   do you wear those toe socks that i hear about    nick said   yeah  i own like five pairs  i love them    still in curious mode  i asked   what are they for  they dont look very comfortable    nick answered   oh  theyre designed so you dont rub your toes together and get blisters going long distances    i responded   oh i had no idea  that makes total sense  i guess i wont be needing those socks anytime soon    and he proceeded to tell me more about all the different equipment runners wear  etc  regardless of how interested i truly was  the conversation was smooth and engaging  thats always my    goal   make sure the conversation is enjoyable for them first  me second  sometimes you just need to pretend to be interested  and for those purists who think you shouldnt ever pretend   guess what  other people pretend to be interested in what you say too  its part of being polite  and part of being a good conversationalists  so get over it  anyway  point being   next time youre stuck without anything to say  switch gears into curious mode   hope this helps  and yeah  i like to blog about all my social skill tips and experiences  here  https   www socialupgrader com       x   b  ,0

why is it only when i truly lose all the interest in people around me and become an indifferent person do i get their attention and interest  i hate this  i m usually a fun person  i usually like to laugh a lot   i m caring   i m good at listening to people   i try to stay connected with people   but i never seem to have the mutual care and attention with any of my friends  but as soon as i become demotivated and lose all that positive  uplifting and caring energy  i suddenly get all the attention from them  they all start to text me and try to make jokes and try to get my attention  i don t get it  it feels like people are not attracted to my real self but the depressed version of myself  i m really confused    ,0
pauses during conversations doesn t mean it s not going well  i used to always try to fill pauses  it got so bad that i anticipate a pause coming so i immediately come up with something to say even if they re still talking  but now i learned that pauses does not mean that we ve ran out of things to talk about  it s just normal and there s nothing more to it  actually if you leave a pause  it will create a space for them to maybe bring up something that they want to talk about that they wouldn t have been able to if there are no pauses in between your conversation  ,0

 resource  master these and youre on your way to becoming a great conversationalist conversations skills are the crux of great conversations    because most of the time  it s not the words that come out of your mouth that determine whether someone will like you    it s how you make them feel    and when others feel good  theyll want to continue talking with you      so here are the primary conversational skills for you to implement to make others feel good while they re conversing with you        eye contact          your focus takes up your time and your time is your most precious asset  and which body part do you use for focus  think about it  whenever you re focused on something  your eyes are locked on to the object of your focus  so  by whenever you make eye contact  you re implying to the other person that they re important to you      active listening          it s not enough to have eye contact  you must shut up and listen  no  not just verbally  you must make your brain shut up with its internal thoughts about what you re going to say after that person stops talking  because when you genuinely listen  you ll create actual follow up questions or statements related to what they ve just said and that ll cue that you actually listened      correct body language         your body language is a huge cue to the other person of whether you re actually listening  so if you re objective is to build rapport  here are body languages that you ll want to utilize  draw your upper body closer to them when they speak rather than leaning back  keep an open body language  which means keep your hands by your side rather than crossed across your body  nod your head only after they make a point  not after every word  but most importantly  if your intention is to actually listen then you ll organically produce body language that cues to the other person that you re listening  you only need to focus on your body language if you re one who overthinks your body language which leads to inorganic body language      friendly intonation          intonation also cues how you feel about the other person talking to you and influences how they feel about you  if you sound aggressive when someone is talking to you  they ll feel less comfortable opening up  if you sound friendly  they ll want to continue  if you sound monotone  they ll perceive that you re bored and might feel less motivated to continue  so  it s important that you sound friendly with a flux of tone    additional conversational skills        talk slowly         when you talk slowly  you come off as secure  not just that  it sounds more pleasant so people will naturally want to listen  ever heard someone that talks like they haven t taken a breath after    seconds  damn annoying and makes you roll your eyes when they take a breath and start round    yeah  don t be that person      express emotions         want someone to appreciate you  express emotions because you ll be more relatable  nearly everyone is emotional and easily understands a word that conveys emotions and therefore can help someone put their feet in your shoes to really understand you  not everyone will try to understand facts because facts by itself are boring      ask tons of relevant questions         the best conversationalists aren t the ones who talk the most  they re the ones who ask the best questions to continue a conversation  additionally  by asking questions  you have the power to navigate the conversation so navigate it to a place of your interest to keep the other person engaged as well as yourself  ,0
how do i stop overthinking slightly embarrassing awkward moments  hello everyone     x   b   i am quite an introverted person  and my whole life i have been the type of person that when seeing someone they know  they slowly gaze in the other direction hoping to walk past them without any talking  however  in the last couple months i have really been pushing myself to try to be more friendly in those situations  my main problem is that after most of these short conversations  literally can be as short as  hey          hey man  see you at math class    i immediately start picking apart everything i just said  all the way up to my damn tone of voice  this always leads to me feeling like what i said was cringe  as you can probably tell  this becomes pretty severe in moments that are actually considered embarrassing  such as tripping and bumping into my teacher  which happened    minutes ago   when anything like that happens  it literally ruins my day as i brood over how awkward and stupid i must have looked  etc   has anyone dealt with this  i really want to stop overanalyzing these situations and continue on with my day without it being in the back of my mind for hours after   thanks for all of your help  ,0
any other introverts often get so sapped of social energy you just end up meditating through the social event  i feel like im super sensitive  and hyper aware of others emotional states  i naturally put all my focus and energy into my social interactions  and often find myself depleted of social energy halfway through an event  small talk is especially bad  it just kills me  i need deep  thoughtful conversations to keep me interested  anyways at that point i just end up sitting quietly by myself somewhere just meditating  feeling akward and hoping time would speed up so i can get outa there  i need some serious alone introvert time to recharge  and it has to be real alone time    if i in the presence of others  even if they are not paying attention to me  resting themselves  i cant seem to fully relax and get that recharge i need  it really helps if i focus on something  like journaling  art  music  keeping focused and busy on a task while im around others seems to protect me from this energy depletion   anyone else experience something similar  ,0
do not put anyone on a pedestal let me repeat that once more for you in case you didnt get it    do not put anyone on a pedestal    this goes with absolutely everyone  the truth is  no one wants or likes to be pedestalized   some people may experience a feeling of superiority  but deep down they will never want to be friends with the person that is pedestalizing them   when you put people on a pedestal  you sabotage no one but yourself  do you know why  let me ask you this first  whats one of the most important traits that make people charismatic and fun to be around   you guessed it     authenticity     a genuine connection  the real  goofy  whatever it is   unfiltered side of you  its what makes you who you are  you should never try to hide that or change it for anyone else   well  what if i offend some people or there are individuals who genuinely dont like that side of me  who gives a fuck  im giving this to you raw  the purpose is not to have everyone like you or become friends with everyone  the purpose is to filter out those who dont connect with you and find those who genuinely do  because let me tell you this   you will never ever be happy being someone who you are not  and you are not yourself as long as you pedestalize others   now heres how you can tell when youre not putting someone on a pedestal     you say whatever is on your mind at the moment without a second thought  no filter    youre not being serious all the time  you are you when youre light hearted and having fun  being serious usually means you are inhibiting your personality due to a fear of judgement rejection from the other person    you dont feel awkward in the interaction  awkwardness usually stems from putting someone on a pedestal    youre genuinely having a good time and are present in the moment  remember  everyone wants to have fun  people like good emotions  i dont care if its a girl boy you like  your neighbor  your co worker  your boss etc  you should always be light hearted and your authentic self  it is charismatic  people are attracted to authenticity in unimaginable ways   now there are some things you shouldnt do like swear at your boss  it is common sense and i needed to point this out because there are stupid people out there who will say does that mean i should swear at my boss just because i feel like it  obviously not  come on   everyone puts on a front these days  and the truth is   authenticity is magnetic but it is also lacking in todays society  in a world where communication skills are so vital  being extroverted and social truthfully helps you to thrive and succeed  we are social creatures and so we should learn to constantly be interacting with others and enjoying those interactions  and one of the first steps   is to   take people off the pedestal     edit  thank you everyone for your overwhelming support on this post  and thank you for the reddit silver    ,0
run out of things to say  try this quick exercise to improve your small talk and reduce your filter the reason why you find it so hard to talk to certain people is you let your filter block you   your filter is a natural survival mechanism that keeps you alive   imagine how well it would go if you walked over to the leader of your tribe  told him youre going to steal all his meat and take his women   youd likely earn a club to the face and your genetic lineage would stop right there   dont be hard on yourself if you struggle for things to say around people because youre normal   you just have to work on tuning down your filter a bit     a great exercise to help reduce your filter is talk to an inanimate object such as a wall   simply begin having a one sided conversation with it  since the wall wont contribute anything youll have to dig deep and carry the entire dialogue   it might feel uncomfortable and seem pointless but you owe it to yourself to give it a try      dont over think the subjects you choose       literally just pick the first thing that comes to mind and start talking   its extremely important to not judge yourself at all or you wont pick up momentum with it      dont try to search for high value or interesting conversation topics   literally anything will do       searching for high value things to say will often shove you further in your head and prevent you from actually getting anywhere   many people will not care how interesting your opening sentence was    you can start talking about anything random with someone such as the weather and then start baby stepping it to an actual conversation topic      start linking topics allowing you to jump from one to the next      you can easily go from talking how its pouring outside to talking about flooding in texas and moving onto how you know your cousin from there and how hes left to study in japan where you can get bananas from vending machines   this is the core skill of being able to master small talk     set a timer on your phone for a minute to start with   try to increase your timer by    seconds to a minute each time   if youre feeling adventurous set a stopwatch and shoot for as long as you can go    the following example is using the wall      hello wall  i see youre perfectly painted bright white and smooth   but looking closer i see that youre not quite smooth youre actually fairly rough  and bumpy   you know what else is bumpy  the fucking roads in my city  yesterday when i was going to work i nearly dropped my hot mocha overpriced hipster coffee diarrhea drink onto my man snake    that reminds actually of the time when i was mowing my lawn and i ended up slicing a snakes head off with the blade   the snake head flew out from under the mower right right at my feet   the other thing that has a snake was indiana jones and you know who was in indiana jones  harrison ford   it was such a shock to me when han solo died in star wars but it was even a bigger shock to hear when carrie fisher died   you know she did cocaine  i fucking love cocaine  just kidding drugs are bad   etc etc     the reason this exercise is so powerful for shy guys and people who filter themselves so much is that it forces you to draw deep within in order to carry the conversation   its      on you to keep going for whatever bench mark and its crazy to see the kind of progress you make with this   some guys can only go for    seconds whereas some guys cant even start    even if someone doesnt give you much to work with  youll always be able to draw from within in order to keep a conversation going   the other great benefit of this exercise is that it teaches you how to go through conversation threads   in the example i started talking about how bumpy the wall is and go to bumpy roads eventually ending up talking about star wars   normal conversations can be all over the place jumping from related topics to related topics and using this exercise can help you bounce around to more pleasant subjects or ones youre more knowledgeable about     if you can do this challenge to any extent youll be better suited to talk to people since theyll give you more than the wall   at the end of the day try not to judge yourself because just by the sheer attempt that you made to talk to someone is already a win   if you beat yourself up and dont give yourself credit youll crush your self esteem hard   realize that not everyone else is a social skill superstar either and that most people are tired and afraid    ,0
a comprehensive list of social tips and tricks here are a list of things that ive internalized and have been working on over the years  i would appreciate if you would leave your own tips in the comments  it would be nice to make a master list of social tips and tricks  ive probably missed some things  and im hoping you guys will fill in the blanks and teach me some new things  apologies if these are written strangely  im not the best at articulating my thoughts    maintain meaningful eye contact to establish presence  shifty eyes can indicate discomfort and a lack of confidence    stop speaking from the back of your throat and start speaking from your chest     avoid looking at the floor  always look straight forward or up     you can practice the way you talk by recording a conversation with yourself every day  this helps you articulate yourself better  which is a big aspect of confidence    smiles and laughter are contagious  same with enthusiasm    people love hearing their names  say them frequently  nicknames may also help to endear you to them  but i havent thoroughly tested this     chest out  shoulders back  good posture   confidence  take up space  hold yourself like a king     a conversation takes place entirely in the moment  stop thinking about what youre going to say  or what you have said  and work on being present  devote all of your attention to the conversation at hand to establish presence  when you find your mind wandering  take a deep breath and bring yourself back to the moment  on this same note  avoid fidgeting  sign of discomfort  or playing with something  like your phone  when in a conversation    whether people conciously realize it or not  anxiety is always noticeable  and infectious  take a deep breath and calm yourself    people like beautiful people  but theres only so much you can do to your face  be healthy and dress nice to maximize your looks   theres a whole lot i could go into on picking the right outfit for the occasion  but itd be too much for this post   this one is a half baked observation that i havent properly tested yet  beauty comes from symmetry  but if youre anything like me  youre not beautiful or symmetrical  slightly exaggerated facial expressions  dont go overboard  can help to hide this and probably make you seem more personable    ask people for favors  people like feeling useful    to establish friendliness  agreeableness    sit next to someone rather than across from them     body follows mind  mind follows body  its almost impossible to conciously maintain confident body language  but if you can get yourself in a confident mindset  fake it till you make it works wonders here  your body will follow  equally  if youre having a hard time getting yourself in a good mood  go somewhere private and throw your hands in the air  start dancing  jump around  etc  this one is lame  but its hard to be in a bad mood when youre like that  if you have good enough charisma you may actually be able to do this in front of others and you might find that your projected exitement becomes contagious  caution  know your crowd      adding on to the last point  to be charismatic  you need to be in a charismatic mood  a bad mood will ruin your social skills  so learn to control your emotions    make people feel unique and special  modern people like hearing about how theyre different from others  in good ways     a persons favorite topic is themselves   this is a big one     compliments are great  but make them meaningful  compliments on appearance tend to have less of an effect on women  but both men and women appreciate compliments on personality traits like kindness  attitude  intelligence  etc  strike a balance though  dont excessively compliment lest they take them for granted and they lose their value     make people associate your appearance presence with pleasent things  you want to reward people for talking to you and being around you  gifts and good smells work well  but good feelings work the best  this one is difficult to establish  im still trying to figure it out myself  i would very much appreciate if someone could add on to this   but try not to make people associate negative feelings with you  awkwardness and anxiety are big killers on this one      make people seek you out  if you initiate conversation too often  it can turn people off from you  conversation with you is a treat  people should come to you to earn it     mimic body language  in the event that your partner is exhibiting negative body language  continue to mimic them but slowly transform your own body language into that of confident body language  and oftentimes your partner will follow and inadvertently cheer themselves up  mind follows body    adopt certain phrases sayings metaphors etc based on the interests of the person youre talking to    first impressions are incredibly important    establish yourself as reliable  be the first to rise to a challenge  be the first to speak when the waiter asks for your order     a healthy amount of mystery is important to keep people interested in you     offer comfort  not advice  unless asked     recognize harmful thought processes and quell them quickly  i tend to sabotage my own conversations when theyre going  too  well  and i start doubting that i can keep it going  recognize these doubts  take a deep breath  and regain your presence     good social skills are boosted by a genuine love and interest in people     if you want a reliable way to practice social skills  eat at a restauraunt alone and make conversation with your server  they have an incentive to talk to you  tips  so youll always find a decent conversation partner    a lot of your social skill has to do with your internal state  its difficult to do anything socially when youre also trying to overcome anxiety  apathy  and low self esteem  most confident people never have to think about things this hard  think of the queen bee in high school  or the stars of the football team  everybody loves them  but i dont remember seeing any of them pick up  how to win friends and influence people   the strength of us less charismatic people is that weve been forced to assess our own inadequacy  and through diligent research and study  weve learned the ins and outs of conversation  we have comprehensive and thorough knowledge of what makes people charismatic   if you can conquer your internal roadblocks  talking to people will be a walk in the park  ,0
i went through the drive thru for the first time today  i have actually had my license for a year and i have avoided drive thrus because the thought of it gives me a lot of anxiety  i used to work at a fast food store so i know a lot of times there are cameras there and my co workers would always be upset when people didnt choose their food in a short amount of time  but today i went to one with my sister because i ran out of normal pants  so i had to put on my pajama pants  i was also just really hungry  it was really lovely  the cashier was really nice and recognized me from school and we made small talk  i think i am going to keep doing that lol  ,0

do    push ups  dont plan them  dont time them  just do them  a great technique ive been using for a while now when im alone is whenever i feel stressed or anxious or tired or anything  i just get up and do    push ups  its not a whole lot  so you wont get tired  but getting the adrenaline going through you totally kills any anxiety or stresses or fears ive had  this is especially helpful if youre texting someone and you get nervous or whatever  because getting the blood flowing really boosts my self confidence  i hope this works for other people too  ,0

getting more wins  boys  im still not at a point where im an extrovert or anything  i dont even want to be that  but i am at a point where i am no longer overthinking stuff and just doing  instead of debating on asking a classmate how the test went  i just did it  and it went fine   i even made some random chick laugh  i was walking up the stairs and she was behind me  i was holding an oversized water bottle and so i made a misstep and almost fell on my face  i heard her chuckle so i playfully said  you didnt see that  and she laughed even harder   i remembered that im actually a great talker  and a reasonably funny guy  so theres no reason for me to hide who i am  even if it goes wrong once or twice   which it does for everyone   theres no reason  to dwell on it either  the other person will most likely forget it sooner than you think   i think what made me improve the most is watching other people be like this  especially my friends  it gave me the confidence to believe that i can be like that too  maybe even better  trust me  my confidence isnt insanely high or anything  but its definitely gone up recently   edit  this post got way more attention than i expected  but karma doesnt make me nearly as happy as all the encouragement i got in the comments  so thank you so much for that  ,0

why do people assume quiet shy people are automatically stuck up  i ve always been the quiet kid  i recently started a job as a server in order to help develop my social skills and interactions in general  while i m fairly well at talking with costumers  the other servers consider me stuck up for not engaging in conversation and replying in one word sentences  i ve struggled with social anxiety for the longest time  and can never hold a conversation with anyone for long periods  including closest friends   i ve always hated this assumption  from mostly those who are naturally outgoing  that quiet shy people are stuck up and only care for themselves  where does this come from  ,0
i really hate when people flip the subject right as i bring one up  conversations like this   me   hey  so ive started doing             friend   oh yeah  ive been doing this    then we proceed to talk about their subject for the next    minutes   maybe i sound whiny  but i really hate this  like  i brought the topic up so we could talk about it  that wasnt your opportunity to change topics  its a pet peeve of mine because i feel like they dont give a shit about what i have to say  maybe they dont but it would be nice to have someone to listen to me on occasion  ,0
got shot down by girl i thought was into me  but i m glad i tried  for the past few weeks  this girl from my music class has been  seemingly  really flirtatious with me  first time i saw her i thought she was attractive  so i was happy to see she was interested in me  i was accidentally wearing the same shirt as her friend and he said he would take his off so we didn t wear the same thing  i said i can t take mine off  and she said  wooo  take it off   she would talk to me a lot and laugh at my lame jokes  bud in when i was minding my own business    i thought surely she was into me  all the signs felt right  and i wanted to initiate  well  our band had a performance party event tonight  i went to thrift stores to find nice clothes and my plan was to ask her if she wanted to dance during a slow tune    i had that opportunity and it felt like the stars aligned for me  it felt like destiny  so  we re talking and the conversation leads to talk of prom and slow dances  her choice of conversation  not mine   uncharacteristically of me  i ask if she would like to dance with me   it wasn t fate  because she turned my offer down  apparently she wasn t hesitant about slow dancing  because she did it with one of her girlfriends    though it didn t go as planned  i m glad i initiated and seized what i thought was an opportunity for romance  normally i am in a perpetual  she loves me  she loves me not  state  just thought i d share this  there s plenty of fish out in the sea  but this one didn t take the bait  oh well  now to wait for the next opportunity   edit  was not expecting this to blow up like it did   ,0
i have started smiling at strangers recently  here are my results  hello   some background first  so ive been told that my natural face looks stern and unfriendly  apparently i look quite intimidating even though i dont want to  i am a quieter introvert  but i dont think im shy  all of my friends are male like myself  i have never had a female friend   i decided to start an experiment to make eye contact and smile at as many strangers as i can for a week because of something that happened earlier in the week  i was looking down at my phone  and when i looked up  a very cute girl passing by looked at me and put on the most bright  loving smile ever  before looking away  this had never happened to me before  so naturally it felt really nice   my experiment is to put on a constant friendlier face  a small grin  because constant smiling is tiring   and also  whenever i pass a stranger  to give them a very large smile   i dont discriminate  i smile at men  women  all ages  i definitely am having an easier time with elderly people and a tougher time with girls my own age  i find that these girls tend to avoid eye contact once they spot you from afar  i suspect its because i am not too attractive  nevertheless  i shoot my shot and smile and a lot of times they do smile back   what have i learnt  smiling at others in a genuine way brightens their day  if you make eye contact and give the duchenne smile  i do it with my mouth closed   they instantly find you friendly and are likely to greet you with  hello  first   these past couple of days people seem less afraid to look at me  as i said apparently i look a little hostile naturally   i hold great conversations with service people  and they are appreciative  my success in speaking to girls my age  college  has also increased  because i smile as i talk to them           so i have made brief eye contact and smiled at      older men and women       young men  and      young women  the hardest part is making sure they lock eyes with you   older men and women  almost all smiled back and said hello or nodded in greeting   young men  nodded in greeting  with many smiling as well   young women  about half smiled genuinely  half broke eye contact  without smiling  when we locked eyes           smiling makes a difference  smile at everyone  try it for a week  just to see peoples reactions  ,0
how to be emotionally intelligent i volunteer at a clinic and sometimes we have people that get angry because they are having to wait and stuff  yesterday we had someone whose information we already had but we just couldn t get to her  she was acting beyond rude    the doctor that i was with was incredibly emotionally intelligent  he realized she was acting that way because she wasn t a rude person  she just wasn t getting what she expected to get  he walked in with a huge smile and called her ma am because it s difficult to get mad at somebody who s being friendly to you    instead of getting irritated he patted her on the arm and let her know that they were going to get her things done and thanked her for waiting  so physical touch   reassurance diffused the tension  he also walked fast and introduced himself as the doctor to establish competence and trust   then he  went over  the lady s folder in front of her   even though we had gone through it before  after the tension was diffused he started making jokes and asking her about herself  then commented on something they had in common  lastly  he squatted down beside her with her results and asked if she had any questions  and then truly listened to her  in the end she left satisfied    i asked him why we looked at her folder in front of her even though we had looked at it before  we could ve just told her that  he said that sometimes more important than the rational truth  or what actually happened   is how you show that truth and how you make people feel important  by seeing that people were looking at her folder she was reassured that we were taking the time for her    we can tell her until our tongues roll how much of an important patient she is to us but you have to do things that show people instead  because at the end of the day it doesn t matter how important she is to us  it s how important she feels she is to us    when we are dealing with more than   patient at a time  we make sure to tell the others with a quick pat on the shoulder and a specific  i ll be back in    minutes  i have to check on this other patient     i realized how important emotional intelligence is to any industry  and would recommend picking up a few books on it  notably  working with emotional intelligence     until i read that book i never realized how much emotionally intelligent people do  like my friend who says she was just thinking about me when i call her  regardless of whether it s true or not  it made me feel good and i am an oblivious walnut so i don t realize what people are doing to make me feel this way  is it manipulative  maybe  do i care  no  not really    making people feel good and important is a skill that will get you extremely far in life  i don t know why it s not taught in schools  ,0

i have made zero friends in college  graduating this semester    so im about to graduate  i dont go to a traditional university so its always been hard to make friends  i tried joining a couple of clubs but just didnt click with the people because of my crippling social anxiety awkwardness   ive made acquaintances but no real friends  i dont go out  i dont have a friend i can really have lunch with  i have a few friends from my semester abroad and from high school but they all live in different states  i really want to move to a new city for work and grad school but i cant help feeling disappointed with myself  i am afraid im gonna live my   s     rn   with no social life and not much to look forward to  i just need some advice on what to do to make new friendships at this point  like i said  i have a lot of social anxiety and am going to see a therapist about it     x   b   edit  the feedback and support on this post is incredible  thanks so much to everyone for taking the time to help me out    ,0
best way to make true friends in your   s    y o m here  i have depression  i have burned a lot of bridges in my life and have had difficulty with being vulnerable to anyone and everyone for fear that they will somehow leave me  im in therapy for this now     months ago  my girlfriend and i broke up  this was the catalyst that finally made say  enough is enough  i need to get my shit sorted out if im ever going to have healthy relationships where i feel secure  i saw a doctor  started taking anti depressants  and started regularly seeing a therapist  im reading a lot of self help books and fixing myself slowly  i have realized one of the biggest reasons why i am depressed is that i am both alone and lonely  i hardly have any friends and its getting harder and harder to make friends as i get older    when i look back at my life   and recall the times that i actually made some friendships   it was because i was part of something bigger than myself  for example  i went through a pre med program in college where i took the same classes with people   the classes were really hard but we helped each other   we got to know each other well and developed really good bonds  when i was in that program i had a lot of friends   i still have one good friend left from that program  one of the few friends that i currently have     another example is when i joined a intramural sports team and we all became close because we had to work together to win games   we bonded after the games by going to the bar and hung out on the weekends  ive burned a lot of those bridges by not staying in touch   i have also been living in a new city for the past year    so  i suppose my question is how do i recreate that  bigger than myself     common struggle  environment to develop close friends  what hobbies   activities have worked for you     i realize that some activities   hobbies are just not conducive to making friends  like photography  painting  or running  what can i take up in my   s that will recreate that environment that is so special to building true bonds   friendships  any ideas  thank you   tldr  what are some hobbies   activities   interests that create a  bigger than me     common struggle  environment which is conducive to developing true friends in your   s  what things have worked for you   ,0

it doesn t cost you anything to compliment somebody  dont be afraid to give a genuine compliment to anybody   many times in our lives we see people with good taste or do cool things and we just think to ourselves  what a cool                  and we say nothing even though we could brighten that persons day by sharing our thoughts   giving compliments is a great way to open strangers up  make friends  and do something positive for this world  and it costs you nothing   if you wish you got more compliments  be the change you want to see in the world and compliment at least one person every day     x   b   edit  delivery of compliment also matters   if you are constantly getting negative reception on your compliments think about what you usually compliment  clothing is always safe   the way you deliver it  and also the way you look  if you are put together with good fashion sense people will take it better   ,0
i m great with strangers   first impressions are my speciality  however  once that person becomes an acquaintance  i start getting more   more uncomfortable as we are  getting closer  does this happen to anyone else  it s like the more i get to know someone  the more anxious i feel when i m around them   ,0

how do i approach a shy girl with no friends in my class  there s a shy girl in my class who i like  she s always alone and i don t think she has any friends in school since i ve never seen her talk to anyone  unless when the teacher asks her something  making her stutter somewhat  i m not so introverted anymore but i m still nervous around girls   we haven t really talked before  however we aren t complete strangers  she knows my name and i know hers    we both also make eye contact with each other multiple times a day  either one of us looks away quickly   she never smiles while doing this  however i ve seen her smile slightly while looking down a couple of times after eye contact   however i m not exactly sure if those things mean anything  but still   how do i approach her  what am i supposed to even say to her  what if she completely ignores my attempt to talk to her  thank you  edit  i ve read all the comments and i m grafeful to everyone that helped  thank you ,0
stop saying youre  socially awkward   when trying to change yourself  your mindset frame of mind is very very very important  i see this phrase a lot in this sub  i am socially awkward    socially awkward guy girl here  etc  the problem  in my opinion  with this mentality is it forms itself as an identity  when people say they are socially awkward  it seems like they have been defeated by this identifier as if being socially awkward is just  who they are   going into interactions youll be subconsciously identifying yourself as  socially awkward  in your head  putting that label on yourself  causes you to start acting that label  you start to become this idea of  socially awkward    no   you are not socially awkward  you are learning  which is better than what a lot of other people can say they do with their time  you are not going to be like this forever and you are not awkward  when someone is learning to play football or basketball or do gymnastics  do we call them  physically awkward   no  because theyre learning   mindset is important  dont place yourself under this  socially awkward  identity  because it will hold you back  you are better and have more potential than you think  ,0
just got ditched by my whole friend group so  they completely teared me apart    against    they said i wasnt myself  i was just copying them  they sai that if i was myself maybe i would fit in the group  maybe  now i have zero friends in my classes  any advice would be awesome   didnt know what other sub i could use  this one seemed the best one to me   please dont let this die in new  ,0
do you guys experience sudden changes of confidence  how do you deal with it  what are the triggers  why does this happen  it tends to happen to me a lot  today throughout the whole day at school  early   s  college   i was kicking it socially  making people laugh  talking about whatever came to mind  enjoying myself so much that even when i made a bad joke or awkward comment people would still engage  made two new potential friendships  approached a new girl who joined our class to finish her master thesis and approached a much older guy who already has his own business and joined our class to get into law  had wonderful interactions with both and they are now introduced to our class  at least my group of     people  instead of being outsiders thanks to me  even when i playfully teased people it went amazing  for example a teacher of ours was telling us about how her dog always cleans his paws when going inside and i pointed to a girl  whos a classmate i have a pretty good relationship with  and went  i keep telling her to do the same thing and she just wont   she playfully started hitting me  and called it back in our next class by hitting me again  and i went  shh  bad girl   and she was loving the whole thing  ofc i was always smiling and laughing  i wasnt being mean spirited at all   then at night i went to play pool with some classmates    and it just sucked  i wasnt feeling happy at all  and that confident  i want to be playful and mess with people and have fun mood was totally gone  i was much more quiet and self conscious  if i made a bad joke or awkward comment  id immediately go inward and beat myself over it  and i didnt really make that many today  but i relied on self deprecating humor a lot  which i tend to do when im anxious about having to respond  well  and not upset the other person  this particular group is always shittalking each other  and when im feeling playful i talk back  when im anxious i just playfully submit  other times when im feeling self conscious id do the opposite and just go overboard and actually be mean  so instead of playfully teasing people i get extremely sarcastic and people can sense that and tend to react negatively  fortunately today i didnt turn sarcastic  just self deprecating   why  what triggers this  can anyone relate going from talkative  top of the world feeling where youre enjoying yourself no matter what happens to a very fragile state of self consciousness in a matter of hours   could you ever figure out a trigger  i have a few hypothesis  one being going to a party pool game bar whatever with the subconscious feeling of  i should have stayed at home because im way behind on my studies   another one being hanging out with couples while i currently have no partner  i think i am more confident when im around people im attracted to trying to attract  instead of feeling like a constant third wheel   another one  related  is being with people who dont really excite me that much  finally  doing things i dont particularly enjoy  for example  i am very competitive  but at the same time im not good at pool nor have that much fun playing it  so maybe this helps bring my mood down a notch  i dont know  you guys experience this  what are your thoughts  ,0
my self confidence just plummeted ive been working so hard the last few months to become more positive and self accepting and was making great progress   but i feel like all that work has just been undone in less than a day   i have a friend group who are generally good people  we tend to tease each other for fun and i dont mind it because it toughens us up a bit    however my looks have always been a laughing matter among them  specifically my height and short hairline  features which in my eyes are perfectly fine but im not sure i can trust my judgement anymore   more specifically ive been told multiple times i can look like a child predator because of this  other insults include school shooter and old man  but these dont bother me as much  i can usually just about get over it because im sure what they say is an exaggeration but the more i hear it the more convinced i am that im cursed with bad looks   yesterday though someone mentioned it about a picture they took of me  me hoping it would be a decent picture  and it just cut so much deeper than before  afterwads the group of us took pictures together and i just felt like i may aswell not burden their photos with my looks at that point   when we got back i locked myself in my room and balled my eyes out like never before  i dont know what to do at this point   i should add  my friends  who i live with  arent heartless  im sure if i told them not to do it they would stop  but it doesnt change the facts  though it may be time to detach myself from them  as i think the need to one up each others insults constantly isnt healthy anymore   sorry for the essay  i appreciate you reading this    edit  thankyou so much everyone for your help  you dont know how much it means  i feel much better about things   i think my best option is to talk to my friends and try and figure things out  i was a bit hasty thinking of distancing myself so quickly  if things dont change though it wont be so bad as im finishing university in two months anyway    hopefully things turn out better in the end   ,0

i did it  so after lurking for a while in here and learning some skills  i was talking to the girl i like and an opportunity was handed to me    i was talking to her late at night  normally the time we both can talk  we were talking and i mentioned that i went and saw bohemian rhapsody    she dances and said she wanted to see the nutcracker   woah an opportunity   so i asked her if there was a night this week that she was free so we could see it  we both agreed on saturday  i asked her what she liked for snacks so im going to swing and get those before i pick her up   ,0
i coach people with social skill deficiencies and anxiety for a lot of money  the most common source i see is assuming that everyone doesnt will not like you  if you can overcome that mental barrier  and act accordingly  you will solve     of your problems  update  since this post took off and i am still receiving questions and requests   days later  ive decided to write a book  if you want to know when it is released leave your email in the link below   i left a spot for content requests  if you leave a request suggestion ill send you a coupon before release  if i use it ill send a free copy and credit you in the book  https   goo gl forms tiawxyswkileklpq  i wont share your email or contact you unless its about the book     of course convincing yourself of that is the trick though    edit   a lot of people are msging me for appointments  i only work in nyc as i have a real job and only do this on the side  im generally by client referral only so unless youre really pulling on my heart strings  or have a book deal  its staying online only    take a look at my comment with my  principals   i used to be incredibly shy and introverted with almost no friends  i taught myself how to overcome this and now im extremely extroverted and can get along with pretty much anyone right away  it has helped my personal and professional life immensely so i decided to help other people in my spare time   what i learned during my personal development is what i teach  its not impossible  you just need to work on it   ,0
am i being harsh in having no interest in allowing people who mistreated me in the past back in my life  i ve been reflecting about things a lot lately  and i ve come to a realisation that if someone used to bully mistreat me in the past  then i don t want them back in my life  even if they seem like they ve changed  there are so many people in the world who will treat me well consistently  so why should i waste my time on people who used to mistreat me  and could possibly do it again     beforehand  i would always accept them  while feeling resentful on the inside  when they would inevitably turn out to be just as shitty as they were before    people are like  oh you should give people a chance if they ve changed  but i d rather just start afresh  sometimes i feel harsh and guilty  especially as i had a friend who i had known since we were babies  but i ended the friendship because she used to put me down constantly and resentment started building up    edit  by  mistreatment   i mean  intentional  belittling put downs   even more so if it happens in front of other people   harsh judgements criticisms of my personal preferences  values and personality traits  eg  the fact i m quiet  and pressuring me to change them  constant gossiping to the point that i can t trust them or be vulnerable  being controlling  generally just not showing consideration or concern for how i feel  dismissive when i try to confront them over their shitty behaviour  edit  i m certainly not a hypocrite  if i mistreated someone  i would fully expect to be cut out of their life  ,0
does anyone else feel like they dont have anything interesting going on in their lives   im   m  for starters  as the title suggests  i really feel alone and like im living a boring uninteresting life right now  my days consist of going to school  college   doing homework  and just spending the rest of the day by myself browsing through whatever on my phone or playing some videogames  in school and at home im always secretly hoping that someone will approach me  talk to me about something  i want to be in some social situations  i want to be able to chat with people and act silly with them  like i see so many people doing  like for example  some group of girls sitting at a nearby table gossiping and laughing with each other about something    i do have a few friends  but i feel like theyre always busy doing something  namely working  because they mention it alot   so i have no one to talk to about anything  no one to do anything with  no one to be with  you know  i really want something  good  of course  to happen to change the monotony of my life  to meet someone to talk to  and maybe even be in a romantic relationship with  which is also something big that i struggle with   i want to connect with someone and start a worthwhile relationship  to interact with people more   edit  thank you all so much for the support and sympathies  i had a feeling that what ive been going through isnt particularly unique and uncommon  but i didnt think this many people shared the struggle  ill definitely consider your suggestions and try to  join some clubs  the gym and maybe also a small part time job  again  thanks for the help everyone  ,0
  story  do not become a people pleaser even if people end up thinking youre a jerk so i work retail and it can become a   person job in some cases  normally im fine with helping others and doing anything i can to make sure our job gets done  however  sometimes im busy with a project and i cant even help if i wanted to    months ago i was that guy who would do anything for someone at work even when they could easily do it themselves but just didnt want to  then  it got so bad that my coworker said    you cant keep putting other peoples work before yours because now your stuff isnt done  it wasnt uncommon for me to have half finished projects    today  i finally felt the affects of not being a people pleaser  my coworker needed me to do something but i was busy  i told them i couldnt and she said   see  this is why i like kevin better because youre just rude  instantly i felt horrible and bad but soon realized that i cant just do something to please someone  itll only make me miserable    obviously when you can help someone you should  but if its detrimental to your job i dont suggest it  even if they call you a jerk for it   ,0

held back from calling someone out on their bullshit for not putting effort into a friendship  i feel proud of myself i wrote a really long message in my notepad app about what i wanted to say  but made the choice not to send it     it s been an on and off struggle trying to maintain some sort of relationship with this person i thought i was cool with  but i was more attracted to the idea than understand who they really are   we have a bit in common  but for some reason i guess the compatibility didn t work out for them   it s not my business to question why and to try to persuade them otherwise  as much as i ve wanted to   whatever issues or insecurities they re dealing with  it s on them and i can only try to be there for them so much   got sick of the one sidedness of me being the one checking in all the time  sending cheerful memes  starting conversations   i ve been in denial and made excuses for why they may not reciprocate   perhaps they re shy  or introverted  or need to warm up to me more   you ask if everything is ok   they tell you they re going through a lot and not to worry   but then you see them being active on social media  acknowledging other friends and people  making snapchat stories related to things that perhaps you d appreciate but get upset that you didn t get a direct snap about it   if i m likely the last thing they re thinking about  then it s going to have to be mutual   maybe that s selfish of me to say  but i m tired of the effort  i shouldn t have to be someone s option   i shouldn t have set my expectations high  which i ll admit is my fault   i need to move my energy to people who would like to keep a rapport going with me and don t want it to have to feel like a chore for them and just reply for the sake of being polite   anyway  having gone to sleep after i typed up the message  i woke up and realized it wasn t worth it   what would it have accomplished   likely nothing   and it would have just made me look too desperate   so i deleted it   it s been a few days since i last made contact   i will do what i can to keep myself busy  put myself out there and either talk to new people or continue to build the mutual bonds i currently have with people   i don t know where i m going with this  and there will be times when i ll feel miserable thinking about them  but i know it will be for the better   if anyone here can relate  that would be awesome   otherwise thank you for reading    edit  i am pleasantly surprised by the number of responses i got out of this   it s been cheering me up  for a while i ve felt worthless and a burden to this person because of the lack of effort they ve been putting in  but i can t let this get to me  ,0
girl winked at me and i m not used to this so i m a freshman in college    m  and i was in something that wasn t a class  it was a one time workshop that was required  so we don t meet as a group again  recently i ve lost some weight and given more attention to my looks  as i ve always been overweight and dressed like a slob and wondered why girls wouldn t even blink an eye at me  so attention from girls is wayyy out of the norm from me  so i was one of the last people to enter the room and grab a seat  and i chose a table towards the back that no one else was at  cause i m shy   so this workshop is going on and everyone s doing their thing  and then i look towards the front of the room and this girl sitting at one of the table has her head on her hand  looking directly at me with a smirk  and winks  i thought this only happened in movies  i was immediately thrown off and just smiled at her and in the confusion and heat of the moment i attempted a wink which resulted in me just blinking really hard  fuck me  she was very cute if i m being honest  but my dumbass was too afraid to look her in the eyes the rest of the class  i couldn t figure out what to do if she started throwing looks at me  so the class ends and i was going to try and get her name and number or something  but i pussied out and grabbed my shit and walked out of the door  once i got out thought  i said  you know what  fuck it  i m waiting here for her to come out   so i did for about    min  and she never came out    fuck me  and i had to get going because i had work  i can t even think of a way to find her or get her name or anything  hopefully we ll see each other on campus  and at that point i m not backing down  had to tell someone lol  so there you go   edit  wow  this post got a lot more attention than i was expecting  thank you for all the encouragement and kind words  i ll let you guys know if anything new happens           ,0

how the hell are you supposed to talk to strangers make new friends  people say  especially with the internet nowadays  that they dont like when random strangers try to talk to them in public while theyre going about their day      x   b   but isnt talking to strangers how you meet new people in the first place  wasnt everyone you know with the exception of your parents a stranger at one point  how the hell are you supposed to talk to people if talking to strangers is considered  rude       x   b   is time and place important  like being at school or at work  where everyone more or less knows each other to an extent  or a place specifically made to be social  like some sort of bar  a club  or a party  or how about a park  if youre just bored and another person is also by themselves  looking bored     x   b   but i can imagine that being approached someplace like a gym  a library  the street  a bus  or a train station would be rather annoying as the person is usually in the middle of something has a certain goal in mind and doesnt wanna be distracted  ,0
i wish you could be good at socializing by just being a good person  but its mostly about confidence and charisma it would be much easier to socialize if it was just about being nice  a socially awkward person with no confidence could be the most kind hearted person in the world and be written off as a creep if they cant socialize in a deft manner  people who are good at socializing tend to have charisma  but that just means theyre likable  it doesnt say much in regards to their overall character  i feel like a lot of people dont talk about that here and treat these  social butterflies  as people who have got their lives put together or something  and put them on pedestals  having good social skills is just a skill  like playing a sport or musical instrument  people whore great at socializing arent somehow enlightened in a way that others arent  they have just developed a personality that isnt so domineered by insecurities and have a knack for navigating in social situations   i wish you could be good at socializing by just being a good person  but its mostly about confidence and charisma  if you are domineered by insecurities and dont have a knack for navigating social situations  socializing is tough  regardless of what kind of person you are   i know i may be misinterpreting peoples views of  social butterflies   but i feel like there are some who make it sound like these people are somehow better human beings than individuals with social phobias  it may sound like i have an inferiority complex  but im just mentioning this  because i want more people to find help here  i spend my time on less productive subreddits and a lot of those people wont accept advice or guidance  because they feel like they are being talked down to by  normies   ,0

i have no real friends in college  i m approaching my junior year in college and i m realizing i have no real friends  the ones i m closest with don t really care about me  don t give me support  and really just take advantage of me at the end of the day  one thing that hurts as well is that i was in a relationship with a guy and he hurt me badly and yet they still hang out with him and go to parties with him  i know i shouldn t expect them to cut someone off because of me but it still hurts  i m an introvert and all my friends are extroverts so when they go out to parties i feel left out but also i know parties cause me a lot of anxiety so i m better off staying home  i feel alone and isolated all the time  going through rough times by myself because they don t care much  i ve been realizing that i care too much for people and i don t get that same energy or care back and i always end up suffering  it took me so long to find friends that i m unsure how to find new ones   update  those are my ex friends now and we blocked each other ,0
i want my mind to be sharp  i want to be able to always have something to say  im a    year old man and have just graduated college    feeling lost in life   i have this blank buzzing in my mind in conversations a lot  some of it is anxiety  but i think a lot of it is a lack of mental sharpness    i feel like ive been drinking a lot lately  perhaps thats affecting my ability to convey thoughts    i just feel like a blob    i want to be alive and have great conversations again   and not be anxious when talking and worry about my voice quivering     x   b   i havent always been like this  quite the opposite actually   things have just gotten much worse since i sank into another depression about half a year ago   help ,0
don t be afraid to be rejected it s better to get it over with rather than letting the possibility loom  ask yourself what the worst possible scenario is really like  and how likely it is to happen  chances are that your mind is just exaggerating  ,0
i love not socializing because of the pandemic  is this concerning  for context  i am currently a senior in high school  so thanks to the pandemic  my prom and grad is cancelled  some part of me is sad  but  i dont know why  i am mostly happy because i dont need to meet people  teachers and friends  everyday   because of the online learning  i am now working my part time customer service job most of the time  so i am not completely in isolation   but recently  things started to reopen  so my school is planning this thing for seniors  and my friends are all going  yet  i dont feel like going  also  my friends are starting to make plans whatsoever   i dont have any mental health illness like social anxiety  but i dont have the will to interact with my friends in person  i was fine before the pandemic and i loved to go out with them prior the pandemic  so i dont know why i dont feel like meeting them in person  also i talk to them daily through messaging  so its not like im completely off contact with them    i just prefer to just stay at home with my family watching movies and stuff on my day off  instead of socializing with friends in person   is this concerning   tl dr   i dont like to socialize with friends in person anymore because of the pandemic  ,0
how do i have conversations with friends after getting to know them  i usually start at ease when asking new people things we may like and connect over it but after that initial conversation i tend to just run out of things to say and i hope they ll start a new conversation  with my new friend i feel like it s just too quiet inbetween questions  how do i fix this  what can i do to help me talk more  ,0
befriend an extrovert  hey all  just wanted to share a tip that helped me overcome social anxiety  i made friends with a very social person and somehow they changed me completely  the guy who used to stay away from people now loves talking to and meeting new people  i don t know if this is helpful at all especially since in order to do this you have to make a friend and talk to them  but i hope it can be of done use  ,0
how do i signal to someone  using body language  through general day to day interactions that i wish to be their friend for some reason  like an acquaintance  you re out there trying to meet people  how should your body language be so that people can feel relaxed approaching you  how do i become a people person  ,0
its good to expect those close to you to be supportive in tough times  but not to be your therapists  if you talk a lot about your problems and find people are emotionally withdrawing or becoming frustrated with you  you might be just be wearing them out  seek professional help  if people every tell you that you are  too intense   or something along those lines  it often is a disguised way of saying you are expecting too much of them emotionally  ,0
i always delete the comments i m about to make or completely rearrange what i m about to say to someone text wise  i don t like sharing my thoughts  mostly because i think it won t matter and it always brings some type of negativity   not because my thoughts are bad  just because people have opinions and someone always thinks something is wrong  ,0
to those who were always praised by adults for being  quiet  in school   do you think that has contributed to the reason why you lack social skills now    f  all throughout grade school  teachers would point me out in class and use me as an example of how a  good student  should behave   simply because i didnt talk much and was very obedient  i guess it didnt occur to them that i wasnt like that because i so desperately longed to fulfill their idea of a perfect student  but because i had anxiety   nevertheless  their approval made me feel like i was doing something right  it wasnt until i entered middle school that i realized all of those loud  hyper  and talkative kids from previous years were now far more developed than i was when it came to being sociable    i was awkward  didnt know how to hold a conversation or joke around  and couldnt fit in for the life of me  and i cant help but wonder that if i was never applauded for essentially sitting down and shutting up for so long  would i have turned out any different   i wasnt as social or outgoing as the other kids were in elementary  but adults viewed that as a great quality rather than something that was unusual and could potentially become a problem  not that im blaming them or anything  its just a thought  ,0
is it normal that i always have to be the one initiating conversation with new people  im in college and if i sit next to someone new i try having a conversation with them  is it normal that no one ever tries to talk to me  i feel like its probably because most people are in their own worlds and dont like talking to strangers   edit  thanks for all the kind words   ,0

i went out to an event and made friends  hello all  long time lurker and first time poster here  you guys have helped me learn so much about being a good listener and being a little less awkward  combined with the medication i ve been taking for social anxiety  zoloft  and therapy  i was able to muster the courage to drive out to an art group meeting   i got along easily with the other people in the group and by the end of the meeting they asked me to join them for dinner  unfortunately i had to attend to a family matter but they encouraged me to come to the next meeting  it was a great feeling putting myself out there and to feel welcomed  and i m definitely going to the next meeting  ,0
if a weird person asks you what they can fix about themselves  please dont repeat platitudes  i cant fucking do it  i hate this so much  i dont give a shit how much i shouldnt care about what others think  im so sick of asking people who have literally called me weird what exactly made what i did weird and getting a stock  bullshit answer as they laugh behind my back  im sick of not being able to ask what i do thats socially awkward without being socially awkward  then getting a platitude about how i shouldnt care  as they talk about how weird i am   i cant even ask my friends who have confirmed im weird to help me out  i cant ask people i know  they all pull shit on me and tell me i dont know why ur weird dude  being weird is ok  whats weird to me isnt weird to others so i dont say anything it doesnt help and i appreciate it but as someone trying to improve over the last four fucking years and  as much progress as ive made  im still slow because no one gives constructive criticism like in other places where you improve  all these platitudes do is send me spiraling more into depression in self hatred because i know no matter how hard i try i cant change for my own good  i cant change  no one will allow me to  and everyone makes it seem like im changing for others but im not  im trying because im so tired of feeling like shit when someone knocks down all of the progress that ive made  i want to interact comfortably and not overthink things  i went to hang out with friends for hours yesterday and the entire thing made me hate my life even more  it included every instance of my life that i hate  ive been called ugly  weird  been told no wonder youre single  i just feel off no matter what   i dont want to be given the milisecond stink eye because i did something weird without knowing and then not be able to understand why  the fact that im unable to ask what it was that i did without either being lied to by the exact person or told theres nothing wrong as they make many jokes about me being autistic makes me sick to my stomach  it makes me hate people  im starting to give up  thinking about it is about to result in a mental breakdown because i feel so helpless  ,0
randomly approached a girl i thought was attractive at a cafe for the first time  definitely a learning experience  it was initially very nerve wracking  and i was basically reading a bunch of  r getmotivated posts on my laptop before i found the courage to do it  she was a young professional sitting by herself with her laptop working on a programming project  i decided to walk up to her after i got my coffee and asked what kind of project she was working on and she just kinda smiled and explained it was her own project to help get a job she was applying for  we made some very quick small talk and then she quickly but kindly and respectfully told me that she really needed to get back to work  so we both said bye to each other before i sat back at my table at the other end of the cafe  she didnt snear at me like i was some random creep  or rolled her eyes about a guy possibly hitting on her at a cafe while she was doing her work  which was in retrospect  the irrational fear in my mind  i immediately got the signal that she wasnt interested in talking further and in a funny way  im kinda proud of myself for both being able to read that signal  honing my communication skills  and actually approaching a stranger in a public setting like this which i would have been petrified of doing a couple years ago  hopefully this increase in confidence in talking to new people will help me in the future    what i take away from this little experience is that with more and more practice  you start realizing it never hurts to try  and that its only gonna be good for you in the long run      edit  wow  didnt expect a simple post about my experience yesterday would get      upvotes  thank you for all the kind words and responses     i hope there are at least some people who have read this who are now inspired to step out more of their comfort zone in the future      ,0
i had the time of my life and i just wanted to thank you guys so i posted here a while back about getting casted in a play at my school and how i got the confidence after reading this sub for a while  i got casted and i made some really great friends  the play was some of the most fun i ve had in my life  i finally feel a part of something now  i ve had a pretty rough year and to have found drama at this point has been such a blast and i haven t been this happy in years  so i cannot stress how much i owe this sub  thank you all for being such a supportive community because i don t know where i d be without y all   here s some photos from the play  https   imgur com gallery ij  jf   ,0
im retiring from this sub and here is why    i subscribed to this subreddit probably seven years ago  i needed help like anybody else on this sub  i lurked and checked out everyones theories   fake it til you make it    be the best you that you can imagine   stand up straight  speak with more confident tones  be direct  ford etc  and that stuff did some help but ultimately fell short when it came to actually existing in a social setting and establishing true and honest connections with people around me  now  i have an amazing gf  im back in college and excelling academically  im a leader in the clubs im involved in  and i have several different friends groups filled with people that enjoy being around me    the number one thing i did to help me become a more social person was to work in the food and service industry that forced interacting with people  strangers regularly  it also taught me that social interactions are a two  way street and that success socially does not          depend on you  if somebody is having a shit day and they dont want to talk to anybody and some asshole comes up and starts  ford   ing them its not your fault  just practice and establish a baseline social confidence level and youll learn to recognize when people are just being short  bitchy  or just plain anti  social   so my advice upone unsubbing here is to       force yourself to interact a lot somehow  i did it through serving tables  the only way we get better is by practice  no single trick will get you there  it took years for me to feel really confident with myself and what i can offer socially  dont be too worried       develop hobbies and interests that come with social interaction  i did that through magic the gathering and music production editing  found two really great groups of people i can hangout with       if things feel awkward with somebody realize that it might not be your fault  people who are friendly and want to talk are easy to talk to       if you find yourself running out of things to talk about  you need to diversify your life  start simple  try every exciting sounding restaurant or bar in your area  try all your favorite types of beer from each brewery  try to find the best wings in the state etc  create experiences and stories you can share and relate to people with and the rest comes easy    thanks everyone for helping me find confidence  hope everything goes well for you    edit  whoa that s a lot of upvotes  a couple of things since it s been up a day       the internet and reading are great but are not a replacement for going out and practicing the real thing  it s good to stay up to date on news  recent events  or as part of your hobbies  but if you re reading about social  techniques  or some  try these    things  lists you might actually be hurting yourself  as an introvert growing up i wanted to believe they re was some trick  some secret that i didn t get and that i could find it with research  i m telling you there s really not  close reddit  get out there       don t feel pressure to be overly clever or interesting  being interesting has more to do with doing things people will find interesting than any kind of clever word smithing  to use my previous examples  hitting up the newest brewery can lead to some interesting conversations with beer lovers or people who are curious about beer  it still won t be interesting to somebody who doesn t drink alcohol  generally speaking a light heart  a curiosity about the world  and a willingness to explore will get you further  listen well  your responses will become sharper and witty the more you listen and understand what someone is saying and where they re coming from       i m leaving because this place can honestly make me a bit sad  there s exploitation going on with people trying to funnel you into some  pay to live  social trick scam  i m leaving because the only real trick is to be out there in the world not reading about it on here  i wanna grab all y all and shake you and hug you and tell you to close reddit and go live  there are very few legitimate experts who post scientific documentation here   beyond the support group effect and the sporadically useful acronym there s not much here for me  it s not worth being sad for me to come here  ,0
i overcame my social anxiety today and i m really proud of myself    i have this app where you get job applications and you can just press a button to hand in your cv  a couple of days ago i handed in my cv with that app for a job in a restaurant in my hometown  i still hadn t heard anything about my application  so my dad started saying i had to go to the restaurant to let them know i was really interested in the job and so that they could see my face in real life    of course my social anxiety took over  i started postponing going to the restaurant  but my dad started getting mad at me and told me it was important  so i grabbed my bike  drove out of sight and started crying  i stood there for about    minutes before i left to go to the city  i parked my bike next to the restaurant and freaked out  to calm myself i just started walking away from the restaurant  i walked around in my city thinking about what i will say when i finally have the courage to go in  then i arrived back at the restaurant  this time i went in    i was so nervous  but when i got to this lady she was so kind and comforting  it went great  i said everything i had rehearsed and i was so relieved when i got out of the restaurant  because in my opinion i did a great job  she said she was going to contact me  so i hope that s a good thing  ,0
i want to be the person i am in my head whenever theres somebody i care about  potential romantic interest i guess  or friend who i havent been in contact with   in my head i can have a natural conversion  or initiate a friendly touch  in real life  however  i can barely open my mouth to start a normal conversation  i just sort of sit there quietly doing whatever im doing scared to breathe too loudly  once theres conversation  i can join in fairly comfortably  but i dont feel like i can really be myself if im scared to say do something all the time   id like to be able to just say whats on my mind when im thinking to myself during some sort of downtime  but in the moment  im just kinda freaking out in my head  like  i hope i dont seem weird  and stuff  these thoughts are stopping me from being myself  sure maybe theyre preventing myself from social issues  but i dont feel good about myself without being able to say what im thinking   any suggestions    sidenote  im a streamer  so im perfectly fine speaking my stream of conscious to an audience im not close to mentally  i feel like that person is me   edit  thank you all for your responses  this really blew up  to answer the main question ive gotten  and probably should have put in here originally  i think my fear when meeting people is that ill say something and the person will take it the wrong way and then hate me  this happened to me a few years ago  and while ive let go of the people for the most part  i still fear it happening again  ,0
social butterfly  not sure if my advice would be helpful or not im a social butterfly as the title suggests  when i found this sub i thought oh man  this is something im good at maybe i could offer my advice and help someone    reading the posts made me think my advice might seem like overly simple to those who are really struggling socially    like way too far ahead from where theyre at so that it seems almost comical to suggest  like telling someone whos afraid of water to just jump in and start paddling    so a compromise post was made  if anyone wants to know something from the perspective of a social butterfly ask me and ill answer in the comments as best as i can    reddit has a great way of filtering out unpopular content so if my kind of advice isnt helpful to anyone here then ill know by the lack of interaction    blessings on your journeys   edit    welp i went to sleep and this blew up  ill do my best to answer as much as i can today     edit    wowza there are some great responses in this thread  some seriously good advice that i didnt give but that i would give  if i dont answer you directly its because there is great advice already under your question   edit    okay im burning out a bit here so im going to chill on responses  if i havent gotten to yours im sorry  ill try to answer some more as i can  please read through everyones great advice  sending so much love and light your way friends    you have no idea how much you all have impacted me today  i think you guys really made a profound difference in me today so thank you  ,0
advice  if someone doesnt like you  dont try to change their mind because they probably wont ever like you this is a huge problem i struggle with  if someone doesnt like me  ill do everything in the book to try to change their opinion of me  try to be funny  do favors  compliment them  offer advice  etc  it wont work  if someone doesnt like you they just dont    its a tough pill to swallow but its necessary   yes  friendship can grow by doing those things  but if someone doesnt like you to begin with or barely likes you it wont help   ive wasted countless hours trying to  win  a friendship  it doesnt work  move on to someone who actually like and appreciates you   ,0
why does everyone interrupt me when i talk  seriously  i never talk ever because of how i grew up in my household  it was always better to just keep your opinion to yourself  so  normally i don t talk that much  but sometimes i want to talk and every time i do people always interrupt me  no one ever listens to what i say  i don t know if its because i haven t met any nice human beings yet or if its just me    im just so annoyed right now  i feel like i can never get my voice heard because everyone butts me out of the conversation and sometimes i want to be heard  sometimes i want to talk to people  i dont have many friends either  none that listen to me  thanks if you read my rant   edit  i appreciate everyone explaining to me all the possible reasons and giving me options on how to improve my way of speaking and conversational habits   ,0
finally made the move so i met this girl about a week and a half ago  earlier this week  we went to grab coffee and ended up talking for over   hours  tonight we went to get dinner and ended up hanging out for    hours  i am  for some annoying reason  way too hesitant to make the first move to show her i mean more than just being friends  we watched a movie and were cuddling and all but i just couldn t get myself to do it without feeling ultra uncomfortable  i just walked her home and at the door i kissed her  now  while i definitely should have made the move earlier  i am ecstatic that i did it  hoping to see her again soon  thought this would be the appropriate group to share this with after lurking for a few months   ,0
how to talk to people you see everyday  ive always had this problem where i feel supremely awkward when trying to make small talk with either coworkers or customers that i see everday  its like by the third time i see you  ive run out of things to say  this makes me feel like im distancing myself from the other coworkers and getting told that i dont talk enough to customers  i feel awkward greeting the same coworkers everyday with how are you doing or telling coworkers  fine  when they ask me that with the conversation then ending    how do i talk to people i see everyday in a more natural way  ,0
a word of advice  if you are trying to improve  pick one  week day to stay off reddit one fault of my own is that i will look at all the great advice in this subreddit and then not do any of it because i m still stuck in the how of social interaction  in fact  a lot of the time i will go on here looking for advice only to stay on and miss opportunities to improve my social skills   so my advice would be this    pick one day in the week to focus on applying what you learned    i would recommend either monday or friday but as long as you are actually practicing you can t go wrong  use that day and take note of what you did  what you improved and what progress you still want to make  reddit can feel like socializing but it is in your best interest to turn some of your browsing time into time spent making new friends and creating connections   there is no advice on here that can replace actually going out and making yourself vulnerable  watching sports isn t going to make you an athlete  going to an art gallery won t make you van gogh  and getting advice without applying it will get you nowhere  ,0
how can i stop overthinking and analysing everything whenever im with some i find myself reading too much about the situation  how can i stop caring and just enjoy the time ,0
people with healthy self esteem don t only think highly of themselves  they also assume others do too  a lot of your anxiety can be boiled down to fear of judgement  the problem is that you re always being told not to care what other people think  it s okay to care what people think  what you need most is to start believing that people think the best of you until proven otherwise  your belief that everyone thinks you re boring  stupid  etc is one of the things holding you back  mark manson put it best  just pretend  pretend that the other person in front of you thinks highly of you  that they think you are dope or whatever and truly express who you are  what you feel and what you think don t look for signs of disapproval it s very weird the way life will fit to your reality when your beliefs change    notice when you re anxious around someone and pretend they think highly of you  let the fears flow away  if you believe someone thinks you re alright awesome then you re not going to sweat it even when you make mistakes  you know they think you re great either way ,0

i have a weird habit of becoming suddenly tearful when i speak from the heart  i can speak calmly and confidently in most situations  but occasionally when i say something that i really believe in with all my heart  i will begin to tear up  regardless of whom im talking to   its very annoying  it feels like i surprised myself with the force of the truth i just said and feel a surge of emotion  i think it may be related to self consciousness  does anybody else know what im describing  can i fix it  its hard for me to feel like im speaking authoritatively when i keep tearing up at random things i said  ,0
you need to love yourself before other people will love you  things will work out  a lot of people really need to hear this  they wonder why despite them seemingly doing everything right  they dont have that many friends  or find it difficult to get people to talk to or open up to them   this might be you  or someone you know  but there are people everywhere who need to know this   you need to love yourself before you expect anyone anywhere to love or even like you  after all  if the one person who should care the most about you doesnt  why should anyone else   this doesnt mean you have to change who you are  no  self love is unconditional  you love yourself no matter what  at the end of all of this  things are going to be okay  they might not have gone the way you wanted to  but you still have yourself and at the end of the day  thats everything you could possibly ask for   some of you might be asking   i get that this is important to my own happiness  but why is it important to others   and the simplest answer to that is that your love of yourself completely changes the way you approach any social situation from public speaking to the most intimate of conversations to even putting yourself in places to talk to people in the first place  your confidence  your charisma  all of these things skyrocket when you know in the back of your head  things are going to work out regardless of what happens   when you dont love yourself  when youre not confident in who you are  almost every little thing you do shows that  when you tell a joke  you might taper off near the end  you might lose confidence nearing the punchline because no ones laughing  or you might decide not to tell a joke at all because youre afraid it wont go over well when the single most important part of telling a joke isnt whats in it  but that you deliver it with so much confidence in the fact that its funny that it invariably turns out to in fact be funny    when you love yourself  you show the world around you that no matter its preconceptions or prejudices of you  youre an absolute rockstar that people want to talk to  it doesnt matter what you look like  sound like  although it does matter what you smell like   youre the person people are going to gravitate to when you walk into a room  youre the dude or dudette of the hour and people are going to know the moment they see you coming   you see  the one thing that almost always unconsciously drives people away are your insecurities in yourself  not because they have any value on their own  but because   you   give them that value  when you take that away  when you love yourself despite your issues  which if you can  you should still work on  but for  yourself  and not for others  all that remains is confidence  and confidence is the key to charisma   edit  reading some comments i realize how this post might sound like its impossible to be loved if you dont love yourself  please dont let that be the message you take away  from this  thats wrong too  everyone has people who would do anything and everything for them  even if they dont fully love themselves  i made this post mostly for people who who despite following everything this subreddit and other sources tell you  seem to struggle with meeting new people  the point was that your self love and acceptance is the best way to brew confidence  not that youre unlovable without it  everyone is capable and deserving of love  ,0
i m going to do my absolute best to socialize and meet new people at my university sorry if this gets long  i feel like i have to put it out there   school begins for me this thursday as a freshman and i ve made a vow to myself to talk to as many people as i can  high school was pretty difficult for me since i always kept to myself and my very small friend group and never made it a priority to try and build new relationships  after realizing that i m pretty alone now that i m going into my university i know that it s going to be a whole lot tougher if i don t go out of my comfort zone and make a good effort to socialize    i think of myself as an introvert  especially thinking back to high school  but i want to rebuild myself this year  it feels like a real fresh start for myself and a chance build a new social life there  and that s an opportunity i don t want to mess up  i know i m going to have to go through a lot of awkward moments or encounter others that might not want to talk to me  but i know that i have to keep going no matter what  it s going to be a big year for me and i want to give it my all  wish me luck  and to the other people that have similar goals  you guys can all do it  all it takes is the confidence to put ourselves out there  ,0
how do i stop fantasizing and creating unrealistic expectations about others  whenever i find someone attractive or that has a vibe that i like  i start to fantasize about them  a lot  it can go from innocent made up  scenes  like going out to the movies  watching the sun set  to sexual fantasizes  i thought all of this was normal  which it is  fantasizing and imagining doing stuff with people  but i have realized its now a problem  fantasizing leads me to create expectations about this person  i think i know them when i dont know them at all and when i finally have a chance to interact with them i act awkwardly because i know that ive been imagining them in these weird messed up circumstances in my head  how can i stop fantasizing  or at least know how to approach fantasizing in a healthy way  and not become this awkward mess in front of others  ,0

i have started to distance myself from others  and it feels fantastic  for better or for worse  i spent probably too long caring about what others thought of me  i didn t when i was in my early to mid teens  but from       i surely did  anxiety and depression mixed with some very traumatic experiences in early adulthood    i never did anything considered  different   my friends were are pretty boring in the sense that they just weren t very interesting or inspiring people  they weren t idiots  but they certainly weren t super intelligent either    i have always been a bit different  i love good food   fancy  alcohols like wine and whiskey  art  movies  poetry  science  mathematics  videogames  don t play them anymore as i think they re a bit of a waste of time   but i have always loved music  i never played an instrument until january       electric guitar    edit  this was written in one go  kind of unedited  these are just a few examples of some things  i certainly don t think i m super quirky or special or different for liking any of these things  where i come from  some of these things just aren t really commonplace  thanks       i fell in love with a girl at university  she didn t feel the same after we had a short lived fling  and it made me reflect that i wasn t who i wanted to be and had a huge impact on attempting to recreate myself  i am definitely a bit odd  some say interesting  funny  moody  very straight forward blunt but always considerate and caring  i never try to put people down but encourage them  sometimes people will say or do rude things to me to put me down  it s just that i can be much  much harsher in retaliation   anyhow  i just stopped hanging out with people who were clearly not evolving or changing  they were too scared to  and still are  i feel like we have grown apart because of this  like they are hindering my own personal growth   i dropped my social media friends  went from     followers to     i m back up to    now  if people want to refollow me they can  this has also helped me in not caring about others opinions a tonne  i can post what i want to post and don t have to worry about likes or follows  i m not saying i m better than these people i knew  i still see them from time to time  one or two of them i really do love as we share the same interests and passions and i hung on to them  as far as playing the guitar goes  i have devoted my time to it and progressed very far  wrote my own music  and hope to soon be in a band for mere personal enjoyment    i enjoy other things  i recently bought a mountain bike  i have always tinkered with cars and spent considerable amounts fixing and breaking them  my  friends  always gave me shit for it  and still do  but these are things that i have loved for a long long time  and i do it all alone  sure it s good to be with others  but dancing to the beat of your own drum is extremely cathartic  don t let others bring you down  i m sorry if this comes off as pretentious but i really feel a big shift in my life and am stoked to start building from here    does anyone have the same experience and have anything to share or add  thanks for reading  this is my second post on reddit and feel it s a great platform to unload such thoughts     ,0
i promise you that making eye contact and smiling or nodding to the person youre passing on the sidewalk will defuse any awkwardness  so many people feel awkward passing by someone on the sidewalk heading towards each other  people will make an effort to look in every direction but the approaching person  or theyll look for a distraction   i find that if you just briefly establish eye contact  dont look away immediately   and give a smile or and a nod  this defuses any feeling of awkwardness  at least  it does for me  rather than trying to avoid the situation  its an acknowledgement of the other person and the situation the two of you are in   plus  i find that it makes me happy  little interactions with strangers  little salutations brighten my day  especially getting a smile back  it might seem difficult at first  but i urge you to try it     edit    it would seem ive severely underestimated peoples capacity to overthink things  at this point i feel kind of like im writing a definitive rulebook for passing a stranger on the sidewalk haha   what ill say is this  i acknowledge that there are cultural differences and perhaps where youre from its uncommon  however  i very much doubt that anyone will think youre some kind of psycho pervert as some people seem to think  youre projecting your insecurities my friends  ,0
people think im on drugs but ive never tried drugs in my life  people  from family to friends to online and work always think im on drugs when i am just happy and energetic and smile and dance and generally having fun ok i guess not dancing in work  and it bothers me and gets me down   even strangers when im out with friends and dance like crazy for   hours straight with no break approach me and ask me where to get the drugs i take    whats this stigma and why do people hate  i guess   the fact im actually enjoying my life time out  shall i just not give a fuck and power through their comments and stares   edit  i get like this when writing  can write    pages of quality material in a day   also in dnd i play this type of character that has a dual identity the social and the sm in the shadows  maybe this reflects me irl   edit   people ask if i have adhd  bipolar  nope  i was afraid i might have something in the past and went to a psychiatrist and   different psychologists  to get more opinions  and they all  after some sessions  told me im normal and i should not worry  i just have social anxiety and dont get all the interpersonal cues was the only thing one of them told me and helped me improve on it  i do though get highs and lows  but even on my really lows i am always trying to escape to singing  dancing  writing or going out  if work permits it  and make the most out of my  low  times  that usually cheers me up a bit and makes me feel accomplished in a way    as for blood check ups for thyroid etc came out perfect   edit   i usually forget things or dont pay attention to conversations i find boring  when im hyper  even doing logistics for work i need a lot of small breaks to blast off some energy else cant concentrate at all     edit  thanks for all thd kind replies  it really means a lot to me  ,0
how to increase your self esteem if you have high self esteem  then you can have essentially any type of social life that you want   the truth is that people will almost always think about you the way you think about yourself  the way you think about yourself is communicated in many different ways   in your body language and your verbal language  for example   so if you dont like yourself  or dont find yourself to be particularly interesting  or if youre constantly mad at yourself   you will find people holding similar attitudes toward you   but if you can start loving yourself more than you ever have  giving yourself praise  giving yourself more space  then you can absolutely develop a strong self esteem that everyone will gravitate to and want to hang around      you are valuable  and you belong   you are piece of the universe  if you exist  then thats evidence enough that you belong here  how could something exist and not belong  could you go out into a forest  pick up a leaf and criticize it  could you find something wrong with it  would the universe be better  without  that leaf  i think that youll find the answer is no   so many of us carry this idea that theres something wrong with us  that were somehow flawed  marred  or  came out of the factory wrong   its just an idea  its not true   it might be true that you  judge yourself  as wrong  flawed  or marred  but thats just a judgement  and not reality   please make a commitment to yourself  right now  that you will no longer accept any ideas into your mind that youre some kind of a foreigner to the planet  you were made of this earth  and you belong on this earth  there is space for you  there is room for you  there is air for you  there is food for you   you bring something to this place that no one else can bring  the universe is more with you here  not less       be a  steward  for yourself  a steward is the one who looks after something  who is the caretaker of something   be your own caretaker  take good care of yourself  listen to yourself  love yourself  speak to yourself the way youd speak to someone you admire  someone you have a crush on  someone who you respect   remember your awesomeness  remember your creativity  remember what you said you were going to do when you were a kid  start tapping into your memory of being powerful  of being light  excited  in flow  and free       remember that youre free   i admit im jumping around topics here  thanks for following a long    remember that youre free  you are   remember that when you do something from a place of obligation  or duty  or  sunk cost fallacy    whatever it is   no one controls you  ultimately  you decide what you do with your body  with your time  you decide  even if a gun is to your head  you decide   you didnt come here to do please everybody and make them happy  if who you are makes people happy  then thats enough  you didnt come here to make everybody have a good opinion about you  remember  that you dont care about peoples opinion of you  you dont  not really   be free  be your best friend  be your own steward  love yourself  you deserve more love  always more love  and remember that you belong   thanks       more here  if you like   https   www reddit com r spirituality comments    fu  do you need some  on  help with what youre going   ,0

if youre feeling stagnant  alone  and frustrated  read this to clear your mind and feel better  its easy for the common man to throw up his hands and proclaim   i give up  this is worthless   it takes a courageous man to say  i am everything  with enough hard work  i will make it   and go on to prove it   right now  you are feeling frustrated and angry that your goals are not coming to fruition  and you are about to give up  dont  here are some words of encouragement to push you forward   this should be obvious  but it helps to be reminded that nothing worth anything in life comes easily  it has been written many times that those who have achieved greatness failed thousands of times before they made a breakthrough  you probably havent failed even one hundred times  being who you are  there is a tendency to dramatize everything  distorting reality  and eventually giving up mentally and physically  you must catch yourself in these foolish moments  and remind yourself that it could take up to a decade to master a skill  do not be like the quitters who give up within their first year  do not let your fear of failure overshadow your desire to be great   there is tendency for you to procrastinate on your responsibilities because you cannot bear to be humbled by the fact your skills are more lackluster than you thought  this is the mark of a boy  a man realizes that the rewards of the long term far outweigh the situation of the present  and so he continues to set his emotions aside  and work  work until the desired end result is achieved  for as long as the work is put in  the end result is guaranteed  have confidence you will arrive  and soon you will   do not compare yourself to others  do not worry about what others are doing  you have no idea what is going on behind the scenes  only what they present to you  how can you be sure that they are telling the truth about the amount of time it took them   for example   to get good at drawing  or whether the work they present is their own  there isnt a way to truly know and it does not matter  your journey is ultimately your own and as long as you are doing everything you have to do and maintaining discipline  it will take as long as it needs to for you to achieve your desired result   relax  there will be days of rapid progress  just as there will be periods of stagnation  understand that both are completely normal and you shouldnt feel any intense attachment towards either  attachment to rapid progress will form unrealistic expectations of yourself  ending in disappointment  attachment to periods of stagnation will cause your mind to go to dark places  experience chronic frustration  and you will eventually give up   the solution to this is to adopt an attitude of indifference  a mindset that effectively says   i dont care about this situation im in  only my goal  as long as im showing up everyday  ill get there   this attitude will help you embrace boredom  and failure more   as previously stated  this path towards reaching your goals has left you currently frustrated and angry  and probably ready to give up  dont  be the courageous man that says to himself   i am everything   and sets out to prove it  ,0
anyone else very  literal   i m really smart academically  but      sometimes i take things too literally  the other day  some people were talking about laptops  and one person said  yeah my laptop is really old  i actually have to wind it up to get it to work  and i went  woah  really   then realised a second later that they were joking  in fairness  i had had a bad night s sleep the night before so perhaps that contributed  another example i have is a friend was like  yeah i m catching the plan to spain this evening  and i was like  oh wow  are you   and again  they were joking   i like to be quite  specific  in the things i say so i don t tend to make jokes like that and i assume others are the same way  which is probably why i don t get it  i do use sarcasm quite a lot eg   yep  carry on standing in the doorway  it s not as if you re blocking the exit or anything  lol  and i do get it when others do that too  the examples i gave above seem more like  exaggerations  which i don t do or get so well    my sister is actually similar  or used to be  so perhaps it s to do with the way we were raised  our family doesn t really  joke  in the ways i ve described    i feel like i do that often  not constantly  but fairly often  can anyone relate  ,0
is anyone else a private extrovert and public introvert   when i came back to my home city after my first year in university  it dawned on me that i dont know how to make friends in everyday situations  ive only ever made friends from elementary to high school because it was low effort  although i havent maintained most of those friendships up to date   and in university because i was in a social environment where i didnt have to try hard to find others  i have three best friends who ive maintained since high school  and other than them  i rarely see other people on a daily basis when im at home  ive fell off from pretty much everyone else from high school  particularly because my grade was super cliquey and everyone kinda just stuck to their inner circles  i love my friends and appreciate them a lot  but sometimes i do get lonely  sad because i see my other friends from university having a blast with their big friend groups from their home towns  i do have other friend groups in my city  but theyre kind of scattered and i could never imagine all my friend groups mixing  i know it seems shallow  but i do wish i had a big friend group  even if it was just an  outer circle   where i had a lot of people i was comfortable hanging out with  along with very few people that are super close to me  i feel like because i never had that growing up  i missed out on a lot of experiences  or whatever people fantasize their memories of their youth to be like  now that im an  adult  im finding it so hard to make friends  probably because ive never had to step out of my comfort zone and actually do it before  im not softspoken or shy in public  but im pretty closed off  im friendly  but most people dont tend to get close to me because i dont really share much about myself  i think that when people talk to me  they feel like the conversation isnt really personal since i never let my guard down and i always put up a face  i do this with my coworkers  and in classroom situations too  and ive done this pretty much all through elementary to high school   which is why although a lot of people knew me and had talked to me  i never was close to anyone  i guess my main struggle right now is finding a way to be myself and be comfortable around people i wanna know better  and actually making an extra effort to find friends  because its so much harder when youre older  does anyone else face these same problems or am i alone here      ,0
i know why i haven t found a girlfriend yet  i just haven t talked to a lot of women  you always see guys who ask why they don t have a girlfriend  but i already know my reason    the problem is i haven t talked to enough girls  i m in college and this should be the best time to find love and hooking up  but the problem is i think i have social anxiety  every time there is an opportunity for me to talk to a really pretty girl i never take the chance  just yesterday i had a chance to talk to this really cute girl who was by herself and i just blew it away    it s so frustrating because i know the solution i just can t get myself to actually do it  it seems so difficult to do  it also doesn t help that i m literally a depressed loner    i just want to find someone who loves me     update  woah was not expecting this post to blow up  read most of the advice and i agree with what you guys are saying  ,0
i overcame my social anxiety    so i was playing basketball with one of my only friends and then those   hot girls went just    meters away from us to this huge swing where   people can be at the same time we have such things in estonia   we just continued playing but i felt like we should go and talk to them or something  and then we thought fuck it  lets just go and talk to them they go to the same school as i and i knew one of the girls name but i alwayd had thought that im not cool enough to hang out with such cool girls   and we ended out hanging out for a few hours and it seemed that they had acctually great time  it gave me a huge confidence push and i think that it was a perfect thing for me to do   ,0
i    m  have never set foot in a bar  what drink s should i order  im the neurotic type who has to intimately plan out everything i get scared about  mostly because i become a stuttering mess when put on the spot  thanks anxiety    im going to a bar soon with a friend  and its the first time ive ever been  so im wondering what sort of drinks everyone likes to order  preferably something relatively easy to say  ive fucked up ordering hot chips before       x   b   also if you have any tips for general etiquette that would be cool too  i live in australia for what its worth   thanks  ,0
how i stopped being socially embarrassed in middle school i was super shy   like majorly  i didn t have a single friend in elementary school  but in middle school i wanted to change that   the problem  i was mortified by doing anything out of the ordinary around people  i decided that was dumb and had a revelation that nobody cared  did i care if someone was doing something out of the ordinary   no  so why should i think people would judge me  i did an experiment  in school we would go to a large grass circle with red tables surrounding it  some people say on the grass  some at the tables  but no one sat in the middle  everyone could see you  you d basically be on display  so every day  for a long time  i would sit exactly in the middle and eat  it was terrifying   everyone in school could see  but i realized that no one was really looking  so i took it up a little  on fridays my school would bring out speakers at lunch and play music  i would go out and dance  very badly  in the middle of the quad  people laughed  not sure if with me or at me  but i didn t care  kids started joining  eating lunch closer to the middle and even after i stopped you could see groups of kids dancing  the principal danced with me  i practiced and practiced embarrassing myself and now i am free to do whatever i need to  i literally didn t pay attention when people were mean or bullying  that is how middle school turned into great years of my life  ,0
how i started to find other people more interesting it always felt like an uphill battle trying to meet new people because i always felt bored   i kept looking to find  interesting  people  but couldnt find anyone to connect with my interests so  naturally  my conclusion was  people are lame and not interesting    and people could smell that mindset from miles away so theres no way in hell theyd invest any conversational effort in someone who obviously wasn t interested in them   no wonder no one wanted to open up to me  i was so obsessed with how  interesting  i thought that i was that i couldn t see it in anyone else   owch      so how did i become more interested in others   the traditional advice of  find something in common  is half right  yes  it s an open door to start a conversation  but its not the house that we live our relationships in   something in common  is an opportunity to connect  but its not the end goal of a relationship    we dont become friends with someone only because they like the same spcific shit that we do  the real meat of a relationship is in how we make each other feel    for example  i fucking love metal  specifially djent  prog  black  and sludge       of the people on the planet dont give a shit about these genres  and thats totally groovy with me  baby  if my criteria to consider someone interesting was  must enjoy these genres of music   im missing out on all the other millions of types of friends to be made out there   and even then  when i meet someone who likes the exact same things  i mean exactly everything i like  what if this rare  magical person i met is a complete dickhead who is a flat earther who doesnt believe in showers   insisting that someone perfectly mirrors your every like   dislike is a sure path to being lonely   so do i give up on trying to connect on metal   of course not    connection is about emotion   it s far more relatable to others to talk about the way the music makes me feel  then listing off obscure bands  crushing heavy metal riffs make me feel energized  capable of making a difference  and validated  those exact same emotions could happen in other people when listening to nu disco  or motown  or any other billions of different genres   here s an example of two different responses to someone asking  what music are you into    a  oh i m a big fan of  list of band names   have you heard of them    b  i m a metal head  it s my favorite thing to listen to with the windows down driving way too fast at night    notice how much more emotional meat the second answer gives you to chew on   thats how you connect to others  emotion   if someone tells me theyre into bluegrass  which isnt my favorite   i dont leave it as a  huh  neat   i put some emotion sauce on this double patty emotionburger with a  hmm  i dont know too much about bluegrass  what is it about bluegrass that you really like     i love the storytelling     oh yeah     yeah  like my favorite band has a song where         hah  thats great  one of my favorite albums is the story of moby dick  but in metal form    this keeps the conversation moving by talking about music  but the emotion it makes it feel  not listing off names and hoping a few match       ok so theory is great  but i bet youre looking for concrete steps   heres how i started getting better at making other people interesting      memorize a few simple but effective questions as your go to conversation list as a way to move someone s conversational statement to a more emotional context    heres some examples ive used  but feel free to add to   remove questions to your own personal list as you see what works well for you      how did you become so interested in x    why do you like x    i noticed x  whats the story behind that    whats your story  howd you end up at  this job  city  school  orgy  etc       when someone gives you a meaty answer  not just a yes or no   find the emotional content within the answer and respond to that  what makes you feel that way  or when have you felt similar      if the answer seems like it might have more meat to it but theyre holding back a bit  hit them with a  tell me more  or other phrase that gives them persmission to be interesting   and thats it   itll be difficult the first few times  but as you try out this process  pay attention to what does and doesnt work  youll slowly become better and better at personal questions  the more you focus on testing your questions and skills  the quicker youll get better   good luck  feel free to hit me up if you want to talk more  ,0
how do i not cry when standing up for myself  one of my co workers is constantly giving me attitude  i had to ask him for help a couple times one day and both times he shrugged me off like  that is not our priority right now  and left me to fend for myself with angry customers   this was during a rush while i was alone at the back window and he had the other headset  first time the receipt printer wasnt working so no one was getting their receipts  second time i was running out of space in the register and had to have a manager change it out but he refused to get someone   then today  they put me on the grill for the first time and after a couple hours he came in and it was just the two of us  the dude before him was telling me to do something a certain way so i kept doing it  and mr  happy man yelled at me about it  he isnt like this to anyone else  it sounds dumb when i type it out but this dude just hates my guts  its not just him being hard on me to help me do the job right  hes just extremely rude about everything  my point is  i cry when im stressed  i want to stand up for myself and basically tell this guy to stop being so rude to me all the time  but i know for a fact i will burst into tears if i do that  does anyone else have the same problem with crying and do you know how i could say something to this dude without bawling  if not  it was good to vent anyway   edit  i did not expect this much attention  i appreciate every one of you so much  still not sure what my approach is here  but if it comes up again i think you guys gave me enough of a confidence boost that ill be able to say something  ,0
my social skills drop drastically when im depressed i try to act normal but its like everyone can sense it  i became anxious and fearful all the time and i dread having to interact with someone even if i want to  im afraid theyll find me boring and hate me    i got completely left out of conversations and hang outs the past   weeks  its getting worst by the day and i fear losing everyone  i dont really have anyone close enough that i can open up to   maintaining mental health feels like walking a tight rope  i just came out of a depressive episode and here i am  losing balance and falling again  ,0
don t want to sound sad but i m    and feel like every time i make friends they like me for a bit and then go off into their own groups without me  i try to be good friend but now it just seems like i don t deserve friends update  i just wanna say thank you to everyone for the support  after reading your comments i know things will get better for me someday  ,0
how to not become bitter due to negative social experiences  i don t understand this but maybe it s because of my personality type  but i rarely seem to have positive experiences with people in general   i grew up dealing with aspergers as a young kid  which has affected me socially throughout my life  now that i m     while i m still professional and kind towards others  i realized i ve become a bit more bitter and closed off towards others   i ve never had a group of friends i could rely on and my work experiences always seem to be uphill battles with other people  i do have some positive experiences with others at times  but i ve generally discovered that people seem to enjoy taking out their frustration out on me   reflecting on my past experiences  i realized i no longer want to deal with other people and i m actually grateful with this current virus situation because it allows me to work from home for the foreseeable future   anyways i apologize for ranting just needed to get this off my chest  ,0

i ve been practicing so i can eventually talk to a guy   i m proud of what i ve done recently  i have always been super shy and reserved  i have an oddly hard time making eye contact when speaking or saying hi to people that i know but aren t very close with  i m super super shy around guys especially    i m a freshman athlete in college and i met this guy on the football team    i think he s really cute and he seems sweet  but i ve never talked to him yet and he s also shy  so he won t talk to me lol or maybe he s just not interested   i ve been disappointed with my dating  social life forever as i have   close guy friend and haven t had a bf ever  i feel like i m not putting myself out there enough to get noticed  or i just seem uninterested bc i won t make eye contact lol  however  i want to practice and work my way up to having a few guy friends and maybe even talk to the football boy    here s the fun part  before break started  i became friendlier and forced myself to ask questions with a guy who s friends with my friend  just something simple  a bit of practice talking to guys in general  but then  a different cute football boy sat next to me while i was having a laughing spell  mental breakdown from finals  and i felt like he got to see the more fun and open side of me  he joined in with me and my friends convo and made me laugh even more  and we introduced ourselves to each other     and the next day  i said hi to him and even engaged in a tiny conversation     progress      i have no idea why i struggle so bad to talk to guys even if they re just friends  i even struggle to talk to my closest guy friend back home bc i feel really shy around him  i m working on it though and i ve been practicing eye contact and saying hello to people    i know i m overreacting a bit about having a tiny convo  but i felt really proud of myself for forcing me to just do it  and now i have another guy friend    edit  i can t believe how much positive attention this has gotten  thank you all so much for all the advice and such  i m excited to go back to school after break and work on my skills more  this was a big confidence booster   ,0

started playing d d and now i feel like a social skills god       ok  maybe i am exaggerating a bit    last year my friend dragged me along to a rpg campaign and i really didnt think it would be my thing  the thought of role playing and having to talk to a group of people was my idea of a bad time  at first  when i was new to the game i would sit there just listening until the story reached some combat or the dm directly addressed me about what i wanted to do  i was also much the same in everyday social situations     x   b   fast forward to present day where i am contributing much more in the game and i now go out of my way to interact with other humans in day to day life       loving how d d has been helping with my confidence interacting with the humans  even asked a girl out on a date  she is now the unfortunate owner of me as a boyfriend for over   months now   ,0
im a cab driver  i used to be much more socially anxious  heres something ive noticed  id like to propose that two things are true  i might be totally wrong  but these two things seem generally true from my observations      there is something about socializing that is an exercise  like all exercise  if you stop for a while  your muscles become weak     there are two kinds of people  those who need to be in conversation  those who dont   while it is true that there are generally types of people who need to be conversation  women   just about everybody at some point in their lives feels the uncomfortable desire to converse   the people who feel the need to talk will tell you in their own way  they will invite you to small talk with them these people understand that conversation is a burden on all participants  and since they are  conversation beggars  who need to converse to feel comfortable  they dont often act as choosers    they appreciate any kind of talking  it doesnt matter if youre reading the back of a cereal box  so long as your voice sounds conversation like  they will accept the background noise and respond in turn   if this type of person is your conversation buddy  i advise you to take the reigns  dont second guess anything that comes to your mind  say the cheesiest most cliche word vomit you can think of  and dont let up  you can talk about the individual raindrops from the cloud that blew through town for twenty minutes yesterday  the conversation beggar will be grateful and satisfied   the second type of person is someone who does not feel the need to converse its simple  just dont speak to them unless conversation arises organically or you have something important to say  dont be a conversation beggar to a conversation chooser   as a final point  its important to give everyone the chance to show you if theyre interested in small talk or not  give everyone the chance to show you if theyre interested in conversation before you assume theyre not  ,0
negative experience going to a show alone last night i    m  am new to this city and just moved into a new house  due to being new in the city i didnt have anyone to go to a concert with so i decided to go by myself  didnt feel at first that it was that big of a deal  ive gone to concerts alone before and typically had a fun time    i get in  order a beer and post up  as the first opener starts playing people start crowding in as to be expected  i am a tall and big guy so ive always been self conscious at shows from bumping into people and being in their way of seeing the show    i kept to myself  not really talking with anyone  but there were several instances where people i was standing by were talking about me and it felt like shit   i wasnt doing anything but standing there and bobbing to the music  which i guess might have been weird  but one girl who was in front of me for a bit was talking about me being weird and then i took my phone out in between sets and she says oh great this guys taking a picture of my ass and that couldnt be farther from the truth    i eventually moved to another part of the club but still felt like i was a topic of conversation for some people  i think its a mix of my anxiety making me feel paranoid and making it seem worse but there were definitely people commenting      x   b   the show was great and i chatted with some of the band members and got a record signed but what otherwise would have been a really awesome night got ruined cause all i can think about is me being a creep or at least people interpreting me as being such  just feels bad and has been an overall setback for my anxiety  which has been really under control the past couple of years     x   b    edit  just wanted to say thanks to everyone for responding  i really appreciate the kind words and support and will do my best not to dwell too hard on this experience  or at least the negative aspects   ,0
when holding a conversation  think less about what to say  and more about what the person is saying  then be open with your ideas  i tend to overthink how to hold a conversation  which makes it so i am not focusing on the actual matter ,0
very simple tip that will guarantee you to be more well liked and people will like to be around you  i always practice  leave people better than you found them   for example when im walking through campus and i have a conversation with somebody i would make sure to give them a compliment or any word play that would make their day better  tell someone you liked their  shoes  you missed them  tell them they made a good decision when discussing something  you like their hair today  good job on that test  nice i think you can do better  etc  it could be anything so simple such as a good morning to buying someone lunch  just leave em better than you found them  people will start gravitating toward you because their brains will associate good vibes around you   ,0
i feel bad that i don t find it as fun as others to go out partying i feel like i am an introvert but not socially awkward  it is just energy draining and as said  i dont find it as funny  i want to hang out with funny people but i don t have energy to be around them all day  because of that  i have to  settle  for less  intensive  people  can you learn to have fun  should you feel guilty for not participating in such activities  ,0

no friends and nobody likes me i am a female in my twenties now  and do not have friends   all my life i didnt have many friends  and struggled to make friends  i was always deemed as unlikeable  but i never knew why and to this day i still dont know why  im a kind  nice person  i am selfless and i put other people first  i am told im quirky and funny  yet people still dont want to be friends with me   when i moved away to college  i thought it could be a nice fresh start to meet loads of new people  and make connections  at the start  i would talk to a lot of people and everyone was friendly  and i was friendly to everyone  but as time has gone on  those people that i made friends with have distanced themselves away from me  this happens every time  sometimes people are happy to get to know me  but as soon as they do  they dont want anything to do with me and distance themselves  every time i make a new friend  i lose them pretty quickly  in some way or another  i dont know why that is  it must be something to do with my personality  it makes me feel so crappy about myself  i feel like im not good enough for anyone  i spend days wondering what it is about me that people dislike so much  every time i get to know a person and start becoming friends  i get frightened that they will leave soon as well  like everyone else   in my whole life  i have only had a few friends combined  and after some time a lot of them ended up confessing that they never really liked me  or one has said after a long   year friendship that she just doesnt want to be seen with me anymore and doesnt ever want to talk to me again  which was heartbreaking    has anyone experienced something similar  does anyone have any advice  i dont want advice how to make friends  as i have no problem meeting people and talking to them to get to know them  i just have a problem where people that get to know me dont like me  im baffled as i dont know what im doing wrong   i tried therapy and talking this through with a therapist and it didnt help   update  thank you for so many replies  i wasnt expecting so many people to reply and to relate to me  thank you for all the advice  im trying to reply to everyone   to all the people that relate to me  just know that you are not alone with this and there are so many more people like yourself  anyone can message me at any point and we can be friends  if you want someone to talk to    another update  thank you for all the private messages  i have received an overwhelming amount so i may take a little longer to reply to everyone    ,0
i think i escaped an actual psychopath  howdy everyone  this isn t so much of a post on social skills or advice  rather a story  however  if i can give you anything i would definitely warn against being too  go with the flow  or passive   so last night i went to grab a drink at my local spot and was approached by a group of women who asked me to join them as i was by myself  i wasn t really in the mood  but i went with them anyway    we find ourselves actually having some pretty decent and interesting conversations when another girl walks right up to the group and asks if she can join  of course we accept and she sits with us    the group gets ready to leave the bar and asks if the new girl that just joined and i if we would like to grab dinner with them  i had to be at work early so i decided to skip out  the new girl says  no thanks  i m going to hangout with this guy  as she points at me  they say goodbye and leave    now this girl is clearly expressing interest and she seems interesting so i decide to stay and chat with her  she s very awkward and shy  but when she spoke she was very intelligent and articulate so she was attractive to me in that regard    she then asks me if i d like to go to an improv comedy show and i accept  now here s where things get a little strange  for me at least    she grabs my hand and pulls me out of the bar running a bit like those kids in high school that bust out the naruto run  no judgment naruto sprinters  it s impressive    we get down to the comedy club go to the bar to grab some drinks and as i m waiting at the bar  she grabs my ass and keeps fondling it  this made me very uncofrmtable because of how fucking awkward it was and how shy her demeanor was  it just felt weird   we grab our drinks and she immediately ditches me to say hi to a former improv dude or something  this guy then comes over to me and asks if i am having sex with her and that he doesn t care  but was clearly heated and out of control  this dude then gets kicked out of the club   already red flags are popping up everywhere and for some reason i just kept going with the flow  i asked her to explain that scenario and she told me about a former boyfriend  who was not that guy at he comedy club     she then becomes incredibly distant and cold whereas before she was holding my hand and groping me  she then says i m taking you to my place  i follow along and we wait at the bus stop    she sits down pulls me onto the street ground and asks a stranger to take a picture of us  i am so incredibly uncomfortable at this point as she is kissing my cheek  she asked me a couple of times if i wanted to make out just there and i somehow managed to ignore the question   let me make it clear that i had no intentions of sleeping with this girl  i get myself into situations like this because i like to observe situations as if i m just an audience or something  yet this isn t a good practice for safe boundaries and i end up being apart of the observation  hopefully that makes sense    anyway   we hop on a bus get to her place and she starts expressing how she needs to get up early for work the next morning  she walks into her bathroom and i see on her mirror written in paint    think don t drink   another red flag   she comes out of the bathroom and i tell her i m going to go home and what not and she says  well wait  how are you getting home  i can give you money  you can crash i just have to work early     this was all so weird and giving me a flighty vibe so decided to be direct and ask before i left   why did you bring me back here  it s no problem at all  just be honest because i m confused and in any case it s all good  i m curious     she laughs and giggles and throws herself onto her bed meanwhile i haven t sat down anywhere once  she starts acting like a child trying to confess something they know is wrong  but with a devious pleasure    she explains and i mean verbatim   okay  i    wanted to wear your skin   i try and think of any other meaning for this when i realize she was being literal  she continues  i wanted to find a fascinating person with nice teeth and bone structure and i met you and i wanted to wear your skin and build you into my machine   she s kind of giggling  but with a sort of release as if she was being vindicated by telling me  but still felt bad for me    i didn t react  although in my head i was screaming  get the fuck out ya here     i calmly asked her what she meant and she repeated herself  a side note that may have no correlation whatsoever  but was interesting to observe  she had a trident tattooed on her hand and the astrological sun sign tattooed on her other hand  in her room she had some gigantic piece of paper that ready  the devil  i am devil  but the rest of the writing was very small and i couldn t read it    i told her that it was nice to meet her and that i had to head off home for work in the morning  she mentioned something about having a male roommate  so now i was a bit cautious that someone was going to ambush me or something as i tried to leave    that same night i head back over to the bar i had started at and tell my bartender buddies of the experience  they ask for her name  search through the system and see that she never tipped and they found her on facebook with her profile picture of me and her on the ground at the bus stop  as well as a picture of me sitting in the bus  i had no idea that she took this  and a picture of one of my bartender buddies  but the back of him only without his knowledge   can someone rationalize this  or is it what it is and this girl has very serious issues   i m genuinely freaked out and want to know what to do about the photos   thanks  ,0
social skill for       use the  strategic yes  to become more social   social skill  saying yes      time to practice  one week    i have a confession to make   i love the movie  yes man  with jim carrey   if youve never seen the movie  the plot  without spoilers  is carrey is a guy who says no to everything  then something crazy happens and he starts saying yes to everything    and his life changes dramatically   this got me thinking  its really easy to say no to things  in fact  it feels like there is an epidemic of  no by default  going on right now   the messaging all around us is     dont say yes and stretch yourself too thin    protect yourself and just default to no    the danger with that line of thinking is that youll miss out on a ton of great experiences    dont get me wrong  saying no is very important in many different areas of life  boundaries are good    but maybe its okay to have a framework to say yes to more things so that you can have great experiences and become more social   id like to suggest a healthy tradeoff       the strategic yes     what if you flipped your default from  no  to  yes  for one week         this means instead of talking yourself out of events  you talk yourself into doing things that youll remember forever   for one week  adopt this mindset  test a  default yes  when      a friend asks you to grab a drink at   pm even though you have work the next day    you see an event that youd normally talk yourself out of   you get asked to go bowling with only    minutes notice   this happened to me a few months ago   went bowling  had a great time   yes  yes  yes   this  strategic yes  mindset is all about you saying yes to yourself and yes to opportunities that you might turn down out of reflex   imagine a circle     my theory is that the more we say yes or no to things over time  the more the circle expands or contracts   if you say no most of the time  the circle becomes almost non existent   if you consistently decline invites  eventually they stop coming because people dont like being turned down consistently    but if you strategically default to yes  youll notice that circle grow      but no one invites me anywhere      heres a post that will help you out with that  just like any skill  youll have to put in some up front work  having conversations  putting yourself  out there   etc   but the alternative is doing the same thing youve always done for another year   time to shift gears for               read it here  https   www becomemorecompelling com blog how to be more social         in the post    start tiny conversations throughout your day  gamify it by learning one new thing about three people per day    how to spark new friendships    how to explore your city  find cool events and go   even if you go solo at first   ,0
a common mistake  overloading people just putting this out there  as its a common mistake that i see others do  and that i occasionally do myself   overloading people   what i mean by  overloading people  is complaining too much  talking about yourself too much  keeping a conversation going too long  etc  for example  you might be talking like this with someone   you   and then this bad thing happened to me    them   wow  that sucks    you   yeah  and then this other bad thing happened  them   thats too bad   you   yeah  but the worst part is that they did this to me after  even though it was unfair    them   sorry to hear that        its emotionally draining to be  them  in the conversation above  its also not very rewarding  they end up just providing you with emotional support and understanding  but dont really get much in return   you can do this in small doses  though  you can complain about something  get some sympathy  and then listen to them  or change the subject to something they want to talk about  or end the conversation  the mistake   and i see this happen a lot with lonely people   is that once they get a person to provide them emotional support  they dont let go  they try to keep it going for as long as possible  in the example above  the person complaining about things would just not stop complaining until the other person ends the conversation or walks away   how does that make the other person feel  they feel tired and annoyed  it wasnt a fun exchange for them  it was draining   so what to do differently  dont talk about your troubles or your life too much  dont let it get one sided  talk about it for    seconds and move on  that way people dont feel drained  this is very hard for lonely people  though  as they feel that finally they are being heard  so they overwhelm the other person  who then runs away    ,0

what do people usually talk about in conversations  i am     and i am born with moderate autism  and one of the ways it had affected me was not being able to have a natural flow in a conversation  i also have no idea how to start a conversation  or what topics i should bring up  i have always had this problem in my life  and i want to try to get rid of it  ,0
someone i thought was cool turned out to be not so great after all so ive been working with this guy for around   years now and have always considered him to be an alright dude  a friend even   however i was left feeling devastated after having to endure a one hour conversation with him yesterday after we both met each other by chance at the railway station   at first it was all going fine  you know  just chopping it up   however as i started to really sink into the conversation i noticed a few notable red flags   the first one was him just being really fucking nasty about what i was doing with my life  at college i study english  and while he has finished university  he was very forward about how i will never prosper in life doing what im doing  which i dont even deny  life is unpredictable  even my mom has said sort of the same thing  however the belittling tone he was continuing to use throughout the entire conversation made the hour feel like a day as he kept talking about how well he will do with his academic scholarship and how much money he will make  he big timed me   another thing i picked up on which really hurt my feelings was when we talked about my instagram  usually  i hate getting my picture taken  im very insecure about the way i look and hate social media in general if im honest  i have actually spoken to this same guy about this but he clearly didnt care as he just shit on my new picture that i uploaded around a week ago   normally i wouldnt ever care about what my mates thought of my instagram  in fact i encorage my mates to make fun of me and vice versa  we are mates after all it means nothing  but he did say with a very serious tone that i looked terrible and would have zero chance of getting laid with a picture like that online    why he thought we were mates like that i have no idea  i did mention that i didnt want to talk about it but he kept saying how ugly i was and he pulled up the picture and pointed to it saying this is why your single   whats messed up is  if it was a closer friend of mine who said it i would have laughed  and said something back but this guy just kept being so serious about it   after he said that i tried desperately to keep quiet but he kept talking about me  and other people at work who i like in a negative way  calling one of my best mates boring and useless   getting home i felt weirdly glad he told me all that stuff  obviously it hurt my feelings  but im happy that i now know what a colossal waste of skin he is  he never struck me as a bad guy before but i really have decided to never be nice to him again  i feel like what he said was way over the line and after a long day of work  being palpably insulted really left me feeling down   im writing this to remind myself to stay around positive people  and to be more positive in general  i grew up around a lot of nasty people and i am so glad that i can recognise when a postive comment makes an impact on someones day  it costs nothing to be nice and i really like learning from experiences like this  ,0
most people arent out to get you   theyre just dumb  ignorant  or made a forgivable mistake  a lesson that took me a long time to learn  i dont know about you all  but i used to have a big problem assuming that people were out to get me and that everything people did that affected me was being done to me  i figured id share a little writeup about what helped me make that realization in my own life in case it was helpful for anyone here at r socialskills   i was biking to the grocery store a few days ago  as i was pedaling along happily  a bright red car door materialized in front of my face     i swerved  i almost fell off my bike  but was able to recover  as soon as i was stabilized  i looked back to yell at the man whod opened the car door and almost killed me      what a     ing dick    i muttered to myself as i pedaled into the parking lot of the grocery store  in that moment  this man was clearly an asshole   or was he   as i walked through the grocery aisles  i realized that id failed to apply hanlons razor to the situation         never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity         most people arent out to get you  hanlons razor is a specific case of occams razor  so to understand it we must first define occams razor    the more assumptions you have to make  the more unlikely an explanation is    assuming someones actions are motivated by malicious intent is a  big assumption   if there are simpler explanations for their actions  those explanations are more likely to be correct   heres a more explicit definition of hanlons razor       never assume malice when stupidity will suffice      never assume stupidity when ignorance will suffice      never assume ignorance when forgivable error will suffice      never assume error when information you hadnt adequately accounted for will suffice   as you work through these explanations  you slowly zoom out to a larger picture of whats going on in a situation   going back to my bike example  the most likely explanation is that he didnt check his mirrors before opening his door  hes not a dick     its a forgivable error  so it falls into category    above     becoming a better human being  by understanding and working hanlons razor into the way you see the world  youll realize a whole host of benefits   youll be less judgmental  if you zoom your perspective out a bit  youll realize that most people are focused on their own lives and how to best get through their days  they dont think about you as much as you might imagine and certainly dont go out of their way to malign you  therefore its far easier to cut them some slack for their actions  especially when those actions affect you   youll develop deeper relationships   youll look at the world more rationally  most of us walk around focused on ourselves all day long  things dont just  happen  during our days  they  happen to us   but this is often not the case  because as weve learned       people can be stupid  even intelligent people     people can make simple mistakes due to being tired  hungry  angry  etc      people can be incompetent     we might not have enough information to see the situation clearly  youll be a more empathetic person  all of the benefits above sum up to an overall increase in your ability to empathize with others  after all  empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another  by seeing their actions more clearly  you can step into their point of view and truly empathize    hanlons razor in relationships  the most obvious and most valuable application of hanlons razor is in relationships  most of us make somewhat machiavellian maneuvers  whether were aware of it or not  were constantly attributing the actions of people around us to all sorts of motivators  most of which are incorrect   we might think that a coworker  knows  were annoyed when he chews with his mouth open  or a boss is intentionally keeping us from the promotion we so clearly deserve  or a significant other doesnt care about us enough to wash the dishes in a timely manner   to escape the trap of false assumptions  picture people as children  children know far less about the world than we do  and often make mistakes that we  rightly  attribute to a lack of experience or knowledge  adults arent so different from children  most of us have massive gaps in our knowledge  skillsets  and social awareness   its far more likely that our coworker is oblivious to the fact that hes chewing with his mouth open  that our boss might be too busy worrying about a more pressing issue in the company and is simply overlooking us  that our significant other has no idea how much were bothered by dirty dishes in the sink    hanlons razor in the media  because of the incentive structure of modern media   see our book short on trust me  im lying for more information  http   thoughtstack co trust me im lying book pdf     media outlets are using emotional triggers in their coverage instead of rationally covering the news   some outlets are bigger offenders than others  but almost all that rely on advertising revenue have a perverse incentive to maximize their page views and clicks  meaning they have become experts at deliberately manufacturing malicious intent when simpler explanations exist   a perfect example is a hit piece by vices motherboard outlet  who released a piece titled  elon musk follows zero women on twitter   shortly after they tweeted the article out  elon responded       motherboard i use twitter for news orgs  my insta has same women as men  whats up with the phoney pc police axe grinding    instead of thinking of a few other reasons besides  elon is a misogynist   vices motherboard pushed the article out  knowing it would spread virally due to the combination of elon being a massive public figure and the anti women implication that the title suggests   becoming familiar with hanlons razor will help you detect when other entities and organizations are  deliberately not applying it  in order to further their own agendas     sometimes  people  are  assholes  the purpose of this piece is to introduce you to hanlons razor and encourage you to add it to your mental toolkit  but dont let it turn into to the proverbial hammer and over apply it in the world   when over applied  you become blind to  actual bad actors in the world   while its rare to encounter a truly malicious person or organization  they  do  exist  attributing every action to stupidity or incompetence would be a mistake  if its more complex for a person to have been acting stupidly or incompetently  it might be the case that they were acting maliciously   not all malice needs to be conscious  its possible for someone to be unconsciously malicious towards us  yet another nuance of interpersonal relationships we need to watch for   hanlons razor belongs in your mental toolkit  but so do a wealth of other mental models that help you navigate the world   this is also a  full length podcast episode  http   thoughtstack co hanlons razor   if youre interested  ,0
when i speak  it is  jagged   i cant form full sentences without long pauses in the middle  am i the only person like this  any ideas on how to improve on this  i started taking a public speaking course  part of toastmasters at work actually  to help with my speaking ability   some feedback that is coming up more frequently is that my speeches are  jagged   it is true  even during a  personal  x  with a friend or coworker    i talk                processing            like this  i will pause mid sentence  in a place that doesnt seem natural    i feel like i have a  slow  mind  it takes a long time to recall a word to use in a sentence or come up with the point i am trying to make    am i the only person like this  sometimes i feel like i could be on the spectrum  but when i bring that up to close friends  they say i am not  idk though      any ideas on how to improve on this  and not sound like i am a buffering youtube video   edit  thank you for all the feedback  i dont have time to look through all of them right now  but just reading through some comments has been helpful and has given me a confidence boost  ,0

i got fired today for not being communicative enough  im a just graduated   yo guy with a really mild form of aspergers  i work ed  at an online marketing agency for about a year now  with daily contracts  i did my internship there in february last year and they hired me on the spot  the boss and my colleagues always praised me for my copywriting skills and for being able to learn new things this fast  however  i recently made a huge mistake while dividing budgets on a social media campaign  first time doing that  of course  that s not okay     yesterday my boss called me into his office  out of the blue  without an evaluation  to say that we wont continue working together  according to him  i knew perfectly what i was doing  and was doing it good too   but he always saw me as too quiet  i wasnt transparent and communicative enough to him about my work what i was doing at every moment in time  i need too much structure and coaching  they need people who can manage things on their own and i didn t fit that profile  i asked if there was something else i did wrong  but that wasn t the case  except for the budgetting  it was merely the communicative aspect  my skills and knowledge were perfectly fine  its basically saying my personality isnt suited for the industry  thats a low blow  and its really hard to process     but  as of today  im deciding to be better  if i find a new workplace  im hoping they give me time and coaching  i dont know how i can work on being more open  but ill try  and i hope  after a few years  i can say   boss  if youll ever meet me again  i hope youll be sorry for letting me go      note  this post might not give that impression but i still have lots of respect for him and for the opportunities he gave me  i m not looking to sue because he s an amazing person  even though he fired me   i made a big mistake  i didnt ask enough questions or keep him updating on issues or my current work  that was  the last straw   that s that  it s just sad that my career at that place ended so abruptly  i m going to work on my communication and be better    edit  paragraphs  ,0
would approaching a girl this way be weird  so theres a girl in my class thats kind of shy and i think shes super cute   i want to talk to her but she kinda keeps her head down and l never really see the opportunity to   would it be weird if i caught up to her after she leaves class and just said  hows it going      it feels almost predatory to me for some reason  like an ambush  i dont plan on straight up asking her out  just making friendly conversation at first   i dont think i have the courage to move seats this far in the semester just to talk to her and with my whole class in earshot  im not that confident   edit  thanks to all the advice  sorry if i dont respond to you  ,0
when someone is talking about themselves  ask open ended follow up questions instead of talking about yourself and how you had a similar experience people love to talk about themselves  if there telling you about themselves or stuff they like  ask questions that require more than a yes or a no and are to do with what she is talking about  a lot of people start talking about an experience they had similar to what the person was saying and it s not preferable  this should be applied to anyone your talking to not just your crush or close fiends or gf bf  ,0
how can i get over the worry of potentially being single forever  hi there  for a while now i occasionally get this overwhelming feeling of loneliness hit me and it has gotten me quite low at times  im a    year old male  my friend circle is very small and i rarely go out with friends outside of my college hours  this is because they say they are busy a lot of the time  lots of people who i do know have partners and seem really happy together and its not that im not happy for them its just it kind of hurts realising nobody has seen anything in me or really seems to care it feels like  i have tried online dating but that in itself has been unsuccessfu l i have managed to have a couple of dates with one girl earlier this year which unfortunately didnt go as i had hoped  i sometimes think to myself i understand that nothing is a god given right or a certainty but a life single forever with no companionship and living alone is a life i do not want  i just want to be happy  i find music helps me feel better and playing the guitar  ,0

my height is becoming a crippling insecurity  advice  hello  i am an    year old male who is        i used to not care about my height at all  i would get jokes as a kid but i assumed everyone gets made fun of for something so i brushed it off  it was literally never a problem   however  it changed drastically when i started realizing how grossly unattractive i am to the majority of females  edit  women  didn t realize it was weird to say  females  oops   i started getting rejected solely for my height and it just caused this vicious cycle where i got rejected for my height  felt insecure about it  then got rejected for my height   my insecurity about it  and so on  i kept hearing things like  i d date you if you were taller  or  op would be so cute if only he wasn t short    people say  if she doesn t like you for your height you dodged a bullet  but i feel like that s such a feel good argument  the majority of women doesn t like short guys  could you really convince a tall guy with a girlfriend that he was hit by a  bullet    you can probably sense much of my insecurity through this post  i can see that it s becoming a huge problem  and i don t know what to do about it  sometimes i feel like there s no point in trying to compensate in other ways if so many women will disregard my positive traits because of something i can t control    but logically i know there has to be a way i can find peace with myself  if people with way worse life conditions can be secure  why can t i  ,0

i have no friends  lonely all the time    year old guy  good looking  great job  musician  etc  i am a nice guy and have lots of interests  but i always find it so difficult to make  keep friends  i had a bunch of friends in high school  but most of them moved away  got married  and simply got busy with their own lives  ever since ive been left to meet new people  and while i have  i cant seem to break past the  acquaintance  line with anyone  im quiet and shy  but i also just feel so much anxiety when im in a group of people  i feel like i know im not going to make any friends or good conversations so i just shut down  i cant control any of that    i can manage one on one conversations pretty well  especially with women  but the second it becomes a group setting  i am almost too slow to contribute anything interesting or funny to the group and normally just end up taking a back seat  it is super frustrating because this obviously impedes my chances of finding a girlfriend too  im literally always doing things on my own and can never share my time or feelings with anyone else  i just feel like i have a hard time conversing with people normally  it seems harder for me than it is for others   some might say go find a hobby  well i have lots and its the same deal  going out doesnt help because i shut down again  i talk to people at work but my job is so far away i can never hang out with them  plus they are all in their   s and   s with a family and other friends    i just feel lonely all the time and i worry this will extend into my   s and   s and i will eventually die alone  what is the point of having everything figured out if i cant share any of it with anyone  i dont need a million friends  i just find it so hard to make  keep friends due to my quiet nature  is there any hope for me  ,0
  steps to be less boring    before going to a social event develop the habit of visualizing the entire social event  meeting  date in your head going well  run a small movie about the event in your head  see yourself laughing  others laughing  hear what you hear  and notice how you feel  imagine everything going extremely well and that people around you are having fun and taking special interest in you and in what youre saying       be a good listener  if you mastered this one skill people will see you as a very interesting person and someone fun to be with  all you need to do is pay attention to what people are saying and stop thinking about how you are being perceived  by making the story in your head about them  not you  you are going to notice how your level of anxiety has dropped down greatly or even disappeared  this is simple  you are no longer trying to impress them with stories about yourself or your personal interests  you are simply letting them tell you whats interesting for them and as long as people are talking about themselves theyll never get bored       if you find it difficult to show genuine interest in other peoples stories or personal interests you dont share with them then theres a tiny yet effective trick to use here which would shift your thinking about peoples stories  believe that in every story you hear there is an important lesson to help you with your life or information about the other persons inner world  this will help you take special interests in other peoples stories because there now something in it for you  i am not talking about faking it  trust me  when you change your mindset youll discover how every every story has valuable lessons for you to learn no matter how seemingly boring it sounded  also  every story gives you a peak into someone elses inner world  things they probably wont say directly to you or they yet havent learned about themselves       wait for the question  since youve given others the opportunity to talk about themselves and you were actively listening to them they now like you  without them telling you this but everyone loves a good listener  now theyll start asking you questions about yourself  this is one of the signs you suddenly became an interesting person to them and so they wanna learn more about you  use the questions they asked as a chance to present yourself to them in a way thats interesting to them  how  do not just keep talking nonstop until their interest in you drops  in the beginning give simple answers and wait for the next question  if they are still asking you about the same subject then chances are they wanna learn more because they find it interesting  if they asked you a different question then again answer moderately  give information but do not bombard them with it  they stayed on topic and kept digging deeper  good  keep that subject and give more information now that you know they are interested      memorize some of the words they used in their stories and self expression and occasionally repeat those words to them while commenting on their stories  sharing your own stories  or while asking them questions  for example  ella said   my last trip to africa was so much fun  we actually had a blast  the number of activities one can do there is insane  it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life   for example  you go   wow that does sound insane  i didnt know a trip to africa could be so rewarding and fun    trust me  ella will think you are one of the most interesting people she has ever met  just dont make it sound like you are doing it on purpose or with each sentence she makes because she might think you are just mocking her or lack individuality and creativity  you can also do it while sharing stuff about yourself later on after the conversation had drifted into another direction  example     right after my daily workout i feel so rewarded  its insane how simple adjustments can influence our moods       the art of questioning  this is a general note and a very useful skill to be applied at any point whether in your social life  with your partner  with your customers clients at work  or even with your kids  always avoid asking close ended questions such as    did you enjoy your trip    do you like your job     since you told me you are studying psychology  do you like it so far     do you believe in love     is this game addictive to you    close ended questions are those that usually can be answered with a simple yes or no or any variation of that to confirm or negate something  i am  very much  pretty sure  i dont think so  not sure  probably  i would say so      and so on    it is understandable that close ended questions are needed and important but not when you want to get people to talk  those of you who work in sales  business development  or marketing know exactly what im talking about  you dont want your customers to give you a yes or no answers but rather you want valuable information  opinions  suggestions  feedback     you want to learn more about their needs  expectations  and challenges  this is where open ended questions come into play  here are the same questions i posted above only asked differently this time    trip  tell me about your last trip to the middle east  im interested to hear your stories   job  how does a typical day at work look like for you    study  what made you choose psychology    love  how can you tell when you or someone else is in love    or if love had a recipe what do you think the main ingredients would be and why     game  what would you change about this game or features you add to make it addictive    these are just examples but you can clearly see how one is compelled to talk when asked open ended questions  if you are a parent  always ask your kids this type of questions  it will intrigue their thinking and help them become better communicators and ultimately affect their social life  tell me about your day at school  what do you like the most about your friend eric  teach me something new you have learned today  how did that make you feel  such questions will improve your childs social intelligence and their ability to form healthy relationships              this is not written by me  i found it buried in a youtube comments section and had to share  ,0

why does everyone look at you    the spotlight effect hi guys     x   b   some time ago i made a movie about  the spotlight effect  and why we always feel like people are staring at us  i thought it would be useful for some of you guys  so heres a short summary  for those who prefer to watch the movie    why are people staring at you   the spotlight effect  https   youtu be etk  arscd     mods  feel free to remove the link if this is considered spam    the spotlight effect was first named in      by thomas gilovich  and kenneth savitsky  its defined as  a tendency of people to overestimate the extent to which others notice aspects of ones appearance or behavior and the extent to which they are aware of it    this effect is an extension of two other cognitive phenomena  the first one is the false consensus effect  this bias states that  in general  people overestimate the extent to which other people share their opinion  we are social beings and we always try to fit in with the group  because we want to be normal  we like to think that other people share our opinion  and thats why we create an imaginary consensus of what is normal in our mind so that  in most cases  we can feel better about ourselves  but if we feel somewhat insecure about ourselves  for example  because of a stain on our shirt  we assume that other people will think its weird or disgusting as well  even though they probably dont notice   the second effect is the  anchoring and adjustment effect   this effect states that people will change their judgement based on the initial information that they get as they dont have a frame of reference  for example  im a car salesman and i tell you that a car is worth          now  you dont know a lot about cars but you do know that im a cheeky salesman  so you dont agree with me  instead  you offer me a solid       to negotiate  now  lets say i offered you the same car for        in this case  there would be a big chance that you still wouldnt agree with me and that you would offer       as you have no clue what a car is worth  in the same way  we are more likely to set their own insecurities as a baseline for what others will think of them   the spotlight effect is an egocentric phenomenon  we focus on one aspect of ourselves and therefore we assume that others will do the same   let me give you the example of probably the weirdest thing ive ever done  one of my best friends is a dj  a few months ago  me and some other friends decided that it would be funny to throw some bras at him while he was playing as you would see with the really famous djs and rockstars  so i went to the cheapest clothing store in town to get some bras  you have to know that this store is quite a big store with plenty of visitors  i walked in  looked around to find the cheapest bras that i could find  i walked back through the entire store  stood in line for the cash register for a few minutes and not a single person gave me a weird look or a stare  moreover  no one even noticed that i  a tall    year old guy  was walking around with bras  no one even bothered to look at me  and the lady at the cash register  she didnt give me a strange look either      people really dont care as much as you would expect  i hope this video can help you to feel better  feel free to share your opinion       x   b   willem    x   b   references    epley  n     gilovich  t          the anchoring and adjustment heuristic  why the adjustments are insufficient  psychological science                   gilovich  t     savitsky  k          the spotlight effect and the illusion of transparency  egocentric assessments of how we are seen by others  current directions in psychological science                  gordon  a  m          have you fallen prey to the  spotlight effect    retrieved from  https   www psychologytoday com us blog between you and me        have you fallen prey the spotlight effect  https   www psychologytoday com us blog between you and me        have you fallen prey the spotlight effect   mendoza denton  r          the spotlight effect  psychology today  retrieved from  https   www psychologytoday com us blog are we born racist        the spotlight effect  https   www psychologytoday com us blog are we born racist        the spotlight effect   ross  l   greene  d     house  p          the  false consensus effect   an egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes  journal of experimental social psychology                  ,0
  m is it fake to act different around different people  ive done this for years  but im not sure if this is a problem or not   depending on who im with  ill act different  this is usually the case because i have kind of a weird personality  theres certain jokes  lingo that some people wont get or understand so i dont say them around them    keep in mind though that everything i say and do is my personality but it comes out depending on who im with  im not making up a personality    essentially  i could hangout with one person and i could bring a friend along and theyll see a whole different side of me  is that a problem  is that being fake  how do i fix this   ,0
don t demonstrate to people how much you know  ask them what they think  instead   edit  honored to be front page worthy  i think the best way to achieve the goal above is to actually try to discover why its interesting for you to learn about other people and what kinds of questions get at the most interesting part of a person  for you  as counter intuitive as this may sound  i think that social anxiety can be diminished tremendously and interpersonal relationships strengthened by taking what interests you to develop questions that help you learn whether the other person has shared interests or insight  this is a developed skill  i think  learning to bite your tongue when you want to jump in and give your opinion and instead using questions to effectively do the same thing is the goal ive set for myself in engaging with others  if youre having to work hard with someone and if your questions arent hitting the mark  you can either revise the questions you ask or at some point decide that this person may not be a good fit as a significant other  close friend  acquaintance  fb friend or whatever  depending on what you find out or how deep someone is willing to go with you  ,0

i m terrible at fostering relationships i don t know if it s because i personally can get so anxious about coming off as annoying  or trying to hang out too soon with people and crossing a boundary  but i m just so afraid of reaching out to people  i have friends i just know a lot of my relationships aren t as strong because i don t reach out the way that i should  it really sucks because i genuinely have so much love for so many people and there are relationships that i d like to have in the future  but i just don t know how to do it   i m great at engaging with people when i m in person  but the time inbetween is usually radio silent on my end because i don t want to be clingy  or annoying  ugh   does anyone else have this kind of issue  have you gotten better  what s helped you  ,0

cheatsheet  the ultimate guide to small talk with cashiers   servers   barstaff etc     words  well well well   if it isnt the annoying guy from  that other post   https   amp reddit com r socialskills comments eunupt cheatsheet ultimate guide to better small talk in   back again talking shit   after my last post  i certainly had a mixed responses  ranging from  people messaging me for more details  to having conversations with people on the phone to go over other things and techniques to people messaging me that im full of shit and know nothing  oh well cant win them all   so im back in the same place where i had lunch and wrote the last post  but thats not what prompted me to give this another whack  no  instead it was the somewhat looking grumpy woman who was serving me and i selected as my target  as in this bitch is getting talked to one way or another before i leave   we ended up having a very pleasant conversation and turns out i was completely wrong about her  and she gave me a free coffee  who knew being friendly could have such perks  but it was the way in which went about talking to her that got me thinking   its the same approach ive been doing the whole time  which ive gracefully called  the   pronged approach extraveganza    anyway before we get into this   pronged approach for lack of a better term  just want to set some context  as re reading through all the comments of the previous post  yes i read them all  no i dont have a life   there seems to be a point that keeps recurring    so i want you all to say it with me     you cant talk to someone who doesnt want to be talked to     sometimes people have shit days  sometimes for lack of a better term  theyre just cunty  other times they might of gotten a bollocking off a manager for being too much of a stud at the staff party  and are a bit quiet   its okay for people to not want to talk to you  the issue is its   not okay   for you not to try talk to them  i might over a bit more of this in another post   but i just thought would get that very clear from the offset   so  its lunchtime  you head down to the local cafe or some shit   i have no clue  and open the door  its a bank holiday  and youre the only one there  the only person working turns around to look at you  youve frozen  is that sweat  you walk up the counter  heart rate steadily increasing  you order  they punch it in the machine and you hand over cash  and then you wait  theyre looking right at you  has time stopped  surely its too late to break the silence at this stage  they look like theyre tired anyway  dont want to annoy them  what is taking them so long     and on and on you go in your head the whole time you are there   people are social creatures  and from working in bar for   years during university  on a quiet day where youre hungover and are contemplating becoming an astronaut so you dont have to be there  if someone comes in and throws you a lifeline of a few minute conversation   you grab it with both hands  for the most part    im rambling a bit here  but lets tie it all together   the   pronged approach   upon entering   approaching till or bar   basically whenever the first interaction happens  was shocked at how particular people were in the last post in relation to specific scenarios  this isnt a science dammit   its all about breaking the ice   showing you are on the social side of things  my go to which works very well is         greeting    how are you    in this sense greeting can be anything  hey  hi there  good morning etc etc   this gets the ball rolling and from a social lubrication  fucking love this term  view of things  is the equivalent of a jab   gets the party started and if done correctly can catch them off guard  fights have been won with jabs   this is the first test  bare in mind again that not everyone wants to talk  but this can catch some people off so dont give up hope just yet young padawan   its called the   pronged for a reason  usually youll just get a  good  response and thats fine   were just warming them up   onto the second       busy today      can be used in either a sarcastic or non sarcastic manner  this is the straight right to the temple  if you catch them with this properly its game on  it can be the key to opening the flood gates to a conversation   however as mentioned previously sometimes it can be an immeasurable amount of water  or on occasion not even enough to fill an egg cup   after this you can engage in a few minutes of small talk or just cut straight to the actual ordering part    and again my friends  thats all to it  again nothing too complex to it or fancy  extremely basic straightforward questions that can be asked to anyone to break that initial interaction with staff in a place  the one thing that can make a big difference however is ask solely from an interest side of things and dont expect anything to come from it   sure using this it has ended up in me getting dates from cute cashiers etc  but that is never my intention   ill approach an older man with the same enthusiasm as an         this is the door opener  but its all i can bring you  you need to find your own style of talking   banter   where your personality fits in generally in conversations and adapt and take it from there    its weird at first  not to mention forced   and horribly awkward for a few instances  i wont lie to you  the first few times you get a one word response can be a bit soul destroying for lack of a better word  as youve done everything as guided to

how do i rebuild my social life after living   years abroad and drifting apart from old friends  after graduating from high school in      i moved from the uk to colombia and only kept in contact with my closest friends throughout the first couple of years  however  i have gradually drifted apart from even those people due to the distance and also my insecurities telling me that  they have forgotten about me so whats the point    i returned to the uk in december      and have met up with some of my closest friends which found out i was returning and really wanted to see me again but i have not heard much back from them since  should i be taking more initiative to talk to them and make plans with them to continue the friendship or were those meet ups just a one time thing and should i not try to rebuild those friendships  ,0
does anyone else have moments when you are talking  and you notice no one is paying attention  so you don t know whether to stop or finish the thought  i seem to have this problem often  usually when i think something is funny  sometimes  i ll be on a roll with people because they re laughing back  but then i feel like i ll try too hard to get their attention and it leads to awkward moments for me   does anyone else struggle with this  also  does anyone have any tips on how to speak only when necessary  and by that  i mean speaking only when you have something meaningful to say  not just to occupy silence   edit  i didn t think this would blow up  nor did i think it would be a problem a lot of people have  thanks for all the advice everyone  and feel free to contribute still  ,0

im quiet cause theres literally nothing on my mind sometimes    people get frustrated at me for being quiet and not saying much  sometimes i just react with an  ohhh  to what people are saying because theres literally nothing on my mind or theres nothing i can say  its not because im not paying attention or because im not interested but because i am actually out of words  how do people deal with this  how are folks able to say stuff when it seems like theres nothing to say   ive also done some recreational drugs in the past and generally felt like i was able to say and offer a lot more  why is there nothing to say in real life though  my mind is so passive ,0
i know why i ve had so many toxic friendships in the past i ve noticed a dynamic that has occurred over and over again in my life  i make a friend  and that person begins to treat me badly  they might insult me  gossip about me  and other things  i would not stick up for myself  i felt i  couldn t   i had no boundaries  they will act like this some of the time  and other times  they would be nice so i would feel i couldn t end the friendship  because i loved it when they were nice  it was very unpredictable  i have had at least four  friends  which involved this dynamic  and those friendships felt the most exciting    all the while  i would bitch about that person to other people  and all the bad things they were saying doing  while seeing myself as the victim  it felt good in a way  to see myself as a poor  unfortunate victim and to get sympathy  i also tended to complain a lot about other things  i would feel a bit bored by friends who consistently treated me well  and seemed to insert  drama  into the relationship  so in a way  i was also the toxic one  since i was bitching about the bad friends but staying in the friendship     how i m fixing it    since i ve become conscious of this  it has helped  i m better at recognising and ending toxic friendships  and i ve had healthier friendships  i m getting better at speaking up for myself  i ve realised that i deserve to be treated well  and that i don t need to be friends with everyone  i also try to refrain from rehashing bad ways i ve been treated by people in the past  as that tends to feed the feeling of victimisation that i have enjoyed  i try to remember positive things and people  i distance myself from people who make me feel bad victimised    as a kid  my parental relationships were similar to the traits i see in those friends   quick changes between criticism and niceness  and me feeling guilty if i stood up for myself  as well as ashamed and victimised  so perhaps this is the reason why i was drawn to those people  they are familiar   can anyone relate to this dynamic  or have unhealthy dynamics to share that they have had  ,0
i can t form new connections and i m so incredibly lonely  i really don t know if this belongs in here  but if you think not  let me know   here s the thing  i don t have much to complain  i have family  i have a couple of best friends  a handful of friends and many acquaintances  i ve had a decent love life so far   still  everyday  i feel like i m almost completely alone in the world  i ve had general anxiety for most of my life  it being really bad in my teens but improving considerably as i left that phase  i ve constantly  since i was a kid  been part of groups where i felt like some kind of outcast  even when i wasn t the only one  within them  and that s still the case  even in college  i ve also been repeatedly let down by having very close long term friendships with people who later turned out not to be my real friends  maybe for that reason i have a lot of trouble making connections with people around me  no matter how hard i try  and it is making me miserable   i m a reserved person  and i don t know how to make the first move  meaning  i don t remember what making friends is like  because most of mine are from when i was a kid  excluding one or another recent ones who i was actually approached by   every single one of my hookups or relationships happened because i was approached  never the other way around  i don t know how to take the initiative even when i want to  if i have a big crush on someone and they give me a lead i just don t follow it  i don t know what to do  and i let it die  unless they re blunt and obvious   as my routine puts me in a space where i do not relate to anyone  and i take little pleasure in what i m doing  i grow more bored  as the few friends i have move overseas or drift apart  i grow more lonely  as time passes since my last romantic affair  i grow more needy   i m a very reserved person  but i crave human connection very strongly  my loneliness has started to be an issue because i don t feel like moving forward  the only solid and consistent tie i have is probably with my mother  right now  and almost nothing else   i don t know what it is about me that makes me seem unapproachable or unreachable  i m tired of being deemed as cold and distant when i m just lonely   i don t know what to do to help myself at this point  ,0
how can i be less insecure and negative towards myself  a lot of times when im talking to someone i have thoughts about how im boring  they dont care what im saying  i sound stupid  etc  i have imposter syndrome but instead of just within a job its kind of everything  i just dont feel like an adult  i dont know what im doing  i moved to a new city this week and even though its exciting im constantly worried about failing  never making any friends  never finding a job    its hard being totally alone here  i get hurt by little things  it makes sense to feel a little vulnerable right now because im basically starting my life over in a new place  but as i get more comfortable in this city i want to gain confidence  ,0

i get called out for using big fancy words a lot  but i dont  i got this group of blokes i grew up with and i often get from them that i  use big words  and they arent all that fancy in the first place    like i used the word  pretentious  and i immediately got  the face  and teasing for trying to sound smart   that level      it happens all the time and usually the only other option in my langauge is to describe it with a sentence  like well be discussing games and ill mention amazement at how hi poly a character is    get shot down for using fancy word  hi poly   something we literally do not have another term for except the english term we imported into the language     i am not trying to sound smart  i am not using big words above the office employee level which  except for few task related words   is the same as blue collar wordings    the guys arent blue collar  its not an extended buddy trolling campaign  the words aint big or fancy     how the fuck do i deal with this and get through to their heads that the words are normal and that its not trying to be smart    whenever i try it gets waved away as making excuses for yet another attempt to sound smart  ,0
going to college again at     want to be more socially active this time  title says it all  i have aspergers  but very mildly and it generally affects my organizational and planning skills more than my social skills  i still have some social anxiety and can be kind of awkward and shy  but im more extroverted than your average aspie    the problem is  i wasnt always like this and it took a lot of work to get to where i am now  because of my extreme self isolation when i was a teenager  i missed out on a lot of the social development people get in high school and had to work it out on my own over the next few years  i made my first  real  friendships at     went to my first ever party at     had my first date at almost     still havent had a girlfriend  and so on    during my first spin at college  i still didnt really know what i was doing in the social scene and so my social life was pretty dead  i did build some more social skills during that time thanks to a more extroverted friend who has kind of drifted away now  but i was still catching up and so my social life was pretty stale    i finished my program a year ago and have been working since then  ive still been making progress with my social skills  but i only really have two friends right now and only one of them is available to hang out even semi regularly  the other is really busy and not good with answering texts   theyre great friends  and i wouldnt trade them for anything or anyone  but my social life is really stagnant right now    so im going back to college in september  this time i want to be more socially active  ive been using my spare time for the past few months to build myself up for that  mostly ive been planning and working on     building on more extroverted hobbies  ive been getting good at bowling in particular      going to bars just to sort of observe and get familiar with how people are supposed to act there  i obviously dont mean creepily sitting there and staring at people  i mean just putting myself out there and paying attention to what other people are doing      looking for clubs to join around campus  ive been trying to find  neutral  ones that will attract a variety of people since i dont really fit into any one particular subculture or niche  ive found a couple which look pretty promising   so i just wanted some feedback here  do i have a good plan  is there anything else i should do to increase my odds of social success this time  is there anything im doing thats a bad idea and i should drop  thanks for advice  ,0
   year old male virgin  feel like a loser  why do i care all of a sudden  i have always been rather introverted and rarely put myself in positions to meet the opposite sex  however  since i have been focusing on education and what career to pursue  i never felt the desire to pursue women  i also never really exited my comfort zone until after i graduated and i had no choice but to put myself in some uncomfortable situations  this has helped develop me as a person even more    not being in a relationship was never a concern  or being a virgin  but now  for the past month i actually care  i want a relationship and me being a late bloomer has now made me a bit more self conscious as a virgin  i get concerned that if i do meet a girl  she will be put off by my total lack of sexual experience     update  this blew up more than i thought it would  i appreciate you reading my short rant and sharing your thoughts  i am glad to see this post has sparked discussions with users in similar situations in the comments also  much thanks    ,0
take care of yourself mentally youve probably heard that exercising  working out  running will help build confidence and make you feel good  but its also important to work out your brain      x   b   by this  i mean study  learn  and practice something  especially if youre the type to overthink things  if you are that type  then its most likely because you have a strong mind  it needs to focus on something  if it has nothing to focus on  then itll focus on itself  in other words  you  and at some point  its going to fixate on your problems      x   b   it takes self discipline to work out  physically as well as mentally  but its so important  reading is a start  you can also study something  do you want to be able to read and understand science journals  then study biology   khanacademy com  https   khanacademy com  is a great place for that  i watch one biology video a day  its slow and i dont retain every single thing  but its a good work out  plus it compounds  so ill be able to follow along when i see something i learned in the past but forgot  recognition keeps the flow going      x   b   learn an instrument  a language  watch history docs and read about history  you dont have to become an expert on any of these things  you dont even have to become good  the whole point is just to focus your mind on something  confidence  passion and skills will be the added benefits  but just the productivity is the goal      x   b   keep your mind focused  in my opinion  its better than physically working out because the skills youll learn studying will be so much more applicable than being able to lift something heavy    but physical exercise is good too  of course  and once again  you dont need to put any pressure on yourself to learn or retain it  just focusing and keeping your mind focused on a healthy activity will help your concentration      x   b   the next step is taking care of yourself emotionally  being aware of and processing emotions   but im still working on that myself      x   b   this might be better off in another sub  but this is what helped me gain confidence and succeed in social situations  so im sharing it here   ,0
i recently learned this great tip for keeping conversations going with people  basically i struggle with making conversation and i saw a youtube video by charismaoncommand  good channel btw  that included the ford mnemonic   f   family o   occupation r   recreation  what they like to do d   dreams  what their passions are  everyone has lots to talk about for each of these things so you can usually take the back foot  plus  the better listener you are  the better youll come across  hope its at least helpful to one of you    ,0
i need advice after my  friends  ditched me im currently in the   th grade at my high school and ever since i started ive been bouncing around social groups so i never really had any best friends and    of my friends from my primary school go to the same high school as me  i find my social skills to be quite lacking  i never know what to talk in   on   conversations and when im in a group i find it hard to speak up and give my opinion when everyone else is talking   at the start of last year i decided to stick with a certain group  it went well i felt like i was talking to people more and my self esteem started to grow and i was feeling just over all more confident  after a while though i realised that these guys didnt really care about me  they wouldnt invite me when they were going out and i was getting kind of bullied to be honest  they would make jokes about me  call me gay and a retard and stuff like all year   boys do but it was getting to a point where it just wasnt funny anymore and i felt hurt by these comments   when the new school year began at the start of february  the people that i thought where my friends basically just ghosted me  they abandoned the group chat that i was in with them  they avoid me at school and moved to a different place than where they usually hang out so that i wouldnt follow them  none of them straight up said we dont want to be youre friend  but im pretty sure i got the hint of what was happening   now that i look back on it  they dropped so many hints that they didnt really like me and i have no idea why  i was quiet but i would still talk now and again and i wouldnt bother or annoy any of them  now during lunch i normally just go into the bathroom eat my food and go on my phone until the bell rings  im starting to feel really lonely and im thinking thoughts that i really shouldnt be thinking  i feel to anxious to go to another groups and try and join them and i feel if i go to a different school the same thing will just happen to me  im to embarrassed to talk to my parents i feel like they would just judge me or send me to a therapist because they think im severely depressed   thank you for reading this  i would really appreciate some advice   edit  thank you to everyone for responding  i didnt really expect so many people to care about me i am truly thankful that so many people want to help me get out of my shell and get out there   edit  again   i woke up to this post having     more upvotes and like     more comments than it did when i went to sleep  once again i seriously cant thank you all enough  i dont really have the time to respond to every comment with a thank you  so please just believe that i read through every comment and i greatly appreciate that so many people care this much about me and want me to succeed  ,0
im pretty good at deep conversations but absolutely suck when it comes to fun casual conversations especially in a group setting this lets me have really good  funny  deep conversations with one or two people at the same time  one thing i notice is most people open up to me real quick and get comfortable even talking shit about people they usually hang out with   but put the same people in a group setting  they behave differently  they manage to have fun  light hearted conversation and i cant seem to get a word in except for a quip here and there or just smiling or laughing with them   i dont know if this is anti social behaviour  i know im likable  usually people have a good opinion of me but its hard to make a group of friends  even if i connect with someone personally on a deeper level and they invite me out with their clique of friends  i just dont click with them which can seem like im not fun to hangout    anyone relate  anythrough these barriers ,0
  st birthday  going to club alone because fuck it  why not  how do i not have a miserable time tonight  im extremely socially awkward  and clubs really arent my scene   playing minecraft and listening to podcasts is more my crazy night of choice  but its my   st birthday  so im going to go to a club and get the vibe  just to say that i did  i feel like id be missing something if i go all through college without going to the very vibrant city for nightlife   miles away from me  im very nervous and have no idea what its going to be like  or what could happen  what steps can i take to make sure that this doesnt suck as much as i think it will  ,0
watching other people interact makes me feel like im autistic watching other people interact with one another makes me feel autistic  because everybody else just seems so different from me  other people are able to laugh whole heartedly at minor anecdotes  other people are able to gain smiles and affection from other people from only speaking a few sentences  other people are able to achieve commonality with one another in a short time and speak to one another in a type of language as if theyve known each other forever in a timespan of five minutes  at my college  ive noticed that just about everyone i see is able to gain friendships from only seemingly short and small social interactions   i cant do any of that  i cant laugh naturally at small anecdotes  i cant  bond  with people after a couple sentences  i cant speak to someone as if ive known them forever and not get a reaction from them that looks like they want to punch me in the face  nobody smiles at me  and nobody shows any type of interest in wanting to get to know me  even when i smile  nobody smiles back  i just feel like i cant get along properly with other people no matter how welcoming or friendly i try to act   i just feel like im autistic  i feel like everyone else thinks theres something wrong with me  or theres something weird about me  and nobody wants to associate with me  and then i observe everyone else  people who are able to gain friendships  smiles  and laughter from such small and unimportant social interactions  and i cant help but think that theres something wrong with me internally  it seems like everyone hates me  and i just cant figure out why  im not trying to mess around with anyone or trying to fuck anyones day up  but fucking nobody likes me and nobody wants to associate with me  and i just feel like im autistic because of it   i dunno  i have thought about seeing a specialist and getting evaluated for autism or aspergers  but im more scared than anything finding out that i actually have aspergers at    years old  it would change my life entirely and i just wouldnt know how to handle it     x   b     x   b     x   b     x   b     x   b     x   b  ,0
sitting next to an extrovert at grad    so i graduated from high school last spring  and the for the ceremony the school had all the students lined up in alphabetical order  so i was next to this kid because of our names  well call him h   h was a very popular kid at school  hes really nice as well  and ive known him for long before high school  he is very outgoing  and pretty much everyone knew him by the end of high school  he learns names incredibly fast  and will talk to anyone  just an all around great kid   i  on the other hand  am obviously a lot different  im pretty shy and scared of people  so i only talked to a small friend group throughout high school  i dont say much   so this ceremony lasted a few hours  and the whole time i was either lined up next to h or sitting beside him  what i observed was incredibly interesting and helpful  the number of times he interacted with other students in the line was phenomenal  he was constantly calling to people and trying to make jokes and stuff  without being right beside him the entire time  you would not realize just how many times he was saying things to people   but heres the most interesting part    a good number of his interactions were awkward and didnt really go well    people might ignore him or not hear him  his joke might not get a laugh from anybody  but those moments did not faze him  and he just kept going and forgot about them   im someone who has an irrational fear of those very moments   what if they ignore me    what if they dont like me    i tend to jump to conclusions after that happens  and it causes me to fear speaking up  i think people who ignore me dont like me  maybe i said something wrong   but the truth jumped out to me as i observed that h was experiencing the same things that i thought he couldnt  cause hes sociable and all that  i realized that one of the most important parts of trying to become more sociable is to not be so caught up about these moments  because in truth  they dont matter  and its worth having some awkward moments to be able to make lots of friends  and get to know people better  everyone experiences these things  and its all about how much you worry about them  because they are really not so bad  ,0
would anyone be interested in daily or weekly socialskills challenges  this is something that personalfinance does that i use regularly  and i m a bit surprised that more self help subs haven t started doing the same  is this something people would be interested in  i ll also admit that i would rather not be the one to do it and was hoping if this post got enough support we could convince the mods to run it   ,0
 rant  asking people why theyre so quiet or why so serious  please dont do this  its incredibly rude and distressing to people who are self conscious of their introversion and or awkwardness  its kinda okay if you do this with a very close friend but never loudly to make him her self conscious  this should be common sense but apparently not    also i do not understand how people can tell im serious or depressed just by looking at me and without even interacting with me   ,0
i m at a point in my life where i feel the loneliest that i ve ever felt  i m only    years old and every weekend or break is the same for me  staying home by myself watching youtube or  playing video games  i have friends that i talk to at school and i always have lots of fun when i m with them at school  but then once school ends i usually don t get a single message from any of them asking what i m doing over the weekend or just how i m doing  and we never hang outside of school  all of my siblings always have plans with their friends on the weekends even my younger sibling who is only    years old  this makes me feel like such a loser and a loner and i feel so embarrassed that even my younger brother hangs out with friends over the weekends  this leads to me being by myself at home doing literally anything to keep myself entertained  i m not bad at socializing but i get really anxious when it comes to certain social situations such as starting a conversation or inviting others out  which is why i never invite friends to hang out  and i feel like this is why they aren t inviting me to hang out on weekends or outside of school  i ve just been feeling so lonely lately and i think i m starting to become depressed  i just wish my friends could start inviting me to hang out over the weekends it would make me so much happier  i feel like it s my fault too though for not  asking if they want to hang out  i m just so bad at making plans   and social anxiety doesn t really help either  any help from you guys would be greatly appreciated thank you     edit  thank you for everyone who has given me advice on my situation  i really appreciate it  and i m glad i m not the only one who feels or has felt like this  thanks for all the support   ,0
rejection sucks but it s worth it in the end  hear me out  i ve spent most of my life actively not making plans with people or reaching out because i m afraid of rejection  i feel like i can only remember the few negative social interactions i ve had and let those control me and never remember the positive ones   i ll wake up in the morning  see a post on facebook that an old friend moved to the town next to me  and think   oh  i should message them to hang out  but then the evil part of my brain says   no  loser  no one wants to hang out with you   i ve been trying to fight that and ignore it and just message them to see what they say  and sometimes i do get rejected  there s no cure for rejection  but i m trying my best and that makes all the difference   ,0
friend    f  calls me  basic  for simply wanting to be comfortable as myself idek why im making this post  its so self explanatory and the answer is obvious  i guess i just want some validation for my solution  to cut her out of my life or just finally explain it all face to face  recently she has been calling me  basic  for the dumbest reasons such as   wearing a pair of shoes  i finally got a new pair of shoes  my only good pair of shoes  and they make me feel like less of a slob when i go out  i finally  just feel comfortable and presentable in my clothes   going to hang out with friends in popular spots  i finally got some friends and they want to actually hang out with me a  but they live ages away so it makes sense to meet up halfway  a spot that just happens to be very popular as well   sending snapchats with half my face in the screen  so  i hate my face  i think i look like a fucking troll and i dont want to see that shit looking back at me any time   i just  i just want someone to tell me if what im feeling is reasonable    ,0
i got involved in something and met loads of people the science society at my university was having a board game night and i decided to go  i got there and saw a big group of people from my course that i sort of know and sat beside them  i was so uncomfortable  but thankfully they let me play and a couple of us went to the student bar after  where i might have been hit on by two of the girls  the whole thing was very scary  but really worth it  ,0
an important skill nobody is talking about  edit  i now write a weekly newsletter dedicated to helping you achieve social   dating success  you can join that here   https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine   https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine         so last week we talked about  a habit you probably have and you probably want to get rid of  https   www reddit com user snapsocialguru comments  ktfd  socialite magazine  st jmxkibr  sh b   b         today i want to talk about something i ve never heard anyone else talk about when it comes to social skills    and when you master this  it ll take time  so be easy on yourself   you ll have no problem being the center of the spotlight  trust me  it s fun  especially in one on one conversations   this is a skill i learned in may       i was laid off from my first job after college and had tons of time to kill  so i did what any logical introvert would do     i joined an improv class  lol    in improv class  one of the skills they teach you is how to banter and be more fluid with your conversations   okay  let s go back in time even more   flashback to     ish   when i was    years old  i picked up dale carnegie s  how to win friends and influence people     it was and still is an important book for me  in fact  my notebook where i put all my notes is likely still stashed away somewhere in my parent s house    one of the main takeaways from the book was   you ve got to be a good listener     be a good listener and you ll be well liked  be a good listener and you re golden    ha  yes  that s true  but only partly true  it s great advice and in fact i m likely going to write a post on how to deeply listen because it s something potentially life changing once you master it      in my last post  link above  i mentioned the power of meditation  and one thing meditation teaches you how to do is zone in on a person and block all other distractions around you  terrific for listening skills     but another skill to develop is actually the opposite of listening and nobody talks about it       the skill i am referring to is the ability to ramble     part of being a terrific conversationalist is the ability to ramble without overdoing it    people are more shy than you think and will rely on you to lead the conversation until they feel more comfortable chiming in    many conversations will die out until you learn this ability   unfortunately  what people do when they don t have this skill is they enter into  interview mode     interview mode  is only good when you re genuinely curious about the other person or when you ve just met someone  but if you re using it as a crutch to keep a conversation going  it can be a painful experience for the other person    thus enters the skill of rambling    learn how to ramble a little  when you know how to be expressive  you sub communicate confidence    i ve found that one of the great ways to develop this skill is by filtering  less    the less you filter what comes out of your mouth  the better conversationalist you become    quit worrying about what you ll say being uncool or sounding weird  you might at first  but over time you develop sharper conversation skills thanks to social feedback   quick  kinda embarrassing example     last week i went on a date and the girl decided she no longer wanted to see me after i made a set of bad jokes  i quickly realized my mistake  took it as social feedback  and have slightly shifted my humor in a way that ll be better received    point is  this is only something you can do if you stop filtering yourself so much  social feedback will become your best friend in this process   over time  you ll have the ability to talk to anybody on any given subject  you ll be able to riff off seemingly randomly topics  you ll be able to have longer conversations  and surprise    you might even develop new friendships      tl dr  stop filtering  learn the artful skill of rambling  without overdoing  and your ability to hold conversations with people will improve      laz ,0

i    f  am reaching out for the first time  i m ridiculously excited  i contacted a few fellow students to start a study group  i ve spent the last decade and a half talking myself out of trying to start conversations with friend crushes    they look busy   they look too cool to want to talk to me   i don t have anything to talk about   etc   even if we don t turn out to be the best of friends  this ll be a chance for connection and honestly that s everything i can hope for   ignore the part of your brain that predicts rejection even if it s only long enough to deliver that invitation  initiate that conversation  or send that email text  you re not half as undesirable as you convince yourself you are  ,0

does anyone else do almost everything alone  i go out to eat by myself  i go to amusement parks by myself  i go to the beach by myself  hiking  shopping  road trips  you name it  i most likely go alone   not really because i want to   i would rather have someone with me    its much better to share experiences with someone you care about but the truth is  i just got tired of people always letting me down   i got tired of everyone flaking out at the last minute and cancelling plans   i can understand if things came up  it happens   but if you knew you couldnt afford to go or just didnt want to period  just tell me upfront   dont wait until the last minute   or when you do go out with others  having to make so many compromises about what to do that its not fun anymore   and then you have those that dont even make an effort to have fun   after a while i just said the hell with it and started doing everything alone   i can do what i want  go where i want  stay as long as i want  eat where i want   but i really do miss having others to share experiences with  but ive given up on everyone  ,0
do you ever get the feeling someone is laughing at you  a random stranger youve never seen before  theres   of them  one of them mumbles something only loud enough for the other to hear and the other one roars in laughter  the first time it happened i brushed it off  but then it happened again a little while after  they stare at me while they laugh with their unnecessarily exaggerated laugh  its like  ha ha  im laughing at you but you dont know why  hahahaha   i cant think of what could be so damn funny  the first time i was pumping gas and the second time paying for groceries  just regular mundane tasks  next time im straight up gonna say  whats so funny  i wanna laugh too    does anyone else feel like random strangers laugh at them for an unknown reason  ,0
a tip for dealing with negative self image  hello everyone  ive read a few posts the last couple days from people who describe themselves in such a negative way  calling themselves lazy or awkward  this is for you  first this isnt a complete solution its just a start  ok now if you say i am so awkward  or i am so lazy  stop  stop right there and ask yourself  what is the thing i refer to as i  if you give me a thousand answers it always boils down to responses and actions from mental constructs you programed into yourself via experiences youve had  the real you is the awareness behind those programs  behind the ideas or beliefs you identify with and act on  step back think about how you can observe all of this  your awareness is not what you do or think but something beyond that  everyone is the same  some are more aware of that than others  but you are not awkward your actions are  the you  the real you is beyond all that  do not think bad things about yourself  you create mental constructs that reinforce a bad opinion of yourself  instead think  that action or that response was not a great response or action  then next time take a different path  but you  my friend  the real you  is neither good nor bad but a balanced observer watching and listening to your thoughts and the world and making choices on how to act  you are not your thoughts or feelings or actions  you are the awareness  ok have a great day   ,0
i m  m  almost    and i ve never been on a date  and i haven t had an in real life friend since about age     edit  sorry for the poor formatting  still kinda new to reddit    as the title says  i haven t had a friend in about a decade  i was homeschooled and it not only stalled my social development  but it was very difficult to find friends  the few that i did have either moved away  or drifted apart once i moved out of walking distance from them   i ve never been on a date  i ve told myself and others that the reason i m single is because i m not going out of my way to find someone  and that  it will happen when it happens   but deep down  i know that s not true  over the past   years i ve tried with setting up a date with quite a few girls  most of which that have showed interest in me  sometimes before i even show interest in them  but it always ends the same way  set up a time and day  only for them to cancel last minute  multiple times  before they either tell me they re not interested or ghost me  the other day i asked a girl that works with my mom if she has a snapchat  she quickly said   yes  do you want it   this girl in the past has always excitingly greeted me when i stop by  and talks to me when i do  i figured i d give it a try  i sent her a message last night and she replied immediately  which was nice  we exchanged a few messages but her responses quickly turned into two or three word answers  so i wrapped it up and said if she ever wants to hangout  message me  after her reply i could kinda tell she was just being nice at that point  which is okay  i appreciate the kindness  it s just a terrible feeling  and really i just wish i knew why i have so much trouble with these things  i don t have much confidence in my appearance  but i get told i m attractive quite often  i posted on r rateme and got  s and  s  i m told i have a good sense of humor and that i m  very sweet     so i just don t understand what it is that is wrong with me  or what it is i m doing wrong  i seem to converse very well with people that are older than me  but it just feels like people around my age never want to do anything with me  i so badly want to do things that people my age  and people below my age do and have done  i m so unhappy and lonely that a few days ago i quit my job that i ve been at for three years with nothing planned out with the hopes that a door opens up or something in my life changes   at this point  whenever i get turned down or ghosted  or someone bails on plans whether it be as a friend or potential date  i get put into this really bad depressive episode where i feel unbelievably empty  and typically cry when i go to bed  i don t know what i can do to improve at any of this  i worry that i m just really boring or something because i don t know how to change that  i m a very quiet person  and because i haven t had any friends for the last ten years i never do anything  so whenever i get put into a situation where i am around people my age  i don t really know what to do  and the older i get the more those chances slip away  which terrifies me  ,0
i m really scared of putting myself out there  to the point it effects everything there s been so many times i ve refrained from joining clubs  and if i have i left after the first day   even when i was very good at what it was  i kept thinking about  what if i get something wrong  i ve embarrassed myself  so i just avoid it completely  this has ruined a lot for me because i won t try new things  i m      a girl  and haven t even tried to get my first job because i m scared of interviews   it doesn t help that my cv is empty as well because i keep running away from anything i could ve put on there  since this lockdown started i ve been interested in sports again and i m going to be starting university in september  what i want to do is join a sports team but the fact i have no experience whatsoever is putting me off  no experience means people will watch me more  and judge when i do something wrong  the only thing motivating me are animes with inspiring characters      also everything i do i always get below what i actually want because i have no drive even though i really want it  no actions but good thoughts   i m that person who s really quiet until they get comfortable then they won t shut up  i just want to be like that all the time  not caring what people think  but people s judgemental looks glares just make me shut down so easily  visibly no one sees it  but all i do is avoid everything now and i hate it     i m so lost  i just want to be confident  ,0
today i turn     here are    lessons i ve learned about being better with people  focus on    dialing up energy     being curious  and    mind reading  for my birthday last month  i posted this   today i turn     here are    lessons i ve learned about being better with people  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments czah t today i turn    here are    lessons ive learned    r socialskills enjoyed it      i liked this so much ive already started to refer to this as  jeffs    laws of unspoken communications  in my head  lol      u roastedmarshmellow      this is the best thing i ve seen on reddit       u mercuriah    this deserves more gold than i will ever be able to afford     u whoahkay                                                 over the next few weeks  i m going to go in depth with each point  i ll include action steps to help you get better with people   our   for this week          dialing up your energy a bit        when you re being social makes it easier to have a good time          being curious will help you be interested in other people          no one can mind read  they have no clue what you re thinking  you have no idea what they are thinking                                    dialing up your energy a bit        when you re being social makes it easier to have a good time     people tend to mirror the energy level that you put out  if you re lower energy because you overslept  and you start talking to a coworker  they ll typically mirror your energy and enthusiasm   emotional contagion   if you ve ever started to talk to someone after getting some fantastic news  so you re higher energy   you ll notice that most times  they ride that high energy wave with you   if you re walking around at a      energy level all the time  your social interactions are just going to be a little flat   when we want to dial up that energy level to an       it can feel unnatural and fake   dont sweat it  commit to it   our goal isn t for       bouncing off the walls energy  we re just going for a  little  higher energy than normal     action step    here are some quick ways to dial up your energy   i do these before calls with clients  videos  and podcasts and social events       play upbeat music   jay z is my go to      sing the lyrics at a higher than normal volume      do    push ups      do several small jumps in place   it may look crazy from the outside   my neighbors might whisper about me as they walk their dogs  but it gets me out of my head  into my body and ready to be social   if you know what youll be talking about beforehand  a job interview  for example  heres a useful way to help you  dial in  to      energy      read or recite your talking points using zero energy      read or recite your talking points with       over the top energy like an infomercial host      when the time comes to present your talking points live  aim for somewhere in the middle                                        being curious will help you be interested in other people     i ve seen questions on this sub about  how can i be interested in other people    the simple answer  be curious   instead of using most of your processing power trying to  keep the conversation going  what if you tried focusing on learning one new thing about each person you talk to each day    this takes your focus from internal  what you re thinking and feeling  to external  i d better listen to this person so i can learn more about them   with social skills  external is better than internal   you might learn something mundane   this person likes green tea   or it could be interesting like  that person makes banjos out of old coffee cans  theyre called canjos      action step    your mission  should you choose to accept it  at the end of each day  write down one new thing youve learned about three people   when we work backwards from the end point of  being curious   what does that mean for the rest of the interaction    we  have  to listen   we  have  to be focused on the other person to listen   we ll probably be less focused on ourselves  because we ll be focused on the other person                                         no one can mind read  they have no clue what you re thinking  you have no idea what they are thinking     this is a mindset that really helped me as i was improving my social skills  repeat after me   i can t read other people s minds  other people can t read my mind   this is really powerful    if you ve ever been in a situation where you think you know what others are thinking about you  and you let those very real feeling hallucinations influence how you behave  then you ve experienced this first hand    here are some rapid fire examples where people can t read your mind     you walk into a new job  people can t read your mind     you enter a party  people can t read your mind    you sit down for a job interview  people can t read your mind   also    you walk into a new job  you can t read your new co worker s mind     you enter a party  you can t read the host s mind    you sit down for a job interview  you can t read your interviewer s mind   i think mind reading comes from people s discomfort with the unknown  we as humans want to know as much about any situation as we can    and with social situations  we re trying to fit in  or now screw up    so mind reading is a natural tactic to try to reduce that  information gap    what s the solution  control   only   what you can control  if you can t read minds  what else could you do     you walk into a new job  introduce yourself to as many new people as you can   keep in mind    and    from above     you enter a party  say hi to the host and ask them who you should meet at the party    you sit down for a job interview  since you can t mind read  the best you can do is answer and ask questions about the position  and make small talk with the interviewer  this also applies after the interaction  since mind reading is out    you can t think  oh  i bet my new co worker think i m weird     you can t think  i bet the host thought i was too quiet     you can t think  i bet the interviewer hated me   you can t think these things because you can t mind read     action step    if you catch yourself mind reading  gently remind yourself that you   can t   read minds  you can only control what you can control   body language  eye contact  conversation  etc                                      in the comments    which one of these have you struggled with  which one do you think you could take action on this next week      next week             the spotlight effect is real  we all tend to overestimate the amount that other people notice and observe us          it s possible to view the same event   different ways  ex  you say  hi   they brush past you instead of saying  hi   negative view   they must be mad at me   positive view   they must be preoccupied  they probably didn t hear me      this is one of my favorites             first impressions start before you open your mouth  seeming approachable is key                                 last thing     i get asked about having better group conversations a lot   i created this audio guide to join   enjoy group conversations you might check out  https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html   in the audio guide youll learn    how to jump into a conversation that has no opening   genuinely connect with anyone about any topic   how to get out of your head and stay present in group conversations    and more  word for word scripts  body language while joining a group  etc    enjoy   https   www becomemorecompelling com uggc audio html  ,0
my upbringing has left me so socially maladjusted that i dont know how i can even begin to fix myself  who would have thought that the coping strategies for a narcissistic household wouldnt transfer well to the real world  i dont know where to begin really  if youve ever heard of lost child syndrome then youll get a decent picture of what my childhood and teen years looked like  i spend an extraordinary amount of time alone  like i dont know how i did it  at some point i convinced myself i didnt need anybody and unfortunately this became a very real part of my character  i think that the    year old version of me planned on not having any freinds or contact with my family once i grew up  my family never let me go out with my freinds and moved me around schools constantly so i never learned how to make friends or be a friend  i learned how to hang out in the outside of freind groups but i was always a floater  because i had to spend all my time at home and my parents were endlessly emotionally volatile and critical of me i spent my time in my room drawing and playing videogames  thats how i spent highschool  i luckily woke up one day senior year and made some friends and had some life experiences  my luck unfortunate did not last into my first year of college as i became part of a very toxic freind group  i ended up distancing myself and being close with none of them  i felt excluded even though i didnt even like them towards the end  i realize now i have extreme complexes when dealing with people that i dont know how to sort through  i absolutely hate being the person someone needs and i hate needing others  i never open up  not even a little  im sure it turns people off and makes me seem untrustworthy  i really want close friends or a crew to roll with at all for that matter but i have a physiological reaction to what that actually entails  the thought of someone relying on me makes my stomach churn as does the thought of anyone actually knowing me  i hate how secretive i am but i dont know any other way  growing up hiding myself from the world was the only way to survive but obviously that isnt going to work anymore  i dont know what to do  with my social anxiety i am too afraid to reach out and because im not part of any friend group i have no one to reach out to me  my resilience to loneliness that i built up during childhood is failing and im at a loss as to what to do because right now the loneliness is crushing me  ,0
after       years at college i finally got invited to a party  aftwr lurking on the sub for the past   months i realized that i needed to stand up and be more social  im finally starting to make friends and i got invited to a party this weekend  its going to be weird in a party atmosphere since i havent been to one in years  so wish me luck  ,0
so  uh    is anyone who comments here actually socially skilled  or are we just a bunch of social retards giving each other advice on how to do things we arent any good at ourselves  quite frankly im not in a great position to tell others how to act in social situations because im shit at most of it myself   thats why im here in the first place  and i assume thats the case for a lot of other subscribers  thing is  somehow i doubt that people who are very socially capable and comfortable in their social self are keen to spend their free time on here bestowing their wisdom upon us  i have definitely seen some cringeworthy advice given here and there as well which absolutely wouldnt have gone down well   am i wrong  philanthropic social butterflies  please reveal yourselves  ,0
i ve become much more confident around girls  here s how i m a guy  almost     and i would say up until a few months ago i was quite awkward and nervous around girls  not that i couldn t talk to them or be friends  but when it came to pursuing one i was interested in  forget it  i had had a girlfriend  but it didn t work out at all  i used to wonder why   then i realized something and it changed my life  i wasn t being myself  i would try and put on a facade of sorts  think of lines ahead of time etc  i did this as i was afraid to come across as  weird  if i was myself   but i realized  how was i supposed to find girls who liked me for me  and that i actually had a connection with  if they didn t see the real me  infact there s no point in pursuing girls who don t like the real me   so i started being truly myself  not afraid to do weird shit  not afraid to share my unique interests and hobbies  acting like i do around my friends around girls i had interest in  or girls in general   and i noticed a massive shift  i became much more confident  i now have so much less apprehension in starting a conversation  hitting up a girl  i ve made real connections with girls i may have otherwise not ever talked to  and it weeds out girls that aren t compatible    i still have a ways to go  but i think this realization was crucial in building my future confidence   tl dr i may not have much experience  but if you want confidence and want to attract women and want real connections  be your      true self   edit  i didn t expect this to blow up at all  glad i could share this advice with so many people  ,0

im going out tonight after months of escaping from my social life  help me develop an healthy attitude  a friend of mine asked me to hang out with him and his friends tonight  he said he invited lots of girls too   i was like    ah shit  here we go again  what excuse am i going to find now     my mind immediately saw this as something painful and uncomfortable   but immediately after getting that thought  i realized it was not normal to see social life as a threat  i am human  and humans are social beings  also  i think that existence would be pointless without friends  social interactions  so i asked myself      why  why am i seeing this as something to escape instead of an opportunity   im a   yo guy  ive been shy and quiet for my whole adolescence  people know me as the guy who hasnt lots of friends  the guy who doesnt speak much   as years passed  i actually developed some confidence  self respect and my social skills slightly improved     however  i feel as if   my past is holding me back     its almost as if my thoughts and mind commands me to act like a shy quiet guy  because i am that guy  and people know i am that guy    and i get caught up in   past negative behaviour    i close myself off  i give up on trying to make conversation and actively socialize  when im in a social situation i just stand there  i stop trying to talk to others and wait for others to talk to me  i live as if all people ignore me and dont want to talk to me   when a person ignores me  i just assume that person doesnt like me  and i feel even more terrible  i lost friends because of that  in the end  i start escaping my social life  because whats the point of going out and not saying a word     but tonight  i choose to interrupt the pattern    i want to start seeing my social life and social skills as a   challenge      and tonight  its the perfect opportunity to test myself      what if i broke my self imposed limits    what if i let go of my past and irrational thoughts  and started being in the moment  being interested in others  and started socializing    what if i went out tonight and came back home knowing i have more acquaintances that could become friends or even lovers   what if i found the toughness and perseverence to keep going out despite my insecurities to gain momentum  so that i can improve my social skills and open myself to the world  ,0
 advice  three practical techniques i used to overcome social anxiety  https   youtu be uq  vuswmkyo  https   youtu be uq vuswmkyo     x   b     relationships of the heart are the most beneficial thing to any man      x   b   hey everyone  i  like many of you  have suffered from social anxiety for a very long time    im not sure exactly why  nor that it really matters  but it just happens that i get excessively nervous  constricted  and scared during social situations    or at least i used to        x   b   these are the three techniques that i used to get big results in decreasing my social anxiety over time        emulate confidence  in other words  emulate the  physical actions  and mannerisms of people who dont have social anxiety  so  if youre out and about  think about what someone who didnt have social anxiety would be doing  what would they look like  what actions would they take  how is their posture  where are they looking  what is their stride like   the idea is to almost  reverse engineer  your social anxiety  let your body experience what it feels like to have the appearance of confidence  remember     as you think  so shall you become     for me  this acted as a sort of priming  so that i acted the part  and then i eventually became the part        loosen up physically  people who are uncomfortable and nervous are usually more physically rigid and stiff  so youre going to do  the opposite  of this  jump around  move your body from side to side  and shake out your shoulders and hips   do this as many times as you need to  and  dont worry  about looking foolish  i dont care if its in the middle of the sidewalk  a party  or a crowded starbucks  youll be surprised how few people will even notice  and how much better youll actually feel   the idea here is to literally  shake out  some of your anxiety  just remember the quote     loose body  loose mind           practice in non consequential situations   one of the best ways to overcome social anxiety  just like anything else  at least for me   is through  practice and repetitions    so what do i mean by non consequential situations  a non consequential situation is any daily situation where you can practice your confidence and social skills without any real detriment to you if you appear awkward   next time youre going through the taco bell drive through  smile and make some small talk with the cashier  drop them a compliment and ask them how their day is going  this sounds stupidly simple but its effective   literally every store and every cashier is an opportunity for you to practice being more outgoing  more confident  and more assertive  remember that  especially if your social anxiety is moderate to severe  you have to   start somewhere       thats all  these three techniques may not work for everyone  but they certainly helped me chip away at my social anxiety piece by piece  and im betting that after a couple of weeks  youll see big results as well   hope it helps   d ,0
anyone feel like theyre great in a professional setting  but terrible in a casual social environment  for some context  im in business for myself and i feel im great at dealing with my clients and other industry professionals  moreover  my    year old self was the life of the party  i often hosted people during college and had a reputation for bringing people together  i used to dj a lot   im in my early   s now     x   b   i love the idea of bringing value to people and genuinely strive to do so every day and in every conversation that i have with others  i shine if you put me in front of someone whom i can help  im in real estate   in these situations there is a pre existing scenario that opens up the dialog and allows the convo to flow smoothly  however  when i find myself in a casual social environment i become really reserved and feel like i dont have much to say anymore  i could care less about the latest sports trade and typical small talk  which makes me feel dull or like i dont have much to contribute  most of the things i care about tend to be a bit taboo to talk about with a stranger  politics and finance   its to the point where i dont even like going out anymore  which often times makes me feel alone      x   b   anyone else ever feel this way  any advice on how to get out of this funk  ,0

how do you break the ice when you are alone and other people are in groups  ive been trying to meet new people and making new friends in common hobbies  so i try to go to meetups whenever possible  the thing is that most people go with someone else and stick with them  so it feels like im bothering them if i go talk to them  this allied to the lack of networking activities promoted by the organizers leave me feeling like im not enjoying this as much as i should  what are your tips for these situations  ,0
does anyone else here worry too much about what other people think of you and feel like this restricts your social opportunities and makes life less enjoyable for you than it should be  edit  didn t know this post would blow up the way it did  thanks everyone for the support and suggestions in the comments   ,0
who else is sitting at home  lonely as fuck right now on friday  i hate the thought that theres people out there  socializing  im just a lonely college kid about to get drunk  fun times    x   b   the worst thought is that the people from hs who were assholes to me are probably out having fun rn  being extraverted with shitty social skills is the worse  ,0
body language is so frustrating been reading some articles about body language and i just need to vent  how am i supposed to pay attention to all these microscopic signals and interpret what they mean  all while listening to what the other person is saying and being aware of what my own body language is conveying  all in real time  only a supercomputer would be capable of doing that  some of these details are so ridiculously minuscule  like change in pupil size  i cant even maintain eye contact without my mind going blank  the interpretation of some of these signals is so stupid and arbitrary  like why should arms being folded mean anything  or legs being crossed  theres nothing inherent in these gestures that suggests anything  and i read that giving off the sense that you are uncomfortable makes others uncomfortable  why should that be  if i felt someone else was nervous i would feel sympathetic and try to make them less nervous  i just hate that we ascribe so much significance to something that is not easy to control or understand  i really try to connect with people  but why cant my words be enough  ,0
want to be more likable  trust me when i tell you this   want to be more likable     there are hundreds of ways  but at the core of being likable are only a few basic things  be relatively positive  be an active participant in your conversations  and be a credible person   your word is one of the most important things you have in life  and it will help you get far if you dont ruin it  your word will help you get farther with relationships  both personal and professional     x   b     be someone others can trust    think about the people who say theyll show up at a certain time  but dont  or the people who say theyll get back to you  but dont  or the people who say theyll do something for you  but do a poor job    dont be that person    those people are incredibly frustrating  be someone others can rely on  be someone others can believe  be someone others can trust     x   b     get those goals    i used to be a guy who thought i could do everything myself  but ive realized  if i want to achieve any of my dreams or goals  i need other people  you cant get anywhere without good relationships  and if you want those relationships to last  you need to be a trustworthy  credible friend  mean what you say and do what you say youll do     x   b     want deeper conversations     if people trust you more  it means theyll trust you with their feelings  with their friendship  and youll reach deeper levels of the relationship  if people dont trust you  they may only stick to shallow levels of conversations with you     x   b   edit  for everyone asking about my blog  i post thoughts regularly  here  https   www socialupgrader com blog   thanks for the support and good luck to you     x   b  ,0
i    f  realized most of the social skills podcasts i m listening to are for guys  any advice on books or podcasts that are specifically for women  over the years i ve been trying to teach myself social skills and business etiquette from books  books  how to win friends  why motivating people doesn t work  the charisma myth    habits  podcasts  the art of likability  the art of charm   and i really appreciate everything i ve learned  i can go to networking meetups and make friends  at least moreso than i did before     but i ve noticed most of the social tips i find  especially for podcasts  are aimed at men   i m in a male dominated field  so this isn t a terrible thing  but i ve also had feedback from a number of people that i come across as having a rather masculine air  that i m a bit too direct and don t know how to navigate etiquette with groups of women   i feel this acutely when i m in a group of professional women around my age  mid to late twenties      i m not planning on overhauling my personality completely  but i d really love to learn more about how to navigate those situations as well  is there a modern day miss manner s podcast  or a book of similar information    tl dr i feel like a dense bull in a china shop and would appreciate any resources on learning how to navigate society for or written by women    ,0
i thought me deleting social media will mean that i ll meet less people  but that wasn t the case  my average screen time about two weeks ago reached    hours which is nuts  i felt like my whole life is rotating around it and around pleasing these stranger while trying so hard to impress them  literally nothing destroyed my social life more than social media ironically  everything that i did every skill i developed was just to impress people and not for me to feel proud of  and that fucking sucked   and after a week of deleting it  and as corny as this sounds i feel alive  and more motivated than ever   ,0
just asked out a girl     m in china  i just asked out a girl on christmas day    background  im a    year old chinese male high school student in china  the girl  also chinese  i asked out is in the homeroom next to mine  ive had a crush on her for more than a year  shes funny  talented  smart and super cute  because we were in seperate homerooms  we didnt really have much of a chance to get to know each other too well  just the odd chance to sit next to each other in some classes  work on a few school projects  we painted a mural at the school together   and went out a few times with friends  we are in the same group of friends   she seems to like me  shes friendly to me and laughs at my jokes    last month  i invited her to do a debate competition with me  it was a chance for us to get to know each other  we did quite well in the debate  and we had fun  i got back from the debate about a week ago  and decided i was going to ask her out this weekend  also our christmas holiday  four days break   the debate season ended and theres not really going to be a chance for us to hang out much more for the next few months  i decided to do it because if she rejected me  i would be no worse off than i am now  and if she accepts  well  thats just amazing   i have only had one relationship  that was about four years ago when i still lived in the uk  the girl asked me out  i did really like the girl though   and it ended after a few weeks  it was a mutual thing  i was really not ready for a relationship   i have asked out girls three times in total  all rejected  all were in the uk  and all were more than three years ago  i took it really badly  ever since  ive been kinda scared of rejection from girls  and shied away from relationships  plus  i was in china  and teenage relationships are not really very tolerated in my school  not my current school     i thought about it for a few days and decided i was going to ask the girl out  i talked with her best friend  who is my best friends girlfriend   and told her about my intentions  she congratulated me  and gave me a few tips   fyi  in china  asking a girl out is normally quite a big thing  and its quite normal for it to be a much more than a simple question like  will you go out with me     i wasnt really expecting her to say yes to me  i mean  she doesnt really know me too well  and she a few months ago got her heart broken by a guy she liked  this guy asked her out and broke up with her after two weeks to go after another girl  she thought long and hard about answering him for a few days to just have her heart broken   i wrote her a long text on qq  a message service literally everyone uses in china   and recorded her a video of me singing and playing a song on my piano  its one of my favourite songs  and it involves her english name   i sent it to her last night at   pm  her best friend suggested this time as she normally goes to sleep at   pm     the text told her how i felt  how i really like her  etc  and the fact that we didnt really have a chance to get to know each other  at the end  i wrote that she doesnt have to decide now and that i just want to tell her how i feel  which is my true intention    she responded to me fourty minutes later  she said that she was very surprised  and that she is very flattered and quite moved by it  she also really likes the song  she said that she has a lot of work on her plate right now  very true   she is not going to be giving an answer soon  and she needs a lot of time to think it through    honestly  i think it may just be her rejecting me in a nice way  or shes actually thinking it over  either way  im happy that i did this  i got the courage to ask a girl out  and i didnt take it personally when she didnt say yes   tdlr  i asked out a girl and am happy even though she didnt say yes     ill update if anything else happens   any thoughts  ,0

on breakups and lost friendships  i went through this thrice  and had a really hard time since i did certain things which made it even harder  until i realised which things actually mattered         resolve the break     the very first thing to do is to attempt to instill a positive image of your ex  while withdrawing your mental attachments from them  maybe it didnt work out  perhaps it was one sided  the  significant  other who just become an  other  is another person  resolving life as you are  and not all of their machinations can ever be available to you  you must live with that  and hope that they continue on their quest as best as they can  without you  if such is the case          sink yourself in things you enjoy     with the conscious process correctly set  the next is to convince your subconscious to withdraw from stimuli that would remind you of your ex  activities you enjoy  or give you the sense of accomplishment and self esteem will help you tremendously as theyll restore your sense of self love   a little different from being selfish   and give you a more favourable view on your life while also priming you towards a better set of options which may open up new paths   with respect to career  education  new relationships  romantic or civil   essentially revealing new futures          open up to your loved ones     your close ones are those whom you can trust  who insinuate the vibe of  home   it may be your family  close friends  foster parents  mentors  even your counsellor   contact them frequently  this will stimulate your social responsiveness  and ensure you dont go into a state of involuntary solitude  socialising is a primary activity for humans  and it is harmful if not done at a specific level  likewise  socialising and talking to your loved ones helps alleviate social stigma  and leads to better health overall          explore new things     once youre willing to go out of your comfort zone again  try going for newer experiences which broaden your perspective  it could be as simple as visiting a library  joining a zumba class  or even learning to crochet  or hiking  new experiences will help stimulate your brain to discard older patterns and take up newer ones   neuroplasticity at some level  new challenges will stimulate this further         look back and cherish what you have made of yourself     the final step is to validate your present self with respect to your past  your fresh perspective will baffle you   how you were mopping before  dependent on the joy the other gave you  instead of finding your inner light    relationships are the crux of eusocial animals like us  and theres bound to be friction in a lot of places  build your sense of inner worth  and those who adore you will flock to you like fireflies to a lamp  nay  a radiant sun  ,0

had the guts to unfriend a girl i dated so i met a girl on tinder  she was absolutely lovely and i met her a week later for drinks and card games  i personally thought it went really well and she asked me to message her when i got home which i did  but after meeting her  she started acting distant and not making a effort to message me  also when i tried to rearrange a  nd meet up  she told me she was gonna be busy which is understandable  over the next few weeks i sent her a few messages trying to initiate conversation and trying to be nice and crack jokes and i just wasn t feeling the chemistry   stopped talking to her for a few weeks and she didn t send me any messages so i put my foot down and straight up unfriended her  i don t want to waste my time when someone is clearly not interested  i kinda wish she just told me instead of trying to avoid me  ,0

i made a friend on the plane   a bit about me  im awkward and shy  and ive never had many interactions of my own in my life  so making friends and starting up conversations is a struggle   it was a    hour flight  and everyone on board had fallen asleep  well  except him and i  nine hours in  we both ordered coffee at the same time  and we had a laugh about that as it was an extremely stupid idea  but it turned out we had the same motif  we were taking a transit back to our  different  home countries in a few hours  i was worried the conversation would die out  and wed have to spend the rest of the four remaining hours in awkward silence   surprisingly  i was able to hold a conversation with him  and im not exaggerating this when i say ive never felt more comfortable talking to a stranger  we bonded over being the only ones awake  his love for physics and my hatred for it  my love for biology and  his  hatred for it  about capitalism  ai  traditions and so many more topics  we stayed together for two more hours in the airport until my second flight  had brunch  and i asked him for his number so we could stay in touch  kudos to you men  i never knew it could be so nerve wracking   he dropped me off to my gate and then left for his   im so proud of how far ive reached  the me from five months ago would have not been able to even reply from the start   edit  yes  were still in touch  its crazy to think that there are people around you that you could be great potential friend with  and that were the ones stopping ourselves from them  ,0

last night i made a real friend and i feel ready to live my life im a    year old woman and ive just met someone who changed my life in just one night  she never judged my social anxiety because she related and opened up to me about her life and she trusted me as well  i could tell her a lot of things as well  i cried and hugged her and we invited each other home  i felt intensely happy and she knew but she told me she was also happy about meeting me and wanted talk more with me and she liked the way i see things  she found me interesting and not weird  she saw me as a real human being with real feelings and struggles   i thought i had to share this here because ive struggled with social anxiety since i was a kid  im so full with emotions right now and i feel so satisfied with all that i have done to get here and accept that these emotions are good and im not bad  not everyone cares about me  not everyone is going to like me and thats okay  real friends show up sooner or later  and they will care  they will listen and you will be strong enough to go through everyday  nobody should ever give up  someone will want to know you  even when you are being awkward or extremely shy  the right people could be right next to you when you dont expect it   edit  thanks for the replies    i just want to add that  this is not only a new friend  but a learning experience  i knew  logically  that i wasnt alone  but there are things you dont really understand until you feel them  i dont want to depend on anyone  but actually feel confident that theres people out there who accept me and thats all that matters  im happy about this feeling and i want to make true friendships grow  i want to be that person who helps others  one day  ,0

advice for college students disclaimer i don t mean to offend anyone this is just based on my experience alone    as an engineering major and a female it s incredibly hard to make friends in any of my classes but i m almost complete with my sophomore year and i picked up on a few things       try to sit in different places in lectures because the person next to you might ask you a question or vice versa and can lead to a new friend instantly       giving out your number is not weird directly after conversing with someone new in your class because almost always they ll assume it s for homework what d i miss in class help       going to tutoring sessions with a ta running it is a totally less stressful social environment and leads to fantastic discussions and friend study groups       study groups  don t be afraid to ask to join  almost never will someone reject you for wanting extra help inputs on problems and they usually end with  well i m going to fail but this was so fun        going to random seminars on campus even if it s not for your major can introduce you to so many new connections and friends  don t be too picky with the people you surround yourself with  too old young different major non students   because they can all contribute your social and academic life       eating studying hanging out alone around campus can sometimes lead you to something exciting  i was reading a book alone outside and a couple of girls asked me if i wanted to participate in their club sport  can t remember the name but you hit a small ball in the middle of a tiny trampoline   got their numbers and joined a club i never heard of       almost every other person you encounter is also trying to find their way and probably accepting of new people in your life  every new person you talk to gives you a blank slate of how you present your personality  college is all about molding the person you re going to be for a good portion of your life  if you fucked up with that person  try again       branch out your interests  when a person is crazy passionate about something  there s definitely a reason and worth getting to know more about it  made a friend in cs and he invited me to his new dnd campaign and it s one of my favorite times of the week now    i hope any of this helps  because it helped me   ,0
i feel like i go through periods where i can socialize very well and all of a sudden for whatever reason i cant after a while i feel awkward again its a confusing title so ill explain it as best i can  so i was really awkward up until a few months ago where i feel like things were really starting to pick up for me and i knew what i was doing  i had plenty of friends made plenty of new friends and talked to people i didnt know that well more often  i could make people laugh fairly often too  for whatever reason though for everytime i feel this way an awkward phase comes through and i feel like im  back at square one  its like ive forgotten how to socialize time and time again and i try too hard to be funny and the things i say tend to end awkwardly  then sometimes things will pick up and i start making people laugh and have good conversations again until the awkward phase consumes me again  one minute i feel confident laid back and can make people laugh and talk easily for a week next minute im awkward obsessed with trying to think of a joke or even come up with something to say  ive read through these threads many times and while they have worked in the past they just feel useless all of a sudden  anybody got any advice to cope with this   edit  ive been reading through your advice  im glad its not just me  i feel more confident and ready to take on the world than i have in a good while now  thanks   ,0
lessons ive learned throughout my high school journey i went from that small  quiet kid that wore flannel and listened to mcr all the time to an outgoing  class rep   theatre nerd  here is what i wish i knew freshmen year     x   b      youre      dont even think about growing taller  just accept it  its not a big deal     the harder you try to be macho and not look stupid  the stupider you look     its ok to like babies  theyre cute  youre supposed to like them     peoples opinions of you mean nothing     the key to being optimistic is to not shit on yourself all the time     be confident     you have chest scars  girls will love them     quit being so uptight     youre smart but not  as  smart as you think  hard work beats all in the end      its ok to embarrass yourself      take  reasonable  risks      youre not a tough  badass edgelord  youre     teen with a heart condition who loves babies  puppies  pokemon  and   s   s rock bands  ,0
as a formerly shy person  i had a realization about shy people earlier today   being shy makes it hard for others to talk to you  in the past i was very shy  bad social skills  have improved quite a bit in the last few years  and im totally comfortable with talking to strangers or new people    im still soft spoken and i dont talk that often  but all of the anxiety i used to feel in those situations is gone  which is nice    so anyway  i work at a grocery store as a bagger  a new cashier started recently and i had introduced myself the first day i saw her  learned her name  the city she came from  and that we go to the same university  but she didnt ask anything about me in return  which was a little discouraging  im also new to town   always interested in mutual getting to know each other situations whenever possible     got to work earlier today and she was there  at which point i had the sudden realization that shy people are hard to talk to  i wanted to chat  but just couldnt think of a single thing to say  even though i have no problem talking to the rest of my co workers who im already familiar with   i guess the point i wanted to make with this post is that  if you are shy and someone strikes up a conversation with you  dont be afraid to share information about yourself  also  be sure to ask them the same questions in return  the more you know about each other  the easier it is to have future conversations  especially with the basics out of the way   any tips for my specific situation  what do i do when ive had a brief conversation with someone  would like to have some more back and forth  but am not feeling acquainted with them yet  thats just an area im still uncomfortable with  and id like to work on ironing that out when possible ,0
would you be friends with yourself  i know many people   including myself   complain about how nobody likes us because of our bad social skills   but ask yourself this  would you be friends with yourself  if the answer is  no   then maybe you have genuine problems you should fix   i feel as though i probably wouldnt have been friends with myself in the past   and probably in the now   because i had have too much emotional baggage  however  if i took the time to get to know myself  i would see a lot of redeeming qualities and i would keep myself around in my life even if i was a mental wreck     edit    wow i didnt expect this to blow up so fast   ,0
   m and i have no friends  i feel sick of life sometimes  i have always had no people in my life that i can call friends  i m very so an introvert  i hate meeting new people  talking to people and when i do ever get the rare chance to make a friend  i blow it because i m always super paranoid that i might do something wrong or i d think  they only hang out with me cause they feel sorry for me      the friends i did have in high school were only pretending to like me  i hung out with them all throughout secondary school up until that very moment one of them specifically informed me that  no one in our group really liked you  we didn t say so cause we didn t want to hurt your feelings   oh wow  it broke me  i dropped out of school and am working now  all the people i meet at work love telling funny story s of what they did on the weekend with their friends  funny and stupid teenage things   all i tend to think is   i wonder what it feel like to get drunk with my friends on the weekend   oh wait    what friends    my typical weekend is always sleeping in  playing video games  baking and eating  i m sick of it  well  at least i was sick of it  until i kind of just    got used to it  now   i love staying at home    alone  i hate going out  literally  i do feel lonely sometimes  but hey what s masturbation and good ole video games can t fix  right    right    i think i m mentally sick  i always feel tired even though i sleep enough every god damn day  i m starting to take of myself  i really hate my body  i worked myself to lose a whole    kgs     lbs  off my body in   month   i just need someone to talk to  is that too much to ask for  ,0
finally got around to actually talking to a girl i like  for once i know it makes no logical sense to have issues talking to girls  especially if you are aiming to be attractive confident  and i know that this is pretty pathetic for a guy in his early   s  but just being realistic honest with myself here   my social skills were completely non existent in the past  ive gone through many scenarios were i thought a girl in class was cute and just never did anything about it  but ive really been trying to improve for the last few months  so this was a milestone i wanted to share   i met a girl in one of my clubs at college last semester  shes rather quiet  so even though im a work in progress  ive been doing my best to be proactive  i introduced myself before a meeting once  and then had a short conversation with her at an end of semester event  at which point i figured out we were going to have a class together   so last week was the first week of classes and i completely failed at talking to her in class  but i did run into her on the way back to my car one day and had a quick little  how was your break   chat in the parking lot  that actually ended up helping me get the confidence to sit right next to her today and it went pretty well  i slipped up on some words but it didnt feel too awkward  and i think she was just glad to have someone to talk to  we also had a club meeting after class and i sat next to her  we walked out of the room chatting with each other and it felt very  normal  for once  then of course i slipped up and said  see you on tuesday  as we parted ways  meant to say thursday lol   but whatever   from this point i am just going to take it class by class and try not to expect too much  for all i know she may have an so or may not like my face  its not a pretty sight  but im making the best of it   regardless  it will definitely be nice to have someone to sit next to in class  and i am just really happy that i was able to prove something to myself   now i can think back on this if i ever have doubts about my capabilities ,0
in my opinion  the secret to being confident stop looking at yourself  just stop it  whether it be taking photos  looking in mirrors  whatever  just stop  it s factual that we have a negativity bias towards ourselves so the more we look at ourselves the more flaws or things that aren t even bad we pick at and get self conscious of  ever seen a photo of yourself with friends and they say  god i look bad in this  meanwhile you look at them and think  what re they talking about  i look horrible  yeah  that  you d be pleasantly surprised how little people care about what others look like and how self absorbed and conscious of themselves that everyone is  another example  ever seen someone pretty bad looking  given i don t ever think anyone is horrible looking  everyone always has something going for them  but anyway  do you even think of them in   mins  an hour  a day   no  you forget about them straight away and especially don t go home and think  wow that person looked shocking today  so why would you think people do that to you  sure there s some assholes in this world that may treat people differently based on how they look but that isn t anything on you but in fact something wrong with the person treating them differently  so going back to confidence  take pride in how you look but don t obsess  if you know you re a good person then your personality will shine through and confidence will grow from not caring what you look like in social situations but instead people will focus on what a genuine  great person you are  we have one life folks  enjoy it   tldr  we have a negativity bias  we always think we look worse than we actually do  take great steps in instead making yourself a great person on the inside realising that everyone has their own troubles and concerns about themselves and will never prolong on something about you that they don t like  ,0

you have to break out the comfort zone  im a    years old introverted boy which didnt have many with girls  i have many friends  both male and females  and they all like me and find me funny  but i just had   girl  she broke up with me after a week    years ago and im still a virgin  most of the fault is my teenage years  but i wont talk about this  just know i found my real first friend when i was       my life is pretty monotonous  i had the same group of friends for over a year and hardly know new people  despite this  im okay with my life  i have good grades and i cant complain  i have a good mental health and ive never been depressed   lately im starting to want to change my life into better  stepping out the comfort zone  especially with girls    tonight i asked out a female friend  a really cool gal and i really like her  i asked out by phone  this was really hard for me since i always talk with people via texting  or vocal notes   and was my really first step out my comfort zone  we first went to a café to take something to drink  we talked a lot  but still monotonous    i wanted to try something new  so i asked her to break in the middle school property  not inside the building  but going to the courtyard  and she said yes really quickly  sadly  in the middle schools courtyard there was a bunch of guys and she was scared of going there  even though my town is small and not really dangerous   so we went to the train station  is like    m away from the school   we started to joke and started to tell ghost stories  i tried to make some moves but didnt really know what she wanted  since im really clumsy with girls and cant read into them    i wanted to kiss her  but  something held me back  we were going back to the car  when i remembered some words an older friend told me     if you dont try to kiss her you will never know if shes into you or not  and maybe in the next years you will regret this  because you wont know what couldve happened if you tried     i thought that it would hurt more living in regret that feeling a little bit of shame  and i stopped her  in a cringy way  and i tried to kiss her    she obviously rejected me  but i felt open  i told her i wanted to try to kiss her and wanted to exit the comfort zone  because i never did anything like this and i wanted to be straightforward  shes been comprehensive and were still friends  i felt a bit of shame but now i feel light and open    at the end i had a nice evening with a friend  and now i feel more confident  i will remember this bittersweet experience with joy  and wont feel regret about being apathetic     x   b   my advice for you is  whenever you feel uncomfortable to do something social   for example talking to aquaintances at school to make new friends  asking a girl out  always call her  never text her   trying to kiss a girl   do it  do what your guts tell you  even if the brain is scared and the heart beats fast  always try to do new things  meet new people and seize the moment  this july i will go all by myself to the other side of my country to listen my favourite band  i cant wait for that experience and i hope itll change my life in better    i hope ill help someone in my situation  ,0
theres a girl i used to go to school with who never greets me i never greet her  should i just say hi to her  we were in the same class in elementary school and we still see each other now because we go to the same high school  not in the same class  and take the same bus  but i never say hi to her and she never says hi to me and im not sure whose fault it is  one side of me thinks she doesnt say hi to me cause im a loser  but what if i started it all  what if she thinks i hate her as much as i think she hates me  i mean  shes always been a very nice girl  so maybe  im  the asshole here  should i just say hi to her next time i see her on the bus  im shy as fuck so it wouldnt be easy   but what do i have to lose   edit  guess i shouldve clarified that  where im from  being in the same class in elementary school means seeing each other for five hours a day almost every day for five years  so yeah  we were friends   not best friends or anything  just friends the way a    year old girl and a  very shy     year old boy are friends  i honestly didnt expect so many people to reply to this post  thank you to everyone who did    so i kinda half assed it  ,0
how do i develop a personality or show my personality when talking to someone  i m not really sure if i have a personality or not  because whenever i talk to someone i don t really have anything to say  literally everyone i talk to says  you re the quietest person i ve ever meet   i don t want to be quiet  but i always freeze up and can t think of anything to say  sometimes when i m in a long conversation i ll just zone out completely  because i find it boring or i get too nervous  this is frustrating  because when i m by myself i wish that i was talking to someone  but then when i am taking to someone i just want to escape from the conversation  ,0

if your new friend is a jerk to other people  don t dismiss their toxic behavior just because they re still nice to you  if your  friend  is excessively cruel towards other people but is nice to you  don t expect for this front to last   i know this from experience  i used to have toxic friends who had zero chill when lashing out at people who didn t really deserve to be lashed out at  yet they d still be very kind and sweet when interacting with me  trust me when i say that this only lasted six years  before they started showing me their toxic side too   if a person treats other people like garbage right in front of you  even if they don t treat you like that  trust me when i say that they are showing you their true colors  anybody who is actually a good person would never derive pleasure from treating other people like shit  so just because they re being nice to you now  doesn t mean that they re going to continue being nice to you if you decide to continue maintaining a relationship with them    when you see your new  friend  being an asshole to other people  please accept the fact that they re an asshole  don t bank on the fact that they re still nice to you  for the time being   otherwise you ll be setting yourself up for a lot of emotional abuse in future interactions  ,0

my final quarter at a school known for  fun   think ucsc  asu kind of places  i ve failed to make even one friend here  when i started off in the dorms  my former roommate was a very chill  very popular guy  to his credit  he made an effort to include me  i was still super inhibited and got really anxious even just hanging out with the folks from our floor  so the invites became less and less frequent  i also was never added into their group chat  despite asking multiple times   campus orgs  same deal  i joined one of the more semi professional ones  and grew to be very respected there and contributed a great deal  never really became  part of the group   though   i tried going to the tabletop games association a couple times  but everyone seemed to already have their playgroups established  i got nervous about barging in on existing playgroups  so i took my games and left without speaking to anyone  or even being seen  as far as i know    i m living alone right now because i couldn t find any roommates to live with  so my poor social skills are costing my family actual money   i m seeing a mental health professional  i do feel better about myself  but still feel cripplingly shy and insecure around others  i m  on the spectrum   though that  diagnosis  was from when i was very young  and the doctors refused to put a definitive label like aspergers or asd on me  perhaps they would now that i m older  and have the unfortunate tendency to speak in an excessively technical and over intellectualized manner  punctuated by stutters  asides  and generally giving people the impression of being an annoying egghead  i have quite a few interesting stories and anecdotes  but ye gods i m horrendously bad at telling them in a way that is actually interesting and engaging   it feels pretty bad to go to a college like this one and totally fail to make any new friends  i m trying to be better  and it doesn t seem to be working very well  i can t help but feel this experience reflects very poorly on me   what does one do if they aren t able to  find their tribe   so to speak  even among circles one would think i d do well in  geeks and gamers  i end up being the weirdly awkward guy that people are nice enough to  but don t care to get to know me or be known by me  ,0

i can t keep a conversation going for the life of me  when ever i talk to someone new  it always dies after the introduction  i have no idea why    i literally feel awful because i know that i can talk to people and i have the confidence to approach people  but i never have any idea what to say  ,0
the hotel i was staying at i alway made a point of acknowledging the stuff as in  hello how are you  just so i could practice becoming confident in starting a conversation  until one day the receptionist told me   my boss wants to meet you   i recently moved to another country and had no friends  and i was super anxious about  but i made a conscious decision to become more confidentand practice on the hotel staff xd  but what ended up happening is that they perceived me to be very sociable and because of it ended up offering me a job   the one thing i have come to realise is the importance of practical experience  not everybody was dealt the extroversion card but that doesn t mean you cannot practice  what i started off doing was challenging myself in small increments  i was always afraid of rejection so i would position myself strategically so that i d never get rejected  i e practice talking to the elderly  greeting the receptionist  making small talk with jehovah witnesses  these are people who are keen to talk to you and would not ever think of not engaging you in small talk   over time i would increase the challenge by small steps    e g  asking strangers for directions  until i was confident enough  eventually  i would purposely put myself in a disadvantaged position where rejection was imminent but not personal  e g  picking up a sales job or taking comedy classes where people throw tomatoes at you   and at that point i realise that the anticipation of rejection was actually worse than the actual rejection    i did all of this one year before i moved abroad and now i cannot believe my luck that i was offered a job for  being sociable  https   youtu be uleieo   dc      ,0
i met a girl at college  and want to keep a conversation going with her  i know this question has been asked a thousand times  but i still need some help   i met this girl at college and she seemed fun  so i started talking to her online  but most of the conversations end up being about college stuff  i wanted to talk about other stuff  get to know her  but every time i want to do that  in my head i cant think of a way to do it  without it being like an interview   how do i introduce new topics to a conversation  in a normal way  without sounding like a detective   another question i have is  is it dumb to ask her out  after only talking about the previously mentioned stuff   i want to add that im quite introverted  so other than my closer friends  i have a bit of trouble talking to less known people  ,0
today  i went to a bar alone and had a good time  i made this throwaway account only to write about my journey of social skill self improvement  battle against anxiety etc       today i was bored  but i was feeling pretty good  i realized there was a ufc fight and i decided to go to a bar by myself to watch it  normally  this is a scary idea for me  i dont even feel comfortable going to bars nightclubs with friends due to my anxiety  but i just said fuck it and went to this place  i had conversations with strangers  enjoyed a few beers and called it a night  after the night was over  it felt like an accomplishment   ,0
i m starting to be more outgoing  but i always feel so awkward just like the title says  i ve come really far these past few months in terms of trying to be more sociable  but i can t help but always feel so awkward when i m in public   i m constantly worried about if other people think i look weird or if i m looking okay or if people can tell i m awkward and it results in me looking in me trying to avoid looking at people  especially someone looking at me  and putting my hands in my pockets or pretending to look at my phone so i don t feel awkward   is there anything i can do to stop feeling so damn awkward every time i m out   ,0
can puberty mess up your social skills i remember before the age of     i was a social butterfly  had many friends  people liked me  i was the popular kid in middle school  then at the age of     i started high school where i didn t know any one  i went in there expecting to have a fun high school experience but i remember walking into my first class and anxiety hit me really hard  i was surprised  from that point  i ve been mentally unstable  social anxiety  low self esteem  desperation  negative self talk  depression  lack of motivation  i think about my old self and miss him so much  what the hell happened to me  one thing i m skeptical about is i started using porn heavily at    and got addicted  i don t know if this has anything to do with it  thanks    ,0
as a lurker  thanks  i suck at posting long paragraphs cause i never know what to actually write in them and i forget stuff   to keep this short ive been lurking here for a while and seeing little bits of information that i felt i could use and did use has built up my confidence significantly   alongside some other stuff  saying yes to events i want to go to has been the best piece of advice i could have followed as it puts me where i want to be and i stop worrying about things being  perfect   im making friends now as a result   ive also discovered that i love photography when on an all day walk and that i can be pretty fun    thanks r socialskills   ,0

had a fun moment with an absolute stranger was at mammoth mountain with my university club  a friend was following me towards the rentals   i was in a super good mood today  i was just beaming smiling for no reason   as i turned a corner this cute girl heading the opposite hallway from me made eye contact  started giggling then said    heyyy wipe that smile off your face   i yelled like a evil cartoon character  neverrrrr   then we both laughed as we walked away  my friend who was  based on her face enjoyably confused  asked me  do you know that girl    i happily said  nope    just feels good to casually react to strangers who wanted to interact with me  i felt like i was on some temporary unstoppable social god mode for a few mins if that makes sense lol ,0

how i became less creepy      sherlock holmes was my idol      i grew up believing that having emotions generally was a weakness  the closer i could get to the ideal of having no emotions whatsoever  the more  rational   and therefore happy i would become  the less emotion i could show and experience  the better   also  i felt isolated all the time  i couldn t connect with anyone  and when i tried  i just made people uncomfortable  if i didn t know anyone in a room  i d learned that meeting new people   badtimesnofun  so i d generally hide in the corner and plot my escape as soon as possible    being around people i didn t already know felt like i was scuba diving  able to look but never touch or connect  lost in a sea that wasn t made for me    i didn t make the connection between these two things for longer than i d like to admit      x   b         your smile isnt effective      i had no clue how to respond    no one had ever said anything even remotely close to that to me  but it was one of the most life changing sentences i d ever received from someone   no one could read me  so no one was even interested in making the attempt   my lust for not being emotional meant the volume of my outward emotional expression was too quiet for people to hear  my emotions were like me whispering about my favorite types of cheese  manchego  brie  gruyere  while i was dodging elbows in the middle of a mosh pit    if your emotions don t speak  you ll never be heard   without any clear cues for others to read  strangers would generally keep their distance from me  leaving me to think they were just dumb  my carefully cultivated dry humor made people visibly unhappy unless they were a close friend  also leading me to think people were just dumb  attempts at talking to new people  on the rare occasion that i made them  would cause people to change seats so they weren t sitting next to me  so naturally  i know you get the pattern so i won t finish    yeah  i know  yep  i know   i m being honest about who i was   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  pwkg  how i started to find other people more    people weren t dumb  people were  uncertain  about me     x   b        uncertainty is a building block of  creepy  and  uncomfortable      when people lack enough information to understand a situation clearly  people tend to fill in the blanks with their own biases    often  we have a negative bias towards strangers  so uncertainty leads to a default negative first impression  if i m stopped by a stranger on the street who looks me dead in the eye while saying   i ve got something in the back of my van to show you  please join me it will only take a moment    he could mean literally anything  even good stuff  but chances are it s not tickets for two to an all you can eat crawfish boil    that d be awesome though      in an academic survey of what constitutes  creepiness   francis mcandrew and sara koehnkeof expand on the role that uncertainty plays in creepiness    a mugger who points a gun in your face and demands money is certainly threatening and terrifying  yet  most people would probably not use the word  creepy  to describe this situation      it is our belief that creepiness is anxiety aroused by the ambiguity o whether there is something to fear or not and or by the ambiguity of the precise nature of the threat  e g   sexual  physical violence  contamination  etc  that might be present  such uncertainty results in a paralysis as to how one should respond     when people lack enough information to understand a situation clearly  people tend to fill in the blanks with their own biases  if your emotions and language don t give people enough information to determine otherwise  it s easy for others to assume you re  creepy    weird   or  a weircreepidoodle       x   b        how clear are your conversational signals     so how do i reduce uncertainty when i m talking to someone new  what s that mean for a generally emotionally flat person like myself  do i have to fake being a shiny happy person      in order to connect   thank fuck no  that s exhausting    you reduce uncertainty by increasing the strength and clarity in your communication  in this case  your emotions and intent      when you interact with people  show emotion     larger and     longer than you usually do      smile bigger than you re used to when meeting someone new  make sure it s very obvious to people what emotion you re currently feeling with strong  clear  hard to miss signals      the easier you are to understand  the more you ll be understood   as mentioned previously   a large amount of improving social skills is about reducing uncertainty and fear in others   https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  vv  j what the fuck even is small talk a toodamnlong    if you naturally don t show much emotion  this will feel  strange as helllllllllllllllllllllllllll   don t be surprised if you feel uncomfortable and unnatural at first  especially if what s so far been natural to you isn t getting you the warm conversations you want  if you under emote by default like i do  what feels like a  weird and uncomfortable  level of expressing emotion is actually where more expressive people s natural comfort levels are    after i started seeing how much friendlier it made everyone i interacted with  though  i got over the discomfort  fast   it was like i just discovered some shortcut that i m sure social skills speedrunners had known for years   after you practice expressing your emotions more clearly for a while  you may have to adjust based on how people react  so use your judgement  for me  it took a looooong time to get to a point where i was showing too much emotion because of my baseline  but your results may vary   so to recap  here s an exercise    the next time you meet someone new  try to smile and show emotion     larger and     longer than you usually do  see how the interaction changes      if it works  great  make note and adjust   if it doesn t work  go ahead and toss some shitposts in the comments  i    shitposts    ,0
as a non drinker  i hate how so many social activities revolve around alcohol seriously  it sucks  im    and i prefer not to drink for a couple different reasons  but all anyone ever wants to do is go out to a bar or a club or somewhere else that serves alcohol and just drink  i usually dont bother going anywhere like that because who wants to be that guy ordering water while everyone else is drinking alcohol  it just seems crazy awkward and i feel judged for choosing to remain      sober  i usually dont like places like bars anyway  even if they didnt serve alcohol  because theyre just factories for meaningless small talk   why is it so hard to find people like me who just want to have a good time without alcohol  what happened to hanging out and going places without the expectation that alcohol will be consumed  and why is alcohol such a mainstay in society that people who dont enjoy it will be looked down upon by some people   just had to rant a little and get that off my chest  ,0
give up being perfect  it s ok to say silly things and mess up  it s ok to make mistakes and not say exactly what s on your mind  it s ok to not be perfect    let go of the act of impressing others  let go of the feeling of being judged by others   immerse yourself in the present moment and enjoy every moment that unfolds right before you whether if you re talking to strangers  talking to your friends or talking to someone you like   you will never get those moment back again and it s such a damn waste of time to be overthinking about how things could go wrong  how you might not be good enough for the person or how the person might not like and reject you    i hope this helps someone out there today cause realising this has really helped me become more content  ,0
how to become more charismatic   a practical analysis of dwayne the rock johnson and how he uses the principles outlined in how to win friends and influence people      how to win friends and influence people like the rock       charismatic people have always interested me  i have wondered which characteristics make a person more or less charismatic  someone who interested me was dwayne  the rock  johnson  undoubtedly one of the most charismatic celebrities      after re reading one of my favourite books of all time  how to win friends and influence people  by dale carnegie  i couldn t help but notice some parallels between the principles outlined in the book and the rocks actions  i decided to make a practical book summary  social analysis to outline many of the principles and show you how the rock uses them     i have made a video with clips of the rock for those that want to watch that       viideo breakdown    https   www youtube com watch v jvwhterkrsa   now let s get into these principles      principle    don t criticize  condemn or complain     now  this principle isn t about allowing people to harass you  it s about becoming more grounded during social interactions  people who are charismatic rarely complain or condemn other people  this is because these actions often bring down the energy of the room   have you ever had a friend who always complained  after a while that shit gets annoying  doesnt it  take the positive approach  don t bring down the energy  instead elevate it and people will want to be around you more      how the rock applies this    in the first clip  the rock is bombarded by hundreds of fans who are trying to get his autograph  one fan  in particular  keeps insisting that the rock pay attention to him repeatedly asking him to say  hey donna  to the camera   obviously  in this case  the fan is being inconsiderate and doesn t understand how suffocating his behavior is  dwayne could have easily ignored him or insulted him  but that would have ruined the energy of the room  he instead obliges to the request while keeping his cool            principle     give honest and sincere appreciation      human beings love appreciation  for many people  it is one of their highest needs in life   in the workplace financial rewards are often not enough to keep people motivated  what people often want is to be acknowledged  people want to feel valued  charismatic people understand this all too well  this is why they give honest and sincere appreciation    it doesn t matter how small the action was that the other person did for you  a simple  thank you  can influence their perception of you greatly  sometimes we forget to show appreciation because we fail to understand the gravity of small honest gestures  take the time to show appreciation to those you encounter and you will stand out     how the rock applies it     if you follow the rock s social media you will notice that he is constantly giving thanks to his fans  it doesn t matter how much money he has made  for him giving honest and sincere appreciation is incredibly important  this is part of the reason that he has been known as  the people s champ         principle    become genuinely interested in other people      many people can t focus on one thing for too long  they suck at conversations because they get distracted as soon as the notification bell pops up on their phones  charismatic people are different  they are genuinely interested in other people   you don t have to like everyone that you meet  you can  however  show some interest when you encounter them  try to understand why they behave the way that they behave  remember that every social interaction can teach you something about the world        principle    smile      is it really that hard to smile once in a while   nope   however  it s a simple tweak that makes a world of difference in how approachable you appear to be        principle    be a good listener  encourage others to talk about themselves       this principle goes hand in hand with principle    don t be the person who cuts people off during conversations  take the opposite approach and allow them to speak  it is difficult to find a good listener in this world  so having this skill alone will make people love you  don t forget that people love to hear the sound of their own voice  let them have it       how the rock uses  principles       and      in the video  there is a very good example of him using all of these principles during an interaction  next time you watch someone charismatic  try and notice how engaged they are during conversations  you will see that many of them live by these principles        principle     if you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically      don t get stuck in your ego  if you make a mistake own up to it and move on  there is nothing more shameful than a person who cannot admit their own mistakes  people that take responsibility for their mistakes are comfortable in their own skin   this is an admirable quality  often times  people will respect you more for just owning up to it     how the rock uses it    in the video  dwayne recounts a story of him aggravating a pe teacher during high school   the teacher couldn t do anything about it because dwayne was     and    lbs   he explains how he felt bad and personally apologized to the teacher the next day        principle     begin in a friendly way      the beginning of a conversation sets the tone for the rest of it  it is important that you begin in a friendly way  allow the other person to feel safe and to put down their guard  this is something that most charismatic people do  they make us feel as if we have known them our whole lives  the ability to do this requires you to also put down your guard when entering a social interaction  you can t be too caught up in your head for this to work     how the rock uses it     despite his huge frame  the rock does not come off as intimidating  he heavily uses  bro hugs  when talking to people  if you watch the clip you can see that he incorporates a kinesthetic approach when talking to people  dwayne often has his hands around peoples shoulders  and will not hesitate to touch you somehow during the conversation this use of touch affects people on a subconscious level  without them knowing they will feel more attracted to him          principle     dramatize your ideas      this principle most heavily relates to when you are telling a joke  if you are going to crack a joke  be all in it  don t half ass it  many comedians understand this principle  look at dave chappelle  kevin hart  or will ferrell  when they tell a joke  they are not worrying about how stupid they look  something is incredibly attractive about someone who can let loose and enjoy themselves   think of a guy in the center of the dance floor dancing terribly  while everyone chants them on  it would be easy to call that person a loser  while you laugh and holding your drink leaning against the wall  however  deep down inside  you will envy that person for their ability to truly not give a fuck     how the rock uses it     part of the reason dwayne is so popular is due to his ability to dramatize  people still call him  the rock   despite him not being active in wrestling  this is because he is pretty much still the same guy  his character was exaggerated for wwe  however  that charisma is truly his  you can tell from his interactions and the jokes that he cracks that he is someone who is comfortable in his own skin      be charismatic    ok that ends my post  i know it s been long but i hope you learned something from it  if you haven t already  make sure you check out the book  how to win friends and influence people    i have only gone through a handful of the concepts explained in it   now  remember  you don t need to be the rock to be charismatic  you can become more charismatic by incorporating some of the principles explained in this post  good luck  ,0
how staying chill gives you an advantage in any social situation  what makes situations awkward  making them awkward of course  how can one make situations awkward though  simply by giving too much meaning to whatever provokes this feeling of anxiety    if you remind yourself to stay calm you are going to become a social leader  you have to adopt the mindset that nothing can break your calmness  only then you will barely be part of an embarrassing situation again and you will be seen as head of most situations   example  you talk to someone you just met and run out of topics  what do you do  well most people would have a continuous loop of  awkward  awkward  what should i do  shit  running in their heads  the solution here is to stay calm and do whatever you want to do  if you still feel like talking to that person you could go for  so tell me something else about you   or start to talk about your dreams or whatever  just talk about whatever you want to talk about  and if you actually feel like carry on talking to that person is a given by social standards but you do not really feel like it   then just go wherever you would have gone anyway  this does not mean you should be rude  definitely not  you dont have to be an asshole  just say something like  hey it was nice talking to you but i gotta go    how can you get there  well  there are many ways  the one i use is to imagine that my life is a video game and im the hero  i picture this hero as always walking around like nothing can get to his nerves  while this sounds ridiculous it really worked for me  every time i am in a social situation that develops to be unwell i kind of brush it off me by picturing that cool guy in my head and looking for what he would do   this technique helped me to get rid of social anxiety  i used to be nervous and avoid people and  risky  social situations  like parties  meetings  etc   and now i am able to embrace those events  i believe that not giving moments that crucial importance that makes one nervous is really the key here  i have found it a lot easier to make friends now   have you also made experiences with this strategy  what techniques do you use   ,0
how to come out of self isolation   over the past few years i have struggled with keeping in touch with the people in my life  aside from the fact that i enjoy being alone  i tend to get very caught up in my head   the last few years of my life i ve been in college and i have screwed up a lot academically  it has affected my confidence in myself  about halfway through my time in college  i had worked hard to get involved and had a network of people  some that i d call friends  other people had rejected me or decided that they didn t like me and while i accepted it  moved on  it made me feel like something was wrong with me   overtime i distanced myself and cut them off because i didn t feel welcome in the group  i only kept one friend from that group   now it seems that person has given up on me    i realize that i ve been ashamed of myself for the last few years and this has caused me to isolate myself more and more  i don t hit my friends up to hang out because they re going to ask if i have an offer for after graduation yet    i haven t told them i have another year of school left because i think i look stupid   i ve stopped calling my family as much because telling them what s happening in my life is kind of exhausting    it s to the point where i could go missing and nobody would realize for a solid week   so i guess i d like to know   what have you done to accept yourself and your failures  and be proud of yourself regardless   how do you work on establishing new friends when you ve isolated yourself  i am basically starting from scratch   i realize i m pretty lonely and i don t even know where to start  i have a problem where i assume people will not like me and honestly not many people even seem to like me  so that just confirms it and keeps the cycle of isolation going  ,0
being bad at socializing in the past actually gave me some perks i didnt know  i was socially inept during my teenage period which killed my self esteem so hard that i still suffer from it  surprisingly  thanks to that  i can learn to appreciate a lot of things that people who are naturally good at socializing often bug off  its like a starving kid who can appreciate food much more than a kid in the middle class who always has something on the table  just some small gesture is already enough to make my day  i feel so happy that      a co worker of mine decided to sit next to me while there were many empty seats around      the accountant girl jokingly told me that she brought booze to work when it was just coconut juice      the new girl at work  not the annoying one whos constantly nitpicking  told me that im cute and much more trustworthy than others      the it guy whos often cold to strangers now warmed up to me and can laugh with me      the senior co worker whos despite being socializing but still very guarded has openly discussed her passion with me   how ironic that the very past that made me shove a rag into my mouth to cry  made me want to kill myself several times and destroyed my self esteem now act as a filter to help me appreciate small yet wonderful things in life   if youre suffering like i did  i hope my story can bring you some optimist to overcome yours current obstacle  when the worst part of your life past  you will feel better than ever before and much more stronger than you can even imagine  ,0

want to instantly improve your eye contact and confidence  try these easy tweaks    the art of effective eye contact         one of the simplest ways to make you appear more confident is to start making conscious effort to hold eye contact   theres a real art to powerful eye contact as its much deeper than just staring someone down   start paying attention to how much youre holding eye contact with people  most people are afraid of eye contact and dont hold it enough   eye contact can be uncomfortable because too much subcommunicates that youre either interested in fornicating or fighting   naturally awkward people tend to shy away from both of these outcomes   holding eye contact might seem scary or rude if done over the top but its actually the most polite thing you can do when someone is listening   plenty of people have been in a conversation feeling that the other person isnt listening   proper eye contact shows youre engaged with the person talking while projecting massive confidence          challenge    evaluate how much eye contact youre making and begin making a conscious effort to just start making more eye contact whenever you can          talk to   friends family and then   strangers and write down          who usually broke eye contact first       what percentage of eye contact you had while they were talking        how much eye contact you had while you were talking        how you felt while eye contact was being maintained        what changed when you went from talking to friends to talking to strangers       think back to the last person you talked to since you did the last challenge   youll most likely find that you dont hold eye contact enough and likely even less when speaking   holding eye contact while speaking is more challenging than just listening so dont be hard on yourself   theres a fantastic question you can ask yourself in order to evaluate your eye contact        out of the   strangers you spoke to ask yourself this         what colour were their eyes        unless you were crazy observant you probably have no idea          challenge    go out and do this challenge again and this time make a conscious action to remember their eye colour        now that youre paying more attention and looking people deeper in the eye enough to see their eye colour  youre going to start wanting to aim the sweet spot   dont worry about which eye to focus on and dont shift back and forth stressing yourself out   pick one eye and stick to it   youll want to look deep enough in their eye that you can actually end up seeing your reflection   while you  re going to make a conscious effort to see these two visual cues  youll eventually want to be noticing them naturally where they barely register in your mind          when to break eye contact        the rule is that if someone is speaking you should be holding strong eye contact     similar to body language youre going to want to mirror their eye contact in order to build comfort as well as not appear crazy   hold eye contact while someone is talking to you until they break eye contact first   once they do  look away in a similar manner like they did in the same direction and then meet their eyes again once they look back at you  youll notice in your peripheral vision when they tilt their head back to you and then its game on again  following this rule is important because when they break eye contact they can also still see you in their peripheral vision and you dont want to come across as a psychopath staring them down   remember that proper eye contact is strong  confident and trustworthy   bad eye contact is either overly confrontational or riddled with insecurity and untrustworthiness          many liars refuse to look people in the eye or they try way too hard to never break eye contact ever adamant on selling their lie   the people in the first camp are filled with shame while they lie and cant bear to look you in eye while they lie   the latter are so over the top desperately trying to pass their lie off by staring you down like a psychopath   even if you are telling the truth you want to learn good eye contact so you dont accidentally get misplaced into one of those two categories   proper relaxed eye contact will naturally come off as warm  genuine and trustworthy   bill clinton is a prime example of near perfect warm and genuine eye contact   watch some of his speeches or videos that talk specifically about his eye contact   as a general rule  dont worry about which eye to look at when trying to hold eye contact  just pick one eye and stick with it  shifting your eyes makes you look shifty         challenge     hold eye contact and then break it when they do while mirroring where they look   once they look back you reestablish your strong eye contact   this skill is a must do in every interaction          challenge    watch videos on bill clintons eye contact      now comes the hard part and thats holding eye contact while you talk to people   this is something that many people find much harder to do than simply sit there and look at someone while they listen   actively talking and thinking about what youre saying and holding eye contact is much harder espescially if you still struggle with running out of things to say   refer back to the mirror challenge earlier if youre still struggling with this   if you cant have a   minute long interrupted rant about your morning with the mirror you still have more work to do          challenge     start holding eye contact as you speak to people   if you find it hard  start small and aim for one sentence at a time    then try to go for two   remember the look away rule as to not come across as a sociopath            bonus eye contact challenge    on your normal walk to work or as you walk through a mall  try to make eye contact with anyone you walk by and hold it until they break it or you walk out of their vision   this will seem scary and uncomfortable at first   if this is absolutely too hard for you  try with safe targets such as seniors as you walk by them and then level up as you get more practice   do be smart about your geographical location   dont try this in bad neighbourhood or on the   foot tall guy with prison tattoos in a back ally at night        turn it into a game and give yourself a point for each person you successfully hold eye contact with    youll find that most people wont even try to make eye contact with you   the ones that do will instantly dart their eyes away   the ones that can give you the rush are the people who start holding longer than a second   youll learn that the majority of people out struggle with eye contact and with just a bit of work each day you can have an edge over the average population        not looking someone in the eye during a hand shake is a first impression killer   even if you feel intimidated by them such as meeting a girlfriends father or a new boss  force yourself to push through and hold it like your life depends on it   people will notice and genuinely be impressed because so few people will dare hold eye contact with them   the same thing goes for having a weak hand shake  firmly grasp their hand like youre holding onto a pole but dont crush it   the web between your index finger and your thumb should be touching theirs          challenge     next time you meet five new people  make a conscious effort to hold eye contact as you shake their hand and youre exchanging names   dont worry if you fail to maintain it  as long as you make the attempt          enlist a friend    get a friend  set a five minute timer and start having a conversation about your weekly experiences   you should be going back and forth naturally   the catch is that youre never allowed to break eye contact first and your friend is going to call you on it   youre going to follow the look away rule   you must hold eye contact until your friend breaks it    dont turn this into a staring contest  your goal is to have a proper conversation and have your friend naturally break it   your goal will be to have a five minute conversation about what you both did during your week        eye contact can be scary but its such a powerful tool that needs constant practice   being able to hold steady eye contact as you speak can pay off greatly in terms of how genuine you are and how confident you come across as   if youre in a job interview and youre staring at the floor while you answers questions youre going to kill any chance you have at that interview   if you cant hold eye contact with your future boss with confidence then theyll have no confidence in you serving their company   if you dont have any confidence in yourself while speaking no one else will either   theres no choice but to develop effective eye contact      ,0
i am becoming more introverted the older i get  hello guys   first post for me on here  im    years old  im married  have   kids  own a home  a car  looking at my life from the outside its what some consider ideal  maybe not for a    year old  but you get the jist        in highschool  i was semi popular  did well in athletics  did well with girls  i always spent time hanging out with a friend  i was almost never alone  now  in my adult life  that has completely changed  im stuck in some weird limbo where everyone my age are living lives that a    year old would typically live  most are single  or in a newer relationship  most of them go bar hopping often  spend time with the boys  have poker nights  etc  i have tried reaching out to my old friends and i find myself just zoning out  i find their conversations unbearable  i really just have an awful time  every time  its not like theyve changed  im the one who changed       on the flipside  my wife is     she works in the medical field and often has dinners and social outings  these outings consist of people i would consider  similar  to me based on social  marital  and paternal status  after several of these dinner parties  im realizing that the whole thing ends up being a pissing contest  these people joke and laugh but its all so fake  they have no real interests  they talk about their things  and thats it  im not sure if its because its a  formal  setting and thats why  my wife insists that im looking into it too hard and i just need to relax  i just dont find anyone interesting anymore  i do live in a small town  so there arent many options for friends  currently  i am working on a plan to relocate my family to portland  for employment reasons  and i want to think this will create opportunities to make friends  im just afraid that my social skills are deteriorating       i feel like im stuck in this social limbo where i dont really fit in with anyone  being someone who has never had problems with being social  this is really messing with my head  how do i fit in  are there other people who feel this way  is this just what adult life is and i need to just fake it till i make it        x   b     x   b  ,0
want to start a conversation  but don t know what to say  pay the person a compliment  i did this    times in    days  heres what i learned  last summer i did a social experiment for my blog in which i talked to    strangers in    days the project was really fun for me and extremely  well received on this board    http   www reddit com r socialskills comments  hv ut former shy here i recently did a   day social    this june i decided to do something similar  and challenged myself to compliment three people  friends  co workers  family  and of course strangers  a day for the entire month        edit    here is the data sheet i kept detailing every compliment  http   andrewelsass com wp content uploads           compliments data pdf      edit      here  http   andrewelsass com    compliments in    days experiment revealed   are the rules i laid out for myself     edit     my first gold  love you guys      here  what i learned           the compliment is the ultimate conversation starter   according to the data i kept      of the time the compliment resulted in a conversation  when it didnt  it was usually because the compliment was in passing    if there were ever such a thing as a foolproof conversation starter  i think the compliment just might be it     it gives some sort of   direction   to a new conversation want to talk to someone nearby but can t think of anything to say  find something to compliment them on    it lets the other person talk about themselves without the outright directness and pressure of the standard  interview questions   e g   where are you from  what do you do     and as we know    everyone s favorite subject is themselves      encourages   exiting the headspace   and being much more observant of the world around you  getting good at observing the features and behaviors of other people then extends on to everything else in your environment  this ensures that you ll just about never run out of things to talk about      theyre mutually beneficial    compliments make people feel good  and people gravitate toward  and like talking to  those that make them feel good         more personal the compliment stronger the emotional response    merely by coincidence  no one knew the details of the experiment as i was conducting it   while doing this project i  received  three awesome compliments that impacted me in a big way for one reason or another  these re lit my passion toward the experiment and served as a reminder of why i decided to do it in the first place    one in particular was a text from a friend that i woke up to randomly one morning  it was detailed  reasonably long for a text  hit on several traits i value about myself  including some things i didnt know i valued about myself at the time   and was extremely out of the blue  this was about a month ago now  and i still think about and look at it again and again    the feeling that last one gave me made everything i had been complimenting people on seem trivial  my biggest regret with the project was not paying more of these deeper  more personal compliments  there have been compliments given over the past few years about my writing that i still revisit whenever self doubt creeps in   the staying power of a good compliment is seemingly limitless      this would be a hard thing to measure  but it seems that the more personal and specific the compliment  the more powerful the emotional response  i think it also holds true that the   more personal the compliment  the harder it is to give    i think everyone knows how powerful praise  and conversely  criticism  can be  yet it s just so easy to forget          cashiers are money    this project reaffirmed that cashiers are  the  absolute best resource for someone wanting to improve their social skills      they are a captive audience    they can t really be rude to you    most are going to appreciate having someone talk to them or do anything to break them out of their   how are you  did you find everything you need  paper or plastic    routine    even if you  crash and burn   it s      guaranteed they have had more awkward interactions in the checkout line  typically the only time someone will say something other than debit or credit to a cashier is if they have a complaint  i know from my time working in food service that the smallest compliment or deviation from the standard routine can make someone s day         people are comfortable with praise    when i was younger  giving a compliment made me feel like i was possibly putting some sort of unwanted attention or pressure on the other person    call it hyper humility  but i genuinely didnt know what to do with the attention when  i  was given a compliment  or how to accept one graciously i either mumbled thanks and buried my eyes to the ground or i over accepted and just generally looked like a douche by basking and letting it go to my head    so i had my preconceptions about what people s response patterns would be like and they were   completely blown away    maybe it s just a standard thing that happens in adulthood  but i can t think of one instance  discounting the children i complimented  where the person didnt receive the compliment graciously or where it seismically inflated their ego  that i could tell  anyway   in hindsight it seems like a silly thing to have worried about         it s a skill    its incredibly easy to cruise through life on autopilot and assume everyone knows everything they could possibly be complimented on but obviously thats not the point of a compliment    unless you are one of the lucky people that grew up with a very social disposition  getting comfortable with giving good compliments is something that requires   conscious action and deliberate effort      great compliments are genuine and often spontaneous  these two arent mutually exclusive  the more comfortable one gets with spontaneously dishing a compliment  the more genuine it will feel to the receiver  and that comfort level grows simply from   repetition  practice  and staying present    if there is a fear of having an awkward interaction as a result of giving a compliment      of the time that only happens because the compliment didnt feel genuine to the other person    finally  getting good at giving compliments can require a complete mindset shift  for people that go about life with a critical and or negative mindset  i used to be still sometimes am one of them   this could be the hardest part  however  learning to focus on the good in others is well worth it  for reasons beyond completing a complement challenge     tl dr  compliments are a great way to start a conversation  being extremely specific with a compliment can impact someone in a big way  cashiers are the best  social batting practice   people generally don t make receiving a compliment  weird   it s something that requires practice   ,0
i experienced adult bullying from another student on a university abroad trip and i m having trouble getting over it  i go to uni to learn and go home now  i attended a university trip to london for spring break  this was already a pretty bold move considering i m pretty introverted but i wanted to do something socially with my school at least once and my husband thought i should too    my assigned roommate and i hit it off immediately and she was super sweet and seemed to like me  we met for coffee a few times and i told her it was going to be my first time flying so i d need help learning the process of getting around an airport and what not  she seemed totally fine with this as she had flown a lot  we texted each other multiple times over the course of a few weeks planning what we d do together in london  we also hung out in the airports during layovers    fast forward to landing in london and her mood immediately changes towards me  we were all pretty exhausted from the flight but personally i was too excited to let it bother me  we go find a cafe in london and we re talking about random  innocent things and she just gets more and more annoyed with me  i asked what s wrong and she said i seemed mad  but i wasn t at all  i m not sure if i came off as annoyed  but i was trying to reassure her that i was actually really happy    we start walking back to our group and she just starts going off on me  telling me how i annoyed her during the time in the airport  and how clueless i was  even though i told her i didn t know crap about flights or airport protocol   this really really shocked me and i barely said anything  i was just looking at the ground walking with her while she called me childish  annoying  etc  then it started morphing into  you re the only one who has data here  you re scrolling on instagram  which is fine  but i m going to have to depend on you for a gps and i don t like that  i like being in control  idk  the whole thing was just bizarre  i start crying because i was watching my trip slowly begin to crumble  i was in a new place with complete strangers  and the one person i had gotten close to now saw me as a nuisance but none of her arguments made any sense  my head was spinning    she got upset with me a few more times during the trip  i had to tell our profs to switch our rooms  for the rest of the trip she gossiped about me  and isolated me from the rest of the females  i couldn t believe this was happening  middle school all over again    my anxiety levels were through the roof and honestly i haven t been able to let go what happened  i still try to figure out what went wrong  sadly  i have to be around this person twice per week because we have a class together  we don t look at each other or speak  but sometimes i get the urge to confront her and ask her why she felt like she had to ruin my first abroad trip for me  but that would do nothing  i just have hate inside of me for this person  i want revenge but i know that isn t the way to get past my pain  i ve told myself to forgive her  but i can t  i m pretty antisocial now and my anxiety issues have actually worsened  ,0
the best motherfucking day of my life i woke up after reading stories about some of yall asking out your girlfriends and going to parties and bars and shit  and that night i just felt a fucking  surge   of something  i just felt good about myself   so i wake up  put on my absolute best clothes  my good ass looking jacket since it was cold  and brush my fucking teeth  and lightly spray some adidas cologne i got for my birthday  and get some dryer sheets and dab them on my chest    do that shit    it smells fucking  good    i fix up my hair like i usually do and get all my shit and go to the bus stop  i get on the bus looking all cheery and shit  just active  instead of the usual sleepy squinted eyes i always get  already people are looking at me  this guy whos friends with pretty much everyone on there asks me what happened for me to be this   happy  and i could not answer  i just fucking  was    i go to school and wait for the first period bell to ring  instead of pretending to take a shit in the bathroom stall and playing tetris on my phone like i usually do  i go talk to some of my friends  i just acquired speaking skills somefuckinghow because i was talking to  everyone   then the bell rings and i go to first period    my seat is next to a girl i like  shes a cheerleader  but thats not saying i couldnt get her though  i talked to her a bit before and were friends i guess  before class officially starts and before everyone there fills up the room  ridding our semi privacy  i ask her to talk after school  then we do our usual talking shit  the rest of the school day goes normally  except for my motherfucking fire  i was happy and smiling and talking    so  after school  i meet her after school in the front area where the cars pick us up  away from everyone  basically  i told her i liked her and asked her out     and she said yes  she said it  she said the shit out of the word yes  she fucking said yes         i go home  get some weed and invite a couple people to my house  including her  we just chill  eating chips  with her head leaning against me  this was the first time i ever had multiple people at my house  let alone have a fucking girl come  probably the weed lured them  but i am not complaining  at all   we had to stop at   because thats when my parents came back from work  but the rest of the day i stayed home  smiling  my mom asked me why i was so happy  i told her i got a girlfriend  she was happy  everyone was happy    holy fuck  ,0
i still have social anxiety  but i m still a badass  i ve worked on myself while still having a job   here s what i learnt  everything i write here is free and i am too lazy to make any websites and have no social media besides reddit  so please enjoy     i grew up in an abusive home  i have asian immigrant parents and grew up in a predominately caucasian affluent area  while my family was not    my mother essentially only spoke mandarin and that was my first language   english was my second  learned while in kindergarten  it sucked lol    point is  i grew up in many factors that have permanently shaped part of how i behave and see people   because i was abused  i get really insecure as i grow closer to people  but  in spite of this i have worked very hard to get to the point where i can easily walk up to people  that seem open to conversation  and strike up a conversation   i also have had many people ask for my number with me having no intention of anything   so  i would say i may have some wisdom    imo improving social skills through rules can only get you so far   i feel that your social skills are inherently dependent on a couple things  your overall well being  how much you like to learn  and the people you surround yourself with  and thus what information you passively take in    these all influence your social skills in varying amounts of course  what areas you may need to work will be unique to your situation   i will lay out the three categories in more detail and suggest you to review these areas and see where your energy can be placed  we don t have like    months to just travel the world      wellbeing and health    this area is the easiest to change   start here  immanuel kant  a philosopher  suggested that we all have a categorical imperative  something we should always strive to do    this was that we should always use our consciousness and work from within  as our relationship with our mind is really the only thing we have true control over   this of course is really really paraphrased and i just woke up   i took that idea to heart and started working on almost every facet of my life  seriously   since this is r socialskills i will try to keep this section tight  as it is somewhat off topic    i  and you should  work on  fixing your diet  start meditating  review past traumas  start to journal  exercise  fix sleep schedule  see if you have any disorders   these are the core things that i personally believe you should do before bothering with excelling at socializing   i would start with cutting out soda  juice  and junk food   if that sounds hard i m sure there is a subreddit for those things  read the sidebars  where all the info is usually    i would start meditating  one   minute each morning  therefor you have literally no reason to not do so   move up to   when you want to   start to journal  just write whatever you want   write how someone made you feel today  what you didn t like or liked  how you are feeling etc  there is no right way to use a journal   after taking some tests i realized i was gluten intolerant and had sleep apnea  i fixed these and a tremendous amount of my anxiety went away   scary part is people acclimate to these things and feel normal until you really check for no reason      like to learn    socializing is extremely complex  but  if i had to boil it down to some things i would say it is  a desire to learn about people  the desire to learn about other things  as to be a wealth of knowledge   understanding social rhythm  will get into that    understanding social boundaries  will also get into that later   and practicing your values    back to learning  i will be keeping this section short as everyone is so different regarding this   the key point is that socializing requires you to enjoy learning about people   but  not all people have this desire  so sometimes enjoying doing other things a lot  and then exchanging dialogue about said topics  is another way to learn about people   you two are trading info on your passions and not your emotional states   you can like to learn about  their background  their current place in life  general city they live in and thus the culture that surrounds them   then as things progress you may like to learn about  their hobbies  their aspirations  preferences on food  music  movies  sports  art  culture  a bit about their family etc   through this you will have a picture of this person and a wealth of knowledge to dip back into for conversations   think of it as both a roadmap and places to visit with them again   conversation died  remeber that they talked about loving their summer hike  just start a new conversation and ask them about why they liked it  why they like hiking  maybe even how they go about it   the whys and hows are powerful tools to learn about people   just don t become a box of infinite questions with no commentary   this is a two way street     people around us    this section can be infinitely long and is the hardest of the three to change and work on   this doesn t mean you shouldn t   the people you surround yourself with tremendously impact your  way of thinking  understanding of social cues  habits and values  general happiness  goals in life   i literally changed most of my social circle   i reviewed the people that i surrounded with and split them into three categories  people that do not respect me  good friends that i respect and have good social skills  my core group of friends that understand me  have good social skills  and help me want to grow   i then tried to hang out with the people that didnt respect me and review in person before making any decisions  once i did i just started to contact them less and realized they did not contact me back either   no worries   i then focused my attention on my core group  or what i call my home base   i see my social sphere as a field that i can traverse  the more energy and confidence i have at the moment  the further into the unknown i will feel safe to explore  aka talk to and befriend strangers   when things in my life are not going well i know i have established deep bonds with my core group to find emotional shelter   there is no need to always feel the need to talk to strangers for confidence   if you feel you do not have a lot of friends  focus back onto your personal wellbeing   with time you will see results and probably realize you   had   friends that were good to you all along but preferred to hang with unhealthy friends      final topics    learn about social rhythm  something talked about in social psychology    i really enjoyed the social animal as it was rather easy to read   the self help books did not translate into daily life as easily  but  in short  social rhythm are all the non verbal cues we give off   the next time you can watch people talk  start making a note at when someone starts or stops talking and when the trade to someone else talking is made     practice just observing this    you will start to pick up that there is a rhythm in how the conversation flows   that s why with some people it feels awkward as the rhythm could feel disjointed and bumpy  while with others it can feel euphoric as the conversation flows so well and naturally   just observing this in your daily life will translate into your social life   learn about social boundaries   a basic intro is that you have internal and external boundaries   learning a bit about boundaries will help you tremendously in all facets of your life   internal boundaries are what you decide to let in  external are how you decide to reach out   think of it like a body of armor with a door on it  which you wear    you decide what you let in  close the door if you think someone is mistreating you   external boundaries is like a forcefield that can change shapes   you choose how you want to shape it and how much energy and info you want to share outwards   no one will practice this well       so just know that it is about picking up social cues and always recalibrating     conclusion    social skills are deeply rooted in how we see ourselves  the people we surround ourselves with  and how we grow in our everyday lives   i suggest people that are struggling the most to focus the most on themselves  and not the other way around    slowly then move into hobbies and learning about people   see the rhythm in conversations  learn about social boundaries   then start to move in the direction of shaping your social field and who you surround yourself with     finally  social skills are not something you learn and keep forever   you must constantly work on them to maintain them   this is why all three of those categories should be managed  as if one dips too much it can start to cascade into the others   i hope this helped some people and was not too far off topic  ,0
no one is keeping a continuity tab on you one theme i see in many posts is this sub is that people seem to think they cant change because thats not who they really are and other people might find it weird  not believe them  call them out  i think thats overestimating how much people keep track on each other  if you change super suddenly people might get a bit confused at first but theyll soon adjust  people change all the time   ,0
asked a girl for coffee  replied two days later but said yeah    good or bad  note  amazed at how so many strangers can support me like this  thanks everyone    ,0
what if that that super shy coworker suddently became more sociable  so ive been working for this company for   years  in these   years  pretty much everyone has realised by now that im extremely shy  awkward and avoidant  i have never dared go into the common room or near the coffee machine because im so incredibly uncomfortable around people    now i got to the point where i decided to change that and im in therapy  but im feeling awfully lonely  my therapist thinks it would be important to try and start showing up in common areas more often  but i cant stop worrying about what people would think  they even make jokes and sly comments about me never leaving my desk  how would they react if i started showing up at lunch out of the blue  how should i react to the jokes surprised looks if i do  ,0
does anyone else get extremely pissed off due to no socialization for some time  ive noticed that whenver i dont socialize with people  whether online or physical  i tend to get so upset and think that no one cares about me  no one likes me  no one wants to take the time out of their day to actually talk to me  when i actually talk to someone though  all those bad feelings just go away almost instantly  its like im just refreshed of all the bad feelings for some time  just wanted to know if anyone relates   ,0
does anyone else feel a lot of shame when socialising  when i say shame  i mean shame about the self for not being good enough because ive been an awkward loser for a large part of my adolescence and still feel like one as an adult    i feel desperate when i talk to people because of how badly i want friends  but i also want to seek them organically and not feel like some thirsty  people pleasing  servile rat because im deathly afraid of rejection at the same time    i often dont pursue people now because of how uncool and pathetic i feel i am next to them  as someone with no achievements and no interesting redeeming quality to show  when i speak i can feel myself clamouring to impress them with talk about how i want to do x and y to sound driven and normal  to fit in  but its insincere to myself and i hate it   i cant be myself when i talk to people or try to befriend them  because i just feel like such a loser and im scared of them finding out  and making fun of me   bringing my fears to life  it sounds absurd and a little silly  but this fear is ruining my life and traps me in a deep loneliness and depression    i want to know people  and be known  but the horror of having my weaknesses discovered is debilitating  ,0
your conversations will instantly improve when you help other people see you more clearly a girl i knew in college pulled me aside one evening and asked why i never really talked about myself  she was disappointed that she had hung out with me on numerous occasions over the years in our mutual group of friends  yet hardly knew anything about me  her comment taught me a valuable lesson     have you ever noticed how some people are easier to shop for than others  why is that  what present would someone think of buying you for your birthday  people with strong personalities who reveal a lot of information about themselves are easy to shop for  revealing tidbits of information about yourself over time is how you paint a colorful picture of your character  shy people  who keep their thoughts and personalities hidden  are more difficult to shop for  that s why they end up receiving generic gifts like sweaters  candles  and bath products every year for christmas   remember  the first time someone meets you  they only see a blurry image of you  they don t know much about you  your goal is clarity  help them see you better   the more context someone has   the more they ll get out of every piece of information you offer   the more someone knows about you  the more comfortable they become speaking with you and the easier conversation becomes for them as well  others can more confidently reference or introduce certain topics because they can infer how you would feel about those topics   help put people at ease and get rid of your cloak of mystery and the invisible barriers that exist between you and others  conversation will flow more easily when your conversation partner knows more about you   there have been studies indicating that the sheer act of disclosing something about yourself causes others to like you more even if they have little interest in what you re saying  disclosing to a degree that s appropriate can build and strengthen relationships    too much too soon and you could scare someone away    if you re not sharing  don t expect others to share either   and it s not necessary to shine a giant spotlight on yourself in order to self  disclose  learn to  sneak  in personal information  great conversationalists are savvy at sneaking some personal information into the context of other phrases  in the sentences below  notice the     bol    d parts where the personal tidbit is snuck into the larger comment     that s such a great sweater     i love turquoise     i don t see enough clothes with turquoise       really      i m not a car guy       but that doesn t sound right to me        i can t believe he didn t like the xyz movie      i like pretty much anything by john smith       maybe he should watch it again        i didn t even notice it     and you know i m picky about hair     if i didn t notice it  then i don t think anyone else did     edit  tons of people are asking me for more tips    ill add a link  here  https   www socialupgrader com   at the risk of this post being deleted soon by the mods  ,0
find a compliment for every person you meet so to get rid of my negative outlook on this world i started to think of a compliment for every person i see and its actually pretty helpful  sometimes i will tell them the compliment mostly i am just thinking it  have fun and find the sunshine in this world ,0
how to never run out of things to say in conversation  ,0
we all want to be more social so remember this      focus less on them  accepting you  and what  you  want and more about enjoying the interaction      speak the fuck up  if you sound shy scared or as though you are lacking in confidence then thats the vibe you will give off  i m not saying be loud  just speak up      handshakes  high fives  hugs  games and mild teasing are all ok  its sometimes in your best interest to be playful  you dont have to stand there like a freaking statue or sit like you re in class      don t be scared  remember that humans are social creatures and most people would like to meet new and interesting people to become friends with and build relationships with      we are all struggling  never forget this  youre not the only one who doesnt know what to say or  who is shy about speaking to people  in truth most people wish others would initiate       remove the idea from your head that an interaction could go horribly  its highly unlikely anyone will just be flat out rude to you  call you disgusting and tell you to leave  it just doesnt happen often enough for it to be a concern  and if it does that person probably has some issues they need to work out with themselves       remember that like all things  developing a friendship  relationship or any kind of connection is going to take time  it may take a few conversations and hangouts before some people loosen up and really show you who they are      people have lives and so dont take it personally if you never see or hear from someone again that you were interested in getting to know    it s tough i know but little by little and step by step we can all get better  ,0
without sports  alcohol or religion  moving through life is a contant reminder of your outsider status while these things are utterly trivial and delusional to me  they create human bonds and that is the really important thing  yet i wont lie to myself  i wont watch sports just to fit in  or drink  or praise someone or other   i feel like i am sentenced to live on the fringes of society forever and i dont know if i can take that   yes i can join an alpaca sweater knitting club for harry potter fans but joining some niche interest will in fact only reinforce my outsider status    i have tried many clubs and groups and such but the human condition is mostly the same  bonding over delusion and madness    edit  under different circumstances i would try and bridge the gap  letting you know that i  in fact  judge no one as harshly as i do myself  but the amount of pejoratives directed towards my person suggests something else that has been a wider theme of my life  namely the bullying and harrassment i have received when letting my true thoughts known and trying to reach out  at least it has let me know that wherever i may have been schooled  a similar thing would have probably happened to me   edit    to come   ,0
why don t i feel immediate sympathy when i hear bad news  i have a delayed reaction when someone tells me their bad news  it happened twice so far this week  first  it was when my coworker said her cat died over the weekend  i said  oh   that s it    then  today  a customer at work said his wife passed away last week  i said  aww no    both times i was left somewhat speechless  it s not til hours later that i realize i should have said more  like the typical  i m sorry for your loss  or  i ll keep you in my prayers   what s wrong with me  ,0
the   best starting points for improving your social skills are eye contact  smiling laughing  and enjoying people like books  hey everyone  this is my favorite subreddit  as i have been working hard to improve my social skills in the last year or so  out of all the advice i have read and implemented  i wanted to make a post that consolidates it all into the   things i think are most important  these   things have helped me the most  and i think if you are starting from ground zero with your social skills  you should work on these   things in the order i have written them here      nbsp      step    get your eye contact game perfected    it was a huge realization for me when i noticed that every person in my life that i have ever perceived to have  good social skills  made close to      eye contact with the people they were talking with  i also realized that i was probably making eye contact about    of the time  if you do not make good eye contact  it should be the   first   thing you fix about yourself  there is nothing charming about poor eye contact  it is very difficult to be a warm  charming person without making eye contact  it took me some time to implement this habit  and if you are starting from the bottom  it will take you some time too  every time you are walking up to another person  no matter who they are  think to yourself  ok  im about to begin a conversation  i am going to look into their eyes starting now  and not look away until the conversation is over    now i know a lot of eye contact guides give numbers like  make eye contact     of the time and look away     of the time   i say do not worry about fine tuning how much eye contact you make when you are just starting out  shoot for      eye contact right out of the gate  and when you finally make it a habit  then you can try to fine tune how often you glance away  a lot of  sociable normiez  tend to glance away occasionally  nobody actually makes eye contact      of the time  but i think it is good to shoot for      when trying to build the habit  extra tip   do not look at people all bug eyed   https   shawglobalnews files wordpress com                  jpg quality    strip all w     h     crop    i noticed i was doing this when i started working on my eye contact  it was kinda involuntary because i was nervous making eye contact  because i was very new to it  try to keep your eyes relaxed     nbsp     step    smile and laugh    there is no well loved person who does not smile and laugh  when you see someone you know  first hit em with those fresh eye contact skills  and when youre locking into that conversation  hit em with a smile that lets them know youre happy to see them and ready to have a conversation    i used to hardly smile  i would greet people with a  hey whats up dude  and not smile  what the fuck was i thinking  why would i not smile  if you are genuinely having an awful day  sure you can skip the smile  but on the average day  fuck it dog give every homeboy homegirl homeperson that crosses your path a little smile  that  hey whats up dude  that i used to do got about a    times better reaction when i finally started smiling when i said it  when i used to hit people with a deadpan  hey whats up dude  they hit me with a deadpan  oh hey carcharodoncarchari whats up   and then my stupid ass would think they didnt like me because they did not seem happy to see me  well when i wasnt smiling they thought i wasnt happy to see them  then when i switched to a smiling  hey whats up dude   i started getting people lighting up and saying  aw shit carcharodoncarchari whats good   every conversation is headed in the right direction when you start smiling   now onto the subject of laughing  do it more  now dont force out some fake cackling  i am just talking about a nice wholesome  chortle  https   www youtube com watch v pzu gpds     when someone makes a joke  i swear sometimes laughing can kick start a perpetual laughter engine  early in a conversation you let out a little chortle at someones funny story  laughing is contagious so that gets others loosened up  once loosened you laugh a little more heavily at the next funny story  before you know it conversations can turn into hilarious riots if you let them  nothing bad can come from giggling a little more so just do it  once youve got eye contact down  bring in that smiling and laughing and you will start to realize you have the power to open people up  and what do you do once you have someone opened up  you read them like the magical book they are    nbsp     step    enjoying people like books    a lot of the time the expression   i can read you like a book   https   www youtube com watch v veeu  y ihg  has a negative connotation  i mean it in a different way here  remember that  sonder  https   www youtube com watch v akoml  fiv   thing  every person is like a whole freaking person  they have a backstory  if a    year old persons life was a tv show  there would have been like         episodes already  and some people have the audacity to call people boring  nobody is boring  everybody is deeply complex  this last tip is less about building a habit  and more about making a mindset change  you have to absolutely  lust  to learn more about people  you have to want to read peoples lives cover to cover and relish every second of it  if you do not care about other people  i think youre missing out   that valley girl at the bar sipping g ts parked on her phone  she probably liked the same obscure cartoons as you when she was a kid  the bartender  maybe he is getting married in a week  and the story of how he met his wife is one of the funniest stories youll ever hear  i used to have a huge problem with this concept  i used to think that i had to make sure i had cool interests and cool stories so that people would think i was cool  i would hi jack every conversation to spit out all of this information that i thought would make me cool  that was all wrong  just forget yourself  focus on the other side of the table  it is infinitely better  other people are books and you should read them   find out somebodys favorite album  listen to it before the next time you see them  for fucks sake do not be the kind of person that does not listen to it  next time you see them   hey jim  dude that brian eno album was tight as hell    that would blow jims mind  most people would not have actually listened to the album  jim would be elated that you took his recommendation  and now your huge mental book of who jim is has a few more pages because you understand an album that jim holds very close to his heart  ask people about their story  try to get the details filled in  laugh at the funny parts  sympathize with the sad parts  if you meet someone who doesnt like to share  no sweat  you could share a little  or you and that person could just dick around and not talk about yourselves at all  try to find out what makes that person laugh and just  dick around        tl dr   look people in the eye when they talk to you  and when you talk to them  smile and laugh and soak up everything that makes them who they are  try to not worship celebrities and movie franchises and political parties  instead worship all of your new friends  instead of checking reddit for new updates about a tv series  check in with friends for

how do you stay active in a conversation where you have no experience with and can t relate in any way  last night i had a family meeting and was talking with my older cousins  the conversation was going fine  but it suddenly changed from school experiences to clubbing  since i ve never been at a club i couldn t really contribute to the conversation in any way  i just kind of went quiet until the conversation changed again about    minutes later    does anyone have tips for situations like this  it s just awkward to wait until the conversation changes again  ,0
anti social to social  my story when i was    this girl i was talking to in highschool introduced me to this youtuber that went around doing random funny things to strangers  back when they werent scripted   at this point in my life i was extremely shy with a bunch of insecurities and it took me awhile to warm up to people   watching these youtube videos i seriously could not believe the amount of confidence this man had to be himself and instantly put a smile on peoples faces and build relationships off a simple interaction  this is where my desire to be social and confident began   then came a time around    years old where i realized that i had full control of my life  whats stopping me from losing some weight  whats stopping me from talking to people or expressing my feelings  how do i want to live the rest of my life    well i slooooowly started interacting with more people  just saying hi  asking questions etc  and i kept telling myself that nobody else cares about my insecurities like i do  everything i had control of eg  my weight at the time  i fixed it and thats all i can do  nobody is perfect    by the time i was in university i was still learning how to interact with people  i really wanted to be that guy that was able to talk to anyone   i read the classic book  how to win friends and influence people  which honestly felt like common sense but it was hard to apply at the beginning but then became natural   i went to school for marketing and professional sales and my head instructor always mentioned the importance of interpersonal skills  thats what he always said was so important and as time went on i started to realize why   years have gone by and after talking to my girlfriend about it today i came to realize how much i have changed and how long it actually took me which inspired me to write this post    i picked up and apply many social skills ive learned along the way  both verbal and non verbal  not only has this helped me in my personal life but also in my professional life as well  i was    when i got a job at the bank and my manager at the time told a big part of the reason why she gave me the job was because i was the only one that came to introduce themselves in person and not just apply online  it spoke a lot about my character  not only that but now i run my own marketing agency and my income depends quite a bit on my social skills    i am at a point now where i honestly feel confident talking to anyone and i can walk away with a small relationship built from a simple interaction  for example  just the other day i went into a camera shop with my brother to get a tripod  and we literally ended up talking for an hour and half with the guys there and we walked away with friends made  we all added each other on instagram and now i always pop into the store to say hi when im nearby    its moments like these that are crazy satisfying for me and make my heart happy because i know many years ago i dreamed of being like that   i guess with all this being said i just wanted to share my story and maybe motivate those of you that are still early in your journey   edit  grammar  on mobile and sleepy  ,0
the power of eye contact  my experiences since learning how to look someone in the eye   backstory    i have always found myself to be an easy target in social situations  ive never felt like ive had much respect from my friends or fellow classmates  i am a college sophomore   i came across the red pill subreddit  and was convinced that i was being treated this way because i was  beta   i was convinced that i fell into this role due to my height  and other physical traits  im an average height     male  lean athletic body type with slightly above average looks  most of my friends are around        and slightly more built  so i put the two together and thought this lack of respect came from the minor height difference between us  i started standing up straighter  looked into shoes like nike air and timberlands in order to appear an inch or so taller  i started lifting weights and trying to make myself as physically large as possible  i admit that i was absolutely loving that small boost in height  and i still do sometimes wear shoes that make me look taller  however  even when i was at eye level with my friends  nothing changed in my social interactions with them  i was still the person always picked on  i started convincing myself i just needed more respectful friends  and suddenly it dawned on me that maybe i was at least partially to blame     assessing my skills    a while back  i heard someone on the internet talk about the power of strong eye contact  tone of voice  and body language  this information stood out to me  so i decided to assess my skills in these three categories  i went out with friends that night and began to analyze my behavior throughout the night  i have a deep  well projected voice  i sang bass in high school choir  but when i started talking to my friends  i realized that i would never look them in the eye while talking for more than a second or two before breaking eye contact  i would fidget my hands around or stuff them in my pockets because i did not know what to do with them  as i was talking to my friends  they would be facing me  looking me in the eye  i would have my shoulders turned away from them  my hands in my pockets and my eyes on the floor  no one had ever pointed this out to me  and it wasnt until i actively assessed my skills when i realized that i looked majorly insecure all the time  even when i was talking about something i was very confident in  i thought  no wonder my friends always treat me like im beneath them  id feel the same way about them if they displayed the same body language      the experiment    i did a little research on eye contact and body language  and i found the concepts very easy to understand  so i decided to try them out  i hung out with one of my close male friends a few days later  he has always been a little condescending towards me  even in subjects where i know im better than him  he always presented himself in a more confident manor which made him seem better  we grabbed a couple beers at our local bar  and sat down at a table facing each other  as we talked  i tried to hold eye contact with him  it had no problem looking at him while he talked  but once i was ready to say something  i instantly started to feel a little nervous  i kept trying to break eye contact after a few seconds and stare into the distance for the rest of the time i was talking  i fought to maintain that eye contact for as i could  it still felt extremely unnatural  but as the alcohol loosened us up a bit  i progressively became a little more comfortable  to my surprise  he all of a sudden was treating me with much more respect than i have ever received from him before  he spoke in a way that made me feel more like were equals  and was noticeably less condescending     results    over the next couple months  i continued to research and practice body language  slowly  i became less intimidated by eye contact  i started learning to use hand gestures when i talked  i have felt much more confident and in control during social situations  people give me more attention  and have become much more engaged in my stories  the most interesting result of this experiment was seeing how my friends reacted  theyve always liked me  and liked hanging out with me  but for the first time in my life  ive felt like they respected me  some of my friends have even started looking up to me  for example  me and my friend are both musicians  hes definitely a good musician  but im much more skilled than him  however  he never really gave me the time of day when it came to talking about music  the more ive been able to engage with him about music using more confident body language  the more hes started to look up to me  he actually convinced me to help him learn to read and write sheet music for guitar  this is something he never would have done in the past  because my insecure body language made me seem much less skilled than him  in a few cases  ive even talked to friends and realized that they now struggle with maintaining eye contact with me much more than i do with them  it has completely altered the dynamics of those relationships     conclusion    i was shocked by my results  i had no idea that something so small as improving your body language could have such a drastic impact on my life and my relationships and friendships  i was always trying to earn peoples respect solely by achieving higher status   lifting weights  buying new clothes  trying to become better than other people at something  even buying shoes that made me appear a few centimeters taller  which i personally love  but theyre super unnecessary   all that hard work  but it took was addressing my awkward body language  i wish someone had told me sooner  i was born as a naturally shy  awkward  socially anxious guy  i still have a long way to go in improving my social skills  the results ive seen so far have been really encouraging  and its helping me gain the confidence needed to further improve my social skills  something that used to seem like an impossible goal seems very realistic  im looking forward to living a more confident  extroverted life  ,0
how do i overcome my insecurities perfectionism to have more genuine relationships conversations  f    ive recently started a new job at a café  the main image of this store is a friendly atmosphere  so that includes chatting with customers  regulars and getting to the staff because they see themselves as a family  i feel overloaded with the work and by the social obligations  i want to improve but i dont know how to come across  they are so open  honest and positive   ive been there a week  theyve already identified i lack confidence   i have no idea how i should act  i feel like im trying too hard to get accepted and valued that im stressing and being a bit clumsy   i keep thinking that i have to do things right everytime and remember everything  and know the regulars names  likes and interests   ive forgot how to take things easy   i keep trying to think of the right thing to say  basically being a people pleaser  ive done this so much in my life that i dont know how to be real and have fun  i feel bad about talking about myself and when i do do it comes across as if i need the reassurance from someone   my question is what steps can i take to improve  what should i focus on  ,0
i came to the realization that i only reach out to people when i want something from them  its not intended to be manipulative  i just only want to talk to people when theres a purpose  how do i change  i have to admit i find myself only reaching out to people when im lonely  need an answer to a question  etc  i have aspergers and i never realized that i was coming across as manipulative  fake etc  after somebody told me this recently   the truth is  i dont really care much for  shooting the shit  with other people  i dont seem to have that capability nor desire to do it  i dont mind talking to anyone  i consider myself pretty open minded and try my best to not be judgmental with people    but unless someone contacts me first the odds of me being the initiator is next to nothing  and when i do go to initiate conversations whether its online or in person  i always feel like im being shitty and manipulative   i only talk to people when theres a purpose  and i personally dont see any thing wrong with it  but i know its not good socially  ,0
all you really need is basic social skills  the rest is never your fault many people recently start becoming depressed   supposedly   due to lack of social skills because they have no friends or no relationship or no job  so they start blaming their social skills for this remember a simple thing     basic social skills allow you to get all of this without too many problems      it is very hard to remember it when we fail and dont see success in what we do   what are the basic social skills   simple        smile          maintain eye contact          laugh when you can          be interested in the person youre talking to          be friendly  curious and overall welcoming          be polite and abide by the manners     thats it   if something goes wrong when you do this  it is never your fault in about     of all cases  you need to get this stupid thought out of your head  remember this   edit     if you can do this once then you can do this an infinite amount of times       x   b  ,0
how to stop being boring  the f ck it philosophy  x post from  r zenhabits  let s say you re boring   maybe no one s ever told you that but you sometimes get a sinking feeling in your stomach that hints at it  or maybe someone has told you you re boring and it makes you feel like a worthless piece of        you want to be interesting and fun  but you re trapped in the prison of your limited social skills     but what makes you so boring   you do   the prison bars are made of your own negative beliefs and you can t seem to squeeze through them  if there s one thing you re good at it s tricking yourself into believing that you suck  how fun  though the fact that you did this to yourself is actually good news  you can turn it around     how you started being boring    once upon a time  when you were about   feet tall  you were all about fun  you were an explorer learning to navigate your world and nothing was off limits   you burnt your hand on the stove  it didn t stop you from playing with fire   then along came social rules and the idea that you were  supposed to  behave in certain ways in certain situations  you learned that there were consequences to your actions and doubt replaced abandon  the world became more complicated than it had previously seemed   take little pete for instance  at   feet little pete liked to run around the house naked playing cowboys and indians  screaming his lungs out  he didn t give a shit   at   feet little pete had his first crush  we ll call her lacey  their class was putting on a dance for the school and the teacher asked the boys to choose their partners   the problem was that lacey already had a boyfriend  or at least a boy she held hands with at lunchtime  the little turdburger    but when miss hudson told the girls that they had to say yes to the first boy who asked to be their dance partner little pete saw his opportunity  none of the other boys moved  little pete pounced  lacey said  no  but miss hudson sealed the deal   they danced together for the weeks that followed and  slowly but surely  he won lacey over  she told him she liked him   little pete didn t know what to do in this foreign scenario so every day he sent his best friend to ask lacey if she still liked him  that was the extent of his contact with lacey  she said yes for   days then changed her mind   little pete was devastated  he developed a fear of talking to girls which dragged on until he was      after a few more run ins with  the consequences of his actions  he stopped taking chances  he made his decisions based on what people would think of him  he agreed with opinions  he avoided stepping on toes  he suppressed his desires  he was good little boring boy   there was a time when you too used to act first  think later  not anymore  now you worry about all of the negative   far fetched possible outcomes that your mind can conjure up  and they re usually enough to convince you to be boring   it goes something like this in an uncertain situation     the boring process  codename  boring boris     trigger    i m not sure what to do       do i have to do something  or say something   no  do nothing  play it safe  yes  go to step        what should i do  option     what is the polite thing to do  option     what do i think is normal in this situation  option     what is the easiest  least scary  thing for me to do      choose an option and act   you ve run this process over and over again  you said no to your inner explorer  congratulations  you made yourself boring   but the good news is it s not you that s boring  it s the boring shit you choose to do that s boring  and all it takes to stop being boring is to do something different     why being boring makes you feel like crap    theres a problem with the boring boris process  we designed it to keep us safe and we feel safest when we use it  but we feel like crap afterwards   most people don t dislike us when we use boring boris because we put none of our self in our actions  hence there s nothing to dislike  they don t see us at all  we make ourselves easy to ignore     if i do the polite thing i make no connection    if i do what i think is normal i m not even copying a real person  i m copying a hypothetical average and turning myself into a characterless bore    if i do the easiest  least scary  thing i m hiding as much of my self as possible  only sharing what i have to  it s like taking out a hair clip when you lose at strip poker  boring   if you want people to actually like you you have to get naked  or at least show some skin   figuratively     give them something to like  put your self in your actions   yes  there s a risk in not being boring  some people might not like what they see when you stop hiding  but their disapproval means nothing when you find the people who do like you  those are the connections that will fuel you  being truly accepted for the weird monkey that you are inside is the greatest feeling in the world   it s a much bigger risk to be boring  you ll never make strong connections   imagine yourself in this situation  it s your first day at university  you re sitting in the lecture hall and you don t know anyone  imagine the speaker asks for a volunteer to stand up and tell the class something that you did in the past week as an ice breaker   did you get a physical reaction to that last sentence  lump in your throat  maybe  are you unsure what to say   most people in the class will go through a thought process that looks something like boring boris   trigger    i m not sure what to do    do i have to do something  or say something   no  do nothing  play it safe  hide   or if they re singled out they take the easy option  they share nothing risky about themselves   i don t know    i did lots of things this week  umm  i bought some textbooks    not felicity though   felicity used to play it safe but now shes the first to put her hand up  she s a risk taker  she doesn t mind looking foolish because she s learnt there s more to gain than there is to lose   you might like felicity or you might hate her  but would you say she s boring  read on and compare     the fun process  codename   fuck it  felicity     how do we put our self in our actions to become more fun  more interesting   we replace the  should  in boring boris with  want   we stop reacting and start creating  it looks like this   trigger    i m not sure what to do       what do i want to do  option     what experience do i want to create for myself  option     what gets me excited  option     what am i afraid of doing  that at least part of me wants to do      choose an option and act   felicity s heart is racing from what she s about to say  she s scared but she wants to connect  so she seizes this opportunity to share with the class  because fuck it    i levelled up my mage in world of warcraft and my guild is raiding a dungeon tonight  if anyone here plays wow come say hi    now everyone in the class knows something about  fuck it  felicity  they have something they can talk to her about  they might even feel a bit closer to her  she certainly didnt bore them   meanwhile no one knows anything about boring boris     stop being boring    becoming interesting can be scary at first  but you want it  do you know the combination of fear and desire that i m talking about  that s your green light  that s your brightly lit path away from boring   felicity didn t stop being boring because she was particularly interesting  she stopped being boring because she decided to  get naked   now she expresses her opinion  she steps on toes  she chases what she wants  and the funny thing is people love her for it  she s real   the next time you re unsure what to do in a given situation  try running  fuck it  felicity instead of boring boris  start small  make mistakes and learn from them     examples    a real estate agent told me he wants to build trust with his clients   im not an average agent  i care about them and getting their home  i want them to know im the best agent and they can trust me with one of the biggest investments of their lives   he tries to connect with his clients but the majority of the time they give him one word answers  the stress of trying to sell them a house gets in the way of connecting   boring boris would act the way he thinks a real estate agent  should  act in this situation  he d make polite small talk and tell the clients how spacious the bedroom is and how much light the living room gets because the windows face east  where the sun rises    fuck it  felicity might say  listen  before i show you some houses i want you to know that i actually care about you finding a home that makes you happy  some agents just want to offload as many houses as possible but i can t do that    i d feel too guilty if i forced something on you  plus i m a terrible liar  so i actually want to know what you like and what you don t like  if you promise to tell me  i ll promise to not pretend a crappy house is great for you    someone else i know has trouble connecting with people because hes too eager to connect  he says he has a weird personality and sense of humour so he resorts to polite conversation to play it safe  meaning he s essentially running the boring boris process  his conversations look like this   him  hey  how are you  them  good  how about yourself  him  pretty good  him  in his head    okay whats next    awkward silence  him  gloomy weather  eh  or what d you have for lunch    fuck it  felicity would make it personal  she might read the other person s body language and say  hey  you look  happy focused full of energy excited chilled etc    what s happening    even if you read them wrong they ll appreciate that you ve taken the time to notice them  and now you can talk about what s really going on  instead of the weather  try to avoid making negative observations like sad  tired  sick  etc  because it can make them self conscious  you could put a more positive spin on it with something like  you look like you ve been working hard   or  you look like you re deep in thought    if they seem like they don t want to talk  because sometimes we all don t  you can follow it with  anyway  you look like you re on your way somewhere   or  you look like you re really busy   they ll appreciate you giving them an easy out and will remember how socially aware you are next time   someone else i know rarely shares things about himself because he feels like he s too boring or not good enough for his friends  he talks to his friends about football  wrestling and topics he thinks they want to talk about  because they re easy  he judges himself based on how interested they are in what he says  yet he puts no self in what he says  textbook boring boris   if you re scared to share something because you think  it s too boring   you re probably wrong  most things that are scary to share are actually rather interesting  people have similar fears  they can relate   when you share things that scare you people recognise that you ve trusted them enough to share something scary  they admire that you ve taken a risk for the benefit of connecting with them  you stop being boring  you become real   that s why when  fuck it  felicity feels like she s too boring she might say to her friends  hey guys  how do you always come up with interesting things to say  sometimes i think i m a bit boring   because she s real  be real   boring boris  fears come from low self esteem or insecurity  we all have them to some degree  applying  fuck it  felicity s approach can help you change not just your outcomes  but also the root of the problem over time   now go get back in touch with your inner

success story  i am buzzing with confidence now hey everyone  i just wanted to share my story here to offer some encouragement to others   i am a    year old ex introvert shy nerdy aspie guy    years ago  i started university and i was always in my head  so much so that i would avoid grocery stores that didnt have self checkouts to avoid human interaction   to be fair to my old self  a lot of my anxieties were down to narcissistic parental abuse  past mockery  fat shaming  and harsh rejections  the first girl i asked out called me  gross     after my first two years  i took a gap year  moved to a new city  working an internship  out of school  this was the first time in my life that i had time to pursue hobbies that werent related to school academics   i made two of the greatest decisions of my life     i got a dog    i joined improv  given how cute my dog is  she is a great conversation starter with random people on the sidewalk or at the park  naturally  i started meeting a lot of people and just gained this quality of saying hi to random passers by   improv to me was far more therapeutic than years of therapy  it helped me not care  think too much about consequences of everything i do   when i was in high school  the first time i attempted public speaking  i botched it and got laughed at  i was so embarrassed that i never did anything like it again  now  with my background in comedy  if i made a mistake in public  id be the first one laughing at it tbh   within that one gap year  i truly got to explore myself  made the best friends of my life  got asked out and dated a few people  performed improvised  unscripted shows in front of live audiences at cafes  theaters  on my last day  after i performed my last show in the city  tens of my friends came to see me off at the bus station as i left for school  i never felt more valued in my life  this week  im back at university  the difference is immense  i am enjoying every party  pursuing every opportunity to socialize  i asked out   girls this week which is notably   more than how many i pursued during my first   years at university   unfortunately  one was visiting a friend for the weekend and the other is a lesbian  no regrets whatsoever  literally nothing can go wrong the way i used to make it up in my head  and if it does  ill improvise     tldr  turned into a social magnet from a complete loner always in my head      feel free to ask any questions  ,0
i think i managed to make a few friends for the first time in years i really havent made any new friends in the past   or   years  and ive only just realized that has been almost entirely my own fault  i attended relatively small schools growing up  and have been surrounded by the same faces pretty much all the way from kindergarten to graduation  there were always people around to talk to  but because i had my one friend i always hung out with i never felt the need to be closer with anyone else  it wasnt until i had a bad falling out with said friend that i realized how little i knew about the people around me and how much that sucked  i just didnt know how to build something past the initial pleasantries and small talk   for the past year or two ive hardly talked to anyone  and hardly anyone struggled to get to know me either since i had the conversational energy of a thumbtack  ive even been asked on a few dates  surprisingly  but ive always turned them down in fear of not knowing how to get close to them or hold a conversation  it was shitty  i just wanted to have people that i could hang out with and actually talk to  but felt like i didnt know how since i never put in the effort in grade school  talking to people who had more charisma than me just made me nervous  self conscious  and tight lipped    i finally wrapped my head around the fact that people wont just come up to me and suddenly be my best bud  that i can just sit there and expect friendship to land effortlessly in my lap  i have to try and its silly that ive been too scared to put in the effort  of course my anxiety issues are present and theres no easy cure for that  but i just tried my best to swallow it down and step outside my comfort zone and just talk to people  if it goes somewhere  great  if it doesnt  then at least im trying   my second year of college started up this past september and i just decided i was tired of things being shitty and shallow and lonely  in my spare time before and after classes i actually put in effort to try and talk to those around me if they didnt seem preoccupied  about the class  the weather  or maybe something ive heard them talking about before  just anything  i gave out friendly compliments to people because compliments are nice  i asked people about their interests and opinions on things and actually try to start a conversation and get to know them  these might seem like basic social skills  but theyre honestly things i wasnt doing before  i decided to try to be the type of person i wished would have approached me when i was lonely  and i think it worked  not only was i getting better at holding conversations  but it started to make me happier and feel better about myself too   a few weeks into the semester i was talking to one of my classmates while walking towards my locker after a lecture had ended  and they ended up stopping beside me when we reached my locker instead of continuing to their own or ending the conversation  it blew my fucking mind  they didnt need to grab anything  they just liked talking to me and that concept was completely foreign  for so long id been used to people only chatting to pass the time before going on to do something else  not because they actually enjoyed my company   later that same week  they asked me and a few others what we were planning on doing for lunch  and it took me a moment to realize they were asking for all of us to go together  going to lunch turned into a regular thing and i recently asked them and two others for their phone numbers so we could all catch a movie sometime   i just texted the small group this morning to try and organize the movie time and location for tomorrow and it sounds so lame to say but holy shit i think i made friends  we have actual conversations outside of small talk  we have similar interests  we hang out between schedules  and now were planning on going out and doing something just for fun  thats what friends do right   im sorry for this being written so sloppily and wordily  im on my phone and just wanted to ramble about it somewhere without seeming pitiful  and this sub is a place were little things like this can be celebrated  im a long time lurker  but the advice and sucess stories shared on here and other subs helped me a lot  and maybe my wall of text can do the same for somebody else  im really happy lately and i hope all of you are on your way to be happy too if youre not there already   tiny update  movie times didnt work out  so were going to a museum instead  i honestly think that may be even more interesting and im really excited       ,0

scheduled my first ever second date  i m an awkward guy   i have one close friend and i talk to my brothers all the time  but talking to most people is a struggle   i recently decided that i want to pursue the idea of dating more vigorously     about a week ago i went on a date that went unrealistically well   conversation was easy  we ended up visiting for like   hours  and we reciprocated interest in keeping this going   a couple days ago i suggested we meet up again  and so we scheduled a museum date for tomorrow   she even said that if we get bored of the museum  i can join her on her sunday walk with her dog   i am actually super touched by this because that feels like a very  going steady  kind of activity   obviously we are not there  yet  but i ve never been seen by someone that way before     this is an accomplishment for me   i m excited to see where it goes    edit   went fairly well   i think we had a good time   plenty of smiling and laughing  solid museum experience   conversation is still easy   visited for about   hours   i think we agreed that we want to meet up again sometime   still excited to see where this goes   i think we have enough in common and are of use to eachother even just for knitting advice  so i dont expect us to astrange any time soon    edit      she just sent me a text saying that the age difference is too much    and       im a very disapointed  but if we stay friends it will still be worth it to me  ,0

went on my first date yesterday  so  im    and been struggling a lot with personal stuff  but im glad to say that a light of hope lit up as yesterday i went on my first date   tinder date  mind you  but a date after all   against all advice we went to the cinema  she suggested it  but after the movie we walked through a bay near the cinema and ended up kissing while watching the boats go  it was really nice  after that we had to leave and realized we didnt have much money or way to go home  we live far away from each other and far away from the cinema   so we ended up waiting an hour and a half for a bus which never came  while freezing and our legs aching  and we ended up taking an uber  there werent any cars available before  and laughing about the whole thing   just wanted to share this to have some positivity    ,0
i guess we could file this under good awkward  i was interviewing an employees cousin for a position at my company and she nailed it so were hiring her  i struggle with  tunnel vision  when im focused on someone so i made a b line to the employee  thanked her for having such wonderful family and gushed about her cousin before blurting out  and she doesnt know yet  but shes hired   as i turned to walk away  i realized her cousin was standing right there  but wearing a jacket so i didnt realize it was her  she looked confused but also happy  im so embarrassed  but at least it was a good thing i was saying about her and not bad  ,0

this is why you should talk to her  in the last couple of months i tried to approach random people  in the supermarket  in the gym  at school  randomly in the evening  and you know what  i understood why this is so important  you feel connected with the environment  you slowly stop living in your head  your anxiety slowly but progressively gets lower and lower  sometimes you will feel like its useless  because  i mean  they are just quick talks with people that youre probably never gonna meet again  right  hell no  i think the best representation of how anxiey really works has been made by  u larrythetomato   cheers man  that was super    https   imgur com a jy  h  the more you approach new people  the less anxiety and even rejections mean something to you      anyway  that was my context  today i felt great  i was entering in the library of my college confident and happy  because i studied a lot in the morning and had a good session at the gym  also doing some nofap and eating really well recently  that helps a lot with the mood   i think this is important  you should be proud of the things you do  and in order to feel the proudness  you must give everything in your work  you dont do half training  you dont skip the most difficult paraph  you dont check your facebook instagram while studying  dont believe in multitasking     while entering  i noticed a very nice girl that was studying alone  and that had a quick look around  really really stunning  i kept on walking  not really wanting to have my comfort zone being shaken again  i sat in a table alone  far away from her  after some seconds of sitting i thought  why not    i stand up  why am i saying this  because i know we people tend often to think things like  oh  whatever  the moment is gone   no  the moment is not gone until you say so    took my things and walked straight next to her  asked if the chair was free  she said yes  and sat next to her  we werent really close  but we were in the same table  she was studying and listening some music with the headphones  for a moment i thought  she is listening some music cause she doesnt want to be bothered   but i immediatly silenced myself and my brain   i started to open my books  while noticing that she had a dictionary  she probably wasnt from my country  i thought i could ask her    here my comfort zone hit hard  my mind started making excuses  i started to feel anxious  you know the thing  started thinking  yeah  but how can i ask her something if shes listening music  i will speak  she wont understand  so ill have to repeat  it will be already be awkard  bla bla bla     then i silenced my thoughts and said to myself   ok  i will now go to buy me some water and after that  when i return  ill try to speak to her   but then i understood a thing    that i would never forgive myself if i would return and she woudnt be there    i understood  as some people here already told many times  that i was just full of excuses and i needed to do something  i understood that you do or you do not  there is no try  thanks you master yoda     looked at her  and asked her if she was from here  asked why she had a dictionary  we talked  we took a cofee together  turns out shes not from another country  shes just studying another language  she lives in the surroundings  she likes traveling  i do like it as well  wont go in details  just that when we left she said  i am really happy to have met you today   she gave me her number  i am pretty sure we will meet again  if we wont  thats not a problem  i know there are a ton of wonderful people out there  who just want to meet other good people    good luck guys  hope this may inspire someone      p s  forgot what could probably be the most important part  afterwards she said to me that in the library she already finished studying  and if i didnt talk to her she would have probably left in some minutes  she already had some books closed    if i didnt talk to her right when i did it  i would have probably never seen her again       carpe diem    my brothers     p p s  woke up with a  good morning     from her on my cell today     ,0
is anyone else boring as fuck basically my hobbies are  internet  talking to people about events i m mostly uninterested in  and sleeping  i get tired easily of talking too  i have some things i like  but even the things i like  i have a shallow depth in passion for and sometimes i really couldn t care less about them       am i depressed or just really really boring   dies   and  for those of you who were once similarly apathetic as me but became passionate about something  how       posting here because  in order to have a good social life  i think being interesting is essential  ,0
i have literally zero friends in college hey all  im currently a sophomore going to college in a different state  and i have no friends  acquaintances  anybody to talk to  literally nothing  i managed to get pretty close to my roommate during my freshman year but he unfortunately transferred to a different school  the only real social contact i get throughout the week are occasional online phone chats that i have with high school friends or my old roomate   i think the major problem is my social anxiety  and my inability to take initiative and go up to people  even when given opportunities  and most of the friends that i had made in high school came to me  even then  i tend to have a really thick shell  and it takes a while for me to feel comfortable and not awkward around someone  im generally a really introverted person but the loneliness is really starting to get to me  and seeing all the happy people walking around  hanging out with friends makes me feel like utter shit  i want to try and be more outgoing and go up to others  but my social anxiety is making it near impossible and i honestly have no idea where to start  so any advice  or tips from people with similar experiences would be greatly appreciated   something i forgot to add  ive tried a few clubs  and had some very small casual interactions but large groups of people make me really uncomfortable and anxious so it didnt really come to anything   ,0
little mindset shift thatll improve your confidence in social situations   edit  i now write a weekly newsletter dedicated to helping you achieve social   dating success  you can join that here   https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine   https   mailchi mp deae       f socialitemagazine         i used to stress about every single situation   i d play scenarios in my head  which i now call  future forecasting   where i d predict how things would happen and what i d do in any given situation   i d imagine certain things happening  conversations going a certain way  i d imagine the best case scenarios and worst case scenarios   this led me to me always being  in my head    it also led to me  glorifying  a moment that may or may not even happen  in      times  it never happened the way i imagined    furthermore  when i glorified  id put so much importance on a future event  that it only made me anxious  i would over stress about it   so i decided to change this habit  meditation helped me realize it  and id highly recommend meditation to anybody  but  if you dont have time to do it  heres the takeaway     focus on the moment  dont think about what may or may not happen in the future     instead  trust your faculties  trust that no matter what arises  you will handle it well  whatever social situation arises  you have the ability to deal with it as eloquently as you know how      when ends up happening when you make this shift is you give yourself permission to be confident  its a very small  yet empowering shift    what also ends up happening when you make this shift is that you become more spontaneous  you embrace whatever the moment brings without anticipating whats next  and thats the beauty of it all    because truth is  you cant calculate everything  especially in social situations  you cannot forecast or predict how every interaction will go  thus  its best to quit thinking about what may or may not happen and instead enjoy whatever is in front of you   meditation taught me this  but i found it to be so applicable to my dating and social life  its made every interaction and connection i have much  much richer     tl dr  quit  future forecasting   trust in yourself that no matter what situation arises  you will be able to handle it well      good luck     laz  ,0

thanks to this sub  went out to a bar for the first time in my life and had a great time im a    year old man who struggles with social skills   i dont have any friends apart from a couple of coworkers who i never see outside of the office  so i almost never go out   i feel like i dont really know how nightlife works   but after coming across  this post  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  ykpin   from   years ago  i decided to give it a try   actually  it took a mental struggle to make that decision and i very nearly abandoned the idea   at first i started thinking about what a friendless loser i was and had to fight off a wave of depression   then i began to worry about whether i had the right clothing to go to a bar  whether i would be able to navigate the protocols of ordering and tipping  and so on   and of course i didnt know where to go   but finally i found a nearby place on yelp  put on a polo shirt  and just went   my plan was to sit down at the bar and try to be open to whatever happened   i had resolved to stick with it for at least one hour  and had brought a book as a backup strategy  but it turned out to be unnecessary  except perhaps psychologically    i sat down and started looking around at the other people  trying not to look as uncomfortable as i felt   and incredibly enough  three people in succession came by and made themselves available for conversation   the first person was a woman who was there with some friends   although she seemed interested in talking  i hit an awkward note and the conversation died pretty quickly   when someone she knew walked by she took the opportunity to disengage   fair enough   the second person i talked to was a latino man who came up next to me  ordered a beer  and stood there looking like a well groomed statue   i briefly tried to strike up a conversation but he seemed to be a man of few words so i gave it up   the third person i met was an older woman who was there after work   unlike the first two people  somehow or other we hit it off   we ended up having a long conversation about all sorts of topics    work  animals  technology  and so on   even though there were moments of awkwardness the conversation survived and i ended up talking with her for more than an hour   i really had a nice time and she also seemed to be enjoying the conversation   towards the end i started to feel fatigued and unable to hold up my end of the conversation as well  and i left a bit awkwardly  but i still think it was a largely successful interaction   right now im mentally exhausted but very happy   not only did i push my social limits and practice my skills  i also had a lovely time doing so   i still have a long way to go building up social skills but i feel very encouraged to keep at it and see how far i can get   i wanted to thank  u merv    and  u mootjeuh for the comments that led me to give this a try       https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  ykpin single very few friends and bored what can i do cfli ee        https   www reddit com r socialskills comments  ykpin single very few friends and bored what can i do cflek s    ,0
becoming yourself hey     m  my gf and i broke up about a month ago  after   years  shit was rough  at first i thought changing myself and becoming who she wanted to be was the answer  i beat myself up thinking i could have  worked on myself  harder to become the perfect specimen for her  i now realize that our relationship was more one sided than anything  me constantly changing for her  and sucking things up  if i can stop just one person from doing that same thing  that would make me so happy  be yourself  even for you so  if they don t accept you for that  kick them to the curb  don t waist the most precious years of your life  ,0
it s healthy to distance yourself from friendships that aren t working anymore this is a very recent insight i ve had about friendships  and the idea of growing apart from people  a couple of years back  i used to believe that friendships should last forever and that you should really work at friendships if you re growing apart   as a result  some of these friendships were quite unhealthy  i would try to stay friends with people i had clearly grown apart from  and so would the other person  resentment would occur because we would be trying to force something when the two of us just weren t compatible anymore  for example  i would want to feel close and have deep conversations  meanwhile they would spend most of our time on their phones while we were hanging out  those friendships would have quite a lot of passive aggressiveness and covert disrespect  i would come away feeling drained and undervalued  and i m sure the other person felt similar    i ve realised that when you feel like you ve drifted apart from someone and no longer have things to talk about  and if resentment starts mounting  the most mature thing to do is to distance yourself  and not play the blame game  otherwise  you re just going to keep having arguments  and both people are just going to keep getting hurt    if i sense that someone is pulling away from me and becoming less available  i feel thankful  whereas before i would feel hurt and angry  i would much rather a person maturely disengage from me than to keep me around as a backup  or to start tearing me down and taking their insecurities out on me due to their resentment of me    we all deserve better than to be friends with people who make us feel like we are hard to like  i want to focus on friendships based on a mutual love and care for each other  friendships where we lift each other up  and where we can openly communicate  ,0

life turned around as i worked on my social anxiety  i am    something and i moved from a different country for education and work  this was a major social disruption in my situation  i worked as an engineer  good pay enough to pay for a sports car and a decent house  i landed in a job where i was working in an ev industry that ive been so passionate about in college  i was where i wanted to be in life  but something was missing  i felt very empty as i had no friends    i also realized now that how socially anxious i really was when it came to talking to complete strangers  which was basically anyone to begin with  being single  and with family friends in a different timezone  i was growing isolated  i would look at other people having fun and hanging out in groups  having fun at local events and beer fests and i would sit in a corner and look at them like a creep  never actually making a connection   i would look at the ladies i had instant crushes on  and would sit and only wonder what would be like to have them in my life  but what would actually help me  actually talk with them now that i realize  i never did  i would choke up on the thought of even saying hi  once or twice when i did muster up the courage  i would compliment them in the most feeble voice  with sheepish smile and looking away  theyd either be weirded out or just smile lightly and walk away fast   i did get invited to one or two cool parties  where again i would try to laugh with others and be part of thier fun  but never bringing my own fun  their mundane stories would sound so fun  and even my interesting ones would sound dry and boring  i would see people give a sympathetic smile just cause i said something  and then theyd move on to their fun  although nobody said it but i could sense that i was being repulsive   outside of work  my life was really empty  i would watch movies  hit the gym or drink excessively had polar habits haha  anything that would fill my time  i craved meaningful social connections  but my loneliness was fueling my social anxiety and self hate which turned out to be a downward spiral  id read some self help and watch some motivational videos and derive comfort out of it  but never put anything into action   there was a girl that i have been obsessing over text trying to get her over a long distance relationship   thats how scarce my midset was  the rejection from her was the rock bottom for me  by this time i was constantly sad and was thinking to myself why is this hapening to me   i got so frustrated at my situation that one day i called in sick at work  packed some camping gear in my car and drove into the mountains  not knowing where i was going or what i was doing  after     days of self loathing out in the nature  i didnt have a solution  i wasnt relaxed either  but i had realized by then that there are only two things i could do about this situation  either keep crying and keep hating myself for the crappy unfulfilling situation i was in  or take responsibility over my situation and act on it  find out what works and build an amazing social life  the stark difference between these two choices was so clear to me that i came back and made a commitment to myself  i actually wrote a contract to myself and signed it  that id do anything possble to get my shit together   i told myself that i will not stop on this journey of understanding social interactions and building connections regardless of the setbacks i may get  i actively started going out to clubs  bars  weekend events  travel to hostels in different cities and talk to as many people i could  my social anxiety would not let me though  so it was a very uncomfortable situation that i had to put myself in  i would freeze and had to awkwardly exit the conversations cause i was so embarassed  but sometimes i knida managed to ride the wave  i would document my interactions in my journals and i started to see patterns  i would then think of various ideas that i could try in an interaction and see the reponses to it  i also acknowledged my anxiety and tried to embrace and live with it  with each interaction i was becoming better and more confident   i began to realize that how my thoughts  words and actions were changing and getting more coherent  i could hold a conversation longer  create emotional swings  share deep connections with the people i was talking with  a couple months later into this active practice  ive had so many epiphanies about social skills and it was turning out to be such a beautiful thing  i was finding myself in interactions that i didnt even start  people were now also wanting to talk to me  my anxieties were begining to melt away   as opposed to being needy and awkward when id meet a girl  i was able to be myself and have fun  this journey did lead to amazing adventures for me  i no longer plan my travels with anyone  i can basically be anywhere and not be lonely  two years ago  i used to think that charisma is something only some lucky and good looking people had  i now believe and have proven to myself and helped others  that it is something you can cultivate    my extensive journaling in this process helped me come up with a step by step plan on how one can overcome their social anxiety and build pro level social skills as a working professional  and i now help other people in similar situations    i can tell you now this that it is indeed a beautiful  painful  empowering and fun journey of creating a     version of yourself  life is an adventure  if you make it one  ,0

i m a shy  quiet  anxious  and nervous person  but i m at peace with it now  for the longest time i used to think there was something wrong with me because ever since i was a kid i was always shy  quiet  and nervous around new people and in most  if not all  social situations  recently i ve begun to think otherwise for the first time in my life  and i actually feel way more confident than i used to  i feel that this who i am  and yes they are my limitations  but these are what make me who i am so i m sort of proud that i can accept that now  i used to wish that i could be more open and extroverted like people i went to school with or friends i had    i always stutter my words  i can never make and keep eye contact  and i m unable to make coherent thoughts out loud  but that s how it is for me  don t get me wrong  i still can t keep a conversation going or maintain good relationships most of the time  but i try  i m not ashamed of it  at    years of age  i think i m finally at peace with being the nervous person i am  it isn t easy  it never is  but i don t think i d change anything  ,0

i want to stop hating women im a high  functioning incel  and i need help in order to change     the above has been one of the hardest thing ive ever had to admit  considering how i have female friends  im not a basement  dwelling neet  i have a bit of sexual experience   sort of  read on to see what mean      and my friends and i often mocked how ridiculous and distorted incel foreveralone views are  i guess i was in denial of the fact that as extreme as their hatred and entitlement might be  there was always a small part of me that resonated with their point of view  as i myself have held bitterness towards women for years  because of my childhood experiences   im not going to recount my life story  but to sum it up  i grew up in a female  domiated household with lots of physical and emotional abuse from which no one was spared  my mom kicked my father out and alienated him from my family when i was a kid   and also did her best to poison us against him    and things just went downhill from there  mom  and sisters fought  sisters fought with each other  and i wasnt a very assertive kid   i was scared shitless of them  actually   so i just learned to protect myself through emotional distance and quiet hatred   what i didnt realize until recently however  is that that fear  distrust and spite towards the women in my life prevented me from ever having healthy  deep relationships with women outside my home as well  im well into adulthood and have never had a girlfriend  not because of a lack of opportunities  but because of a lifelong habit of self  sabotage whenever the opportunity arose  i never had a problem making female friends  but when it came to intimacy  i always subconsciously found a way to screw it up   being distant  being rude  using stupid excuses to convince myself that im not interested in the girl  being extremely awkward  trying too hard to the point where its off  putting  being unable to perform in bed     up to now i though that i just lacked confidence    which is interesting  because im pretty confident in other areas of my life    but recently ive dug deeper and realize that theres more to it  throughout my life ive developed a combination of two things  neediness   as my mom and sisters were my caretakers    and distrust   because i knew how hurtful they could be at the drop of a dime   towards women  which  as you can imagine  is recipe for staying single and lonely and developing low self esteem  which hurt my chances further  continuing the cycle   im tired of seeing an attractive girl and immediately thinking about the ways she might be mean  shallow or manipulative  im tired of feeling spite when i see happy  beautiful couples on tv  in the street or in social media  ive never felt entitled to women or sex  but i cant help but feel wronged by the world when i have put in a lot effort to improve myself  put myself out and tried to socialize and ask girls out  but its all been in vain  i understand how irrational and toxic these thoughts and feelings are  which is why the cerebral part of me has swept them under the rug through denial  but the reality is  those thoughts and feelings  however wrong  are real  and i need to acknowledge them and work through them  i would imagine now that my lack of romantic success was likely in part due to the fact that the women ive met could see the bitterness and distrust that for so long i havent been able to notice and acknowledge in myself   i dont blame myself for what happened to me as a kid  or the coping mechanism that ive developed  but i do realize that its my responsibility to use this self reflection to move forward and change my attitude for the better  im starting cbt on my own and have begun to see a therapist to talk things out further  but i was wondering if anyone here can relate or offer advice for letting go of bitterness and judgement towards women in my life   tl dr  how do i get rid of my incel  like toxic mindset that stems from an childhood of abuse by the women who took care of me   edit  holy shit     its my first time posting on reddit  and i did not expect this kind of overwhelmingly warm response for such a dark confession  thank you everyone for the sound advice  the kind words of encouragement  and the inspiring personal stories you shared to help me out   ,0
does anyone else feel like they werent socialized properly  ive been a loner for as long as ive lived with little to no friends over the years  even in preschool and primary school i have vivid memories of sitting alone by myself as everyone around me played around  i feel like there is no cure after all these years  ,0
if you hit on someone and theyre not interested  just leave them alone and move on to someone else  dont be mean to them because theyre not into you everyone isnt attracted to everyone and thats just the way it is  its best to just leave them alone  pestering someone isnt going to make them change their mind anyways  ,0
if you met yourself in real life  would the two of you get along  if the answer is  no   maybe it s time for a change   there is only one person in the world who you can guarantee will stay with you no matter where you go  no matter what choices you make  and no matter how you choose to live your life  you   can you trust in you to have your back when shit hits the fan  are you the first person you want to tell about your achievements  can you air your frustrations to you  and expect understanding and comfort   being the kind of person you want to be around is vital to being confident  happy and being able to love others  investing time in one s own development is an underrated endeavour  and if there s anything we should be trying to do with our lives  it s becoming a better person for ourselves   it s very easy to be overly critical  so rather than focusing on what you dislike about yourself  focus instead on the traits that draw you in to people  what kind of things do the people you like do  what kind of things do they say  how do they act with others  and how do they act behind closed doors  if you value these traits in others  then it s more than likely you would value these traits in yourself  too   now  it s all well and good to think about these traits  it may even be worthwhile to write them down  but to truly become someone you want to be around       you re going to have to take action  turn those values  principles and character traits into action steps you can implement in your daily life   as an example  imagine you really enjoy people who are easy to talk to  well  how then would you become easy to talk to  what makes someone easy to talk to anyway  they d probably be good listeners  they d know how to keep conversations going  and they d probably know how to provide their own opinions and anecdotes to a conversation without crowding out the other participants  do a google search for each of those points  read articles  watch youtube videos  observe good conversationalists and good storytellers  find analyses on these people done by other people  from here  take each trait of the easy conversationalist and create an action step  my three would look something like this    good listener    when someone is telling me a story  listen  and try to remember one important point in the future  this will get me out of my own head    keep conversations going    when other people in the conversation say things  even trivial things  try to take one of their points and expand on it   participate myself    try to make sure that everything i add to a conversation refers to something that someone else said  i believe that once you re willing to invest in yourself like this  and perform the actions you ve laid out  two things will happen     your self confidence will skyrocket   that inner critic in your noggin is going to find less and less bad things to say about you  i mean  how often do you criticise the people you truly admire     you will begin to attract people like you into your life   you know how i said that if you value a trait in others  it s likely you d value that trait in yourself  too  well  other people like you are going to feel exactly the same way  the kind of people who value what you value will find you to be a joy to be around  and you re probably going to really enjoy adding them to your life  it s not going to happen overnight  there may be many different traits you feel like you need to work on or implement in your life  but just by working on one of them  you ll become more and more like your ideal friend  and you ll be able to put more and more trust in yourself   one belief i hold very dear is that being able to love yourself is one of the vital components of true happiness  and being the person you want to be around will only make it easier  ,0
last night i overcame my fear of exposing my body so last night we had a talent show in our school where we tried to raise some money for our prom  there were singing acts  dance acts  theater acting and so on    so i have been self conscious about my obesity my whole life because of judgement and bullying  well on this talent show thingy i had to act as an ancient roman  in toga and everything  and i had a  shower scene  where i wore nothing but swimming shorts and sang bella ciao in front of like     people with cameras and shit  and i did feel super uncomfortable but i knew i had to do it   so i was there on the stage and just fucking enjoyed it because it made people laugh  but with me instead of about me  that felt hella great   i call that  active meditation   as i imagine meditation to be something you do to let go of your own self  so instead of sitting somewhere alone and thinking about life and shit i decided to just stand up and be myself and let my fears fall behind   and it worked   thanks for reading ,0
started my path to happiness  a year ago  i was so anxious  antisocial and insecure that i nearly failed college because i wouldnt ask anyone for help  i left school as soon as i could and would put my phone on  do not disturb  so i wouldnt have to talk to anyone   yesterday  i moved three hours away from my family and only friend   for years ive been wanting to travel and move away from my normal day to day but always felt people were holding me back  i finally told myself that i am the only one that will make changes to make me happy  i got a job at the best skiing resort in the province  said goodbye to everyone i know  and drove up to my staff housing where i share a house with    complete strangers  i was terrified and probably cried the entire drive up  when i got to the house everyone was at work  i left and came back a few hours later and there were about   people hanging out in the common area   now even more terrified  they introduced themselves and invited me out to dinner with them  i had a great night  and now i feel so much more comfortable  they told me they really like me and theyre glad i moved in to their house  im so happy  ive used a lot of advice from this subreddit and as scary as it may be  it works  people love people who talk and ask questions and socialize  and thats what im trying to do more often  thank you to everyone in this community as you have helped immensely   edit  wow  thank you to everyone for all your kind comments  im so happy many people got to read my story and hopefully gain some hope for themselves  im going in for my first official day at the job now  wish my luck         ,0

absorb people when i was sixteen at worked at this burger joint  i had this co worker  well call her  nancy   nancy was beautiful  smart  and most of all  charming  she could talk her way in and out of anything  and she had a way with her words where she could just keep someone completely focused on what she was saying  it was  hypnotizing     her and i became friends  surprisingly   greasy haired  pimple faced  awkward teenager   she was my best friend ever  i loved her  i do still love her  we spent hours at movies  diners  sports games  we did everything together  she gave me confidence in myself  i cleaned myself up  i started being more social  but that was the least of the extent of her power   in december      nancy died in a car accident  she was gone  just like that  i was in the car with her  not physically  but mentally  i was there  i was her  when she died  i died  i felt her soul leave her body and become one with me  i have become two souls of one body  and this incredible power makes me feel so great  i can talk to people with ease  ive been really working on getting friends   my main point here is that the impact others have on us can greatly improve our own confidence and strength  next time you see someone  even for a second  try to learn something from them  you may be able to absorb them for your own power  ,0
a good way to naturally draw people into your life live an interesting life    literally go outside and do stuff  whatever your passions are and whatever your hobbies are  go out and do it   if you don t really have any hobbies to begin with then this seems like the perfect time to start a new one  if you have some friends then invite them to join but if not  then that s fine too because you can do activities by yourself   so  i use to be a socially awkward and didn t know how to start making friends and cultivate closer relationships  during this time  i didn t have a lot going on in my life and mainly kept to myself  i tried to be social and make friends but i always had a difficult time doing so  i would get their contact information and then hit them up later to try and hang out but i would get flaked on a lot  this constantly kept happening    but something i started i telling myself was that i was going to do things that i enjoyed with or without other people in my life  i started doing activities by myself that i was passionate about  some of my main hobbies included playing basketball  tennis  working out  toastmasters  traveling  edm concerts  eating good food  and partying  when i started living my life this way  a funny thing happened  i started to become social a lot more easily and flakes happened less frequently  first of all  doing all these activities allow you to meet people who have the same interests  so boom  right there you automatically know you and another person already have something in common  i can t tell you how many people i ve met through playing basketball with them  i play basketball with the same group of       guys weekly now  some of them have become good friends of mine and we do activities outside of basketball together to this day    but the surprising thing i ve noticed is more people were becoming drawn towards me and they were the ones initiating the contact with me  more people would ask to hang out or they wanted to join in on my activities  this didn t happen to me before because i didn t do much with my life  it dawned on me that people are attracted to other people who lead interesting lives  think about it  would you want to hang out with some bum who doesn t really do anything except eat  sleep  and take up space  also  i used to try to join in on other peoples plans instead of inviting them to my activities  now  i m the one who is initiating the hanging out since i was already going to do what i was going to anyway  other s are now joining along for my ride not vice versa  this was truly a huge revelation for my social life  so guys  go out there and do what your passionate about  the new people you meet will follow along for the ride later    pro tip  the power of social media really comes in handy here  use it to make posts and stories of all the interesting things that you re doing in your life  the people who follow you will be intrigued by all of the cool things your doing and some will want to join in  it kind of showcases your life in a non braggy way  this has been really key for me and i normally get messages on snapchat or instagram after i posted a story  one of the things i post about is food  i m a big foodie and i m constantly going around my city to eat at all the unique spots and i take a ton of food pics and post them  because of that  people who are interested in food want to join me in my food adventures now lol   ,0
i tried to ask out one of my friends  she said no  but i m still super proud and happy i started talking to her through an after school activity  since we had two of the same things we were part of  i slowly started to like her more and more as i talked and got to know her  and we became friends  once one of our projects came to an end  i tried asking her out  she said no  but that she thinks i m a cool guy and that she likes me  but as a friend  it make me sad  but i felt super happy too because we are still friends and they re an awesome one  and also because i did something i couldn t see myself doing a year ago  which was trying to ask someone out  it was a huge confidence boost especially since it wasn t a huge deal and just kind of was an opportunity to find out if something was possible between us    i m glad we are still friends though  and now i won t be as scared to try asking out someone i like in the future  ,0
i have dumped all my toxic friends  let s gooo  months ago i have made a post discussing about if i was in a toxic friendship and i have been definitely in one  i hadn t dumped them because i was scared of loneliness  but now i don t give a fuck about being lonely at all  i mean i have   friends left  but i won t spend time with them everyday lol   i realized that i can have fun by myself by developing new hobbies like learning an instrument  hitting the gym and talk to people there  playing old childhood video games and skateboarding   i firmly believe that i will find new  good  friends soon  ,0

these   skills will completely change your social life  repost  if you use these skills youll connect with people on a deeper level than youre used to   youll learn to love talking with people  and people will love talking with you     skill      a good listener doesnt listen to respond  they listen to learn      listening  is not just  hearing   its asking good questions that help you   understand   the other person   my girlfriend told me   i dont like it when you tell me how to do things  i feel like youre judging me       im not judging you    i said    it was just a suggestion       i was not listening     regardless of how i experienced it  her experience was that i was judging her   a bad listener focuses on explaining his own experience   a good listener focuses on learning about the other persons experience     which part makes you feel like im judging you       was it what i said  or how i said it       how would you like me to make suggestions in future  or would you prefer it if i didnt make suggestions     a good listener improves the way he relates with the other person by learning how they think  learning whats important to them   a bad listener learns nothing   at an interview for a sales job i was asked   how will you bring us    new clients in your first month     i didnt have an answer prepared  i panicked and blurted out the usual ways of reaching new clients  it was an empty  generic answer     i was not listening  any monkey couldve rattled off that list     when the interviewer asked that question what he really wanted to know was   does this guy know what he is doing    a good listener wouldve unpacked the interviewers question and learned what the interviewer was looking for     you know i havent really thought about specific strategies  whats your biggest bottleneck right now in getting new clients on board     a good listener aims to understand deeply   a bad listener misses the point     skill      how to quickly find common interests  not the way youre thinking     dont get stuck in polite conversation  theres no  skin  invested in it  youve got to get at least a little bit naked  so to speak  in order to make friends with someone  heres how you do it   we humans have just      basic emotions  depending on which study you read  joy  trust  fear  surprise  sadness  disgust  anger and anticipation  everything we experience triggers a combination of these basic emotions  there aren t that many combinations   we may not have experienced the same activities  but we have experienced the same emotions  so when i say you need to find common interests  i mean you need to find something that sparks similar emotions  in both of you   say felipe is studying to be an architect  and manuela is studying to be a doctor  felipe doesn t care about medicine and manuela doesn t care about architecture  they ask each other polite questions    felipe   oh i hear you have to study for a long time to be a doctor  how many years do you have left    manuela   yeah  i ve got another   years    total  although you never really stop learning  what do you want to design when you graduate    felipe   bridges  i mainly want to design bridges  but i guess i d be happy designing anything    manuela   yeah i know what you mean  i just want to graduate already as well   this is pretty boring  right  neither of them are offering or asking for emotional information  you need to make an effort to understand  them  this chit chat isn t going to cut it   at this level of conversation they have to keep thinking of new topics every few seconds  the ideas will dry up pretty soon  this is why conversations often feel like hard work  it s much easier to pause and explore one topic for a while   so here s what you do       you don t just listen to respond  you listen to understand  you go deeper       offer your own emotional information    and dig for their emotional information   keep digging until you understand their way of thinking  until you feel the emotion they re talking about  then show them that you understand by sharing a similar experience of your own   these questions are your friends     what do you like about that     what made you want that     what scares you about that     essentially any question that uncovers  what makes you feel that way   or  what makes you think that way    what tends to work better than why because what feels like you re curious and why can sometimes feel like an attack   why do you like that    because i do  whats your problem     so back to felipe and manuela  now that they know how to  listen to understand   how does their conversation go    felipe   i mainly want to design bridges  but i guess i d be happy designing anything    manuela   what do you like about designing bridges specifically    felipe   well i havent actually designed one yet  but for some reason i keep picturing myself standing on top of a huge bridge that i designed  i don t know  it just makes me feel alive    manuela   yeah that sounds pretty cool  what do you mean by  alive  though    felipe   hmm  well the bridge started as an idea in my head  and now i m standing on it  it s like having ultimate control over everything    manuela   oh i know that feeling  that s how i feel when i think of saving someone s life at the last minute in the emergency room  boom  doctor in control    felipe   haha  is that what made you decide to become a doctor  because you like feeling in control    manuela   yeah  i guess it is    felipe   wow  that s the same reason i decided to be an architect  so does that mean you hate it when other people boss you around too    manuela   omg that s the worst   i can t stand it when other people tell me what to do   fun  turns out they re both control freaks  that s their common interest  now they can geek out on that instead of churning through countless emotionless topics that they don t connect on     skill      how to never run out of things to say    imagine you have a conversational d pad  it gives you something to say whenever you run out of things to say   these are the controls   https   qph ec quoracdn net main qimg e      f    c   a efbb c     ba  c convert to webp true   say you re in a conversation about cars  and you don t know anything about cars  you run out of things to say  what are your options   heres your conversational d pad for cars  https   qph ec quoracdn net main qimg   d   d dbb f dd fecfefc   ad f  convert to webp true   some people prefer to  zoom out   they think and talk about general things  ideas and concepts   some people prefer to  zoom in   they think and talk about specific things  details and examples   you ve probably had conversations with people where you just don t click with them  it could be because you prefer to zoom in and they prefer to zoom out  or vice versa     example     elena   how was your day    pablo   good  productive  i got a lot done  how was yours    elena   well  when i woke up i made toast  with butter and vegemite  i left it in the toaster a little too long and it got a bit burnt  but i scraped it off with a knife and it was fine  then i cycled to work  i went down oxford street this time instead of my usual route down henry cotton drive because i wanted a change   my boss didn t have anything for me to do today so i made an appointment to see the doctor next wednesday at  pm and spent the rest of the day on facebook chatting to sofia about her baby  ivan  who has a cold and esteban about his new porsche  then i came home down oxford street again because it was so lovely in the morning  it wasn t as nice in the evening  and now i m talking to you    pablo   so was your day good or not    elena   i want to know what you did all day   pablo likes ideas and concepts  zoomed out   elena likes details and examples  zoomed in    pablo is bored senseless by elena s details and elena feels like pablo doesn t want to share things with her   pablo is interested in the big picture  he wants to understand the point of what elena is telling him  what does it mean  did she have a good day or a bad day   elena is interested in specifics  she wants to know what made pablo s day good or bad  what does he mean by  productive   what did he get done   if you find yourself in a conversation that just isn t working you might be speaking to someone who has a different zoom preference  all you have to do to connect with them is zoom in or out to match their preference   if they prefer to zoom in  give them details and examples  if they prefer to zoom out  give them the meaning behind your details and examples   if you want more actionable advice like this  get your daily dose of communication hacks and people skills  here

how to make friends like a normal person   note  i am a male and i am in college   thus the pronouns will be male and the situations will be college oriented  but this stuff applies to any gender in any situation     when you meet a guy or group of guys for the first time  youre gonna want to be pretty high energy   smile and laugh   dont try to be  cool  or stand offish   it just makes you seem like a dick   remember people tend to think everything is about themselves   if youre quiet and reserved around them  they wont think youre shy  theyll just think you dont like them or have no interest in talking to them   also  the energy shouldnt be initially focused on them  but on the situation youre in     start talking to them like you know them  standard info can be exchanged later   so  for example  lets say ive walked into a lecture hall to take a test and i sit down next to some dude                       me   grinning  you ready to crush this or what   him   noticing me for the first time  ha  lets hope so man   me  yeah i havent slept in    hours  i better fucking do well on this test   him   feeling more at ease  yeah same here man  pretty sure my veins have nothing but red bull flowing through them    laughs   me   extending my hand  focusing on him for the first time  im andrew   him   shaking my hand  rob   me  hey did you study the handouts he gave us   im screwed if theyre on the test                   notice how i began talking to him like he was already a buddy of mine  not like someone i have to  get to know    i began the conversation focused on the situation we were in  about to take a test   and did so lightheartedly  not in any kind of serious way   i also made it clear that i had no agenda   not even to make a friend   i was just looking to shoot the shit before taking a test   only after some back and forth did i introduce myself  and i did so with an attitude of   hmm  you seem cool  whats up    without actually saying that   and i did introduce myself fairly quickly   theres no need to drag a conversation on and on before you introduce yourself   do whatever feels natural   notice also that i went right back to our conversation after i introduced myself   dont fall into the trap of interviewing them all at once  i e   whats your major  what dorm are you in  what other classes are you taking   this just makes things awkward and unnatural   learn about each other slowly as you have a conversation about something else   i also began the conversation happy and high energy   i was grinning  and my opening line  are you ready to crush this   almost sounds like something a coach would say to his players before a big game   its high energy and positive   this is exactly what you need when youre becoming familiar with someone you dont know   in fact  being positive and high energy is a pretty good strategy for beginning any social interaction  even with someone you do know   finally  notice that  he responded to what i was saying    if someone is unresponsive when you strike up a conversation  i e  they only give you yes or no answers or just generally dont make an effort   then to hell with them   you are under no obligation to carry on a conversation with someone whos not willing to do their part in it   i have cut off conversations mid sentence with people who i thought were being unresponsive   sometimes ill even turn to the person sitting on the other side of me and strike up a conversation with them   if someone gives you a look like  why is this guy talking to me    then that person is an asshole   there is nothing weird about talking to the people in your immediate vicinity   this is a reflection of their own social incompetency   not yours      you have to get rid of this mindset that  im talking to this guy to make him like me    you are talking to this guy to see if you get along  with each other    if you dont  thats fine   just move on to the next person   a solid     of the people you meet are not going to connect with you very well   thats just the way it is   dont sweat it and certainly dont take it personally     when you guys are getting ready to go your separate ways  i e  the test is over   then if your conversation felt good and natural  and you genuinely like the person get their number   yes  this will often feel a little awkward but it is imperative that you do this if you want to continue the conversation   if you know youre going to see them again  i e  youre in the same class   you can sometimes wait and just say  good to meet you man ill see you on monday    otherwise  say  hey it was great to meet you man  we should hang out sometime    see how they respond to this   they may well suggest that you exchange numbers  in which case you exchange numbers   or they might be a little shy and afraid to suggest that you exchange numbers and they might just say  yeah we should man    so just say  alright why dont you give me your number and ill text you      once you get their number  text them right away with your name so they know who you are and have you saved in their phonebook   the text can be very short  something like  yo its andrew   or the like   then you actually have to text them   do not expect them to text you even if they asked for your number   most people will forget about you very quickly because they have lives going on   you will almost always have to make the first effort   you can text them anytime from a couple days later to a couple weeks later   if you sit on a number for more than a couple weeks  however  there is very little chance that they will remember you and it can even come off a little weird that you still remember them weeks later   dont procrastinate too long   its much better to first invite them to a group activity if possible   a sports game  a party  a study session   this takes the pressure off both of you to make conversation and allows you to observe them in a group of your friends and see how comfortable you feel around them  and them around you   if you find at this point that you dont really like them or feel good around them  then you are under no obligation to text them again   if you do like them  invite them to another activity or just to hang out  get food  watch tv or whatever   the activities can become more and more casual as you get familiar with them   after youve invited them out two or three times  they should start asking you to hang out  at least some of the time   if they dont  i would stop texting them until they text you   remember a relationship is two sided and they must put in their effort   you can make the initial contact but eventually it has to become a joint effort   its pretty much smooth sailing from here on out   as long as you open yourself up and spend time with them  remember that  openness and time  you will become increasingly better friends     a couple last pointers      who you are is always good enough   if you have to be someone youre not to get them to like you   you are not compatible with each other    dont waste time on people who are not going to be your good friends      dont settle ever   you deserve friends who like and respect you   if you have a friend who likes hanging out with you but doesnt respect you  i e  always puts you down  ditches you for other people  talks behind your back   call him out on it   if he keeps doing it  then cut him out of your life   hes not worth it      having friends is supposed to be fun   if a friend stresses you out more than he makes you happy  hes not worth having around   if it takes forever to get out of that  getting to know you  zone with a person  youre probably not compatible   this doesnt mean theyre a bad person or even a bad friend  it just means youre not compatible   forcing a relationship with them will only make both of you unhappy   and thats it   now get the fuck off reddit and start building your life    ,0

when i become close friends with someone  i put them on a pedestal is this common  i oftentimes see the good in people and so it makes sense when i spend a lot of quality time with them  i admire them  sometimes to the point where i get jealous of them and wish i had the things they had  i want to know how to stop doing this  ,0

why do i never have anything to say  i cant have real conversations because i never have anything to say  if someone talks with me i will just give some banal response  my replies are short and bland  i do ask things when they re talking so as to keep the conversation going but it just leads to nothing as my final response is eventually going to be  i see  or  oh   i wont take the conversation in my hands and actually start talking because nothing ever comes in my mind  conversations with me are pretty much one sided because of this  i sometimes am able to come up with something but it ends quickly and then im blank again  i can initiate conversations but its the same  short and bland  i cant take it any further  i never had what you call a deep  real conversation  the reason for this isnt anxiety as im the same with the people im comfortable with and even online  almost nobody ever talks to me because im like this  i cant go up and talk to people  i cant make friends  cant even keep a friendship because they re built on literally just talking  and i never had a girlfriend  is there any hope for me to change  am i just extremely boring and gotta live like this  im fucking tired   edit  thank you so much everyone for all your opinions  advice  motivation and your desire to help  i did not expect so much attention and such a number of comments  im overwhelmed  it means so much to me that you re all trying to help me with this  i will try my best to take notes from everyone and start applying them   ,0
why being nice is not good  hi all    i hope you are doing well    i am    years old male  was raised by parents who value people pleasing  the motto was  you never do things  say things which would make you look stupid    it sounds right  but the thing is  i am being so nice to people that some would take advantage about it and problem  i feel so bad and guilty to say no    it s a problem which has been with me all my life am trying to change but i feel every time a situation appears i lose control of my mind and i act immaturely shy  especially when sometime someone is being nice back to me  which is usually just to get what they want    is it weird that i feel guilt to say no    wish you wonderful day ,0
im so awkward around the men i like im    years old and im half way through my internship at a pharmacy  i am studying pharmacy tech   a few weeks ago a new employee became part of the store area  and i cant get him off my mind  hes older than me     something  he dresses nice and looks good  no interaction has happened between us though  some small stuff that i was too nervous to react to lol  i find myself really awkward with men  i wonder if fantasizing about the men i like makes my awkwardness worse when i get a chance at interacting with them  i could fantasize all day about guys  on how to start a conversation  having chemistry with them  etc   but i have never made my fantasies a reality  because i am so nervous and my anxiety kicks in everytime i see the men i like  whenever i see this guy i like at the pharmacy i automatically distance myself  make no eye contact  look away  get light headed and stupid  this always happens when i see a cute guy  then i go off and fantasize  and probably make it all worse  i dont exactly look for relationships  i just wish i had the courage to try and expose my feelings  and stop hiding  and if i fail horribly at least ill have a good story to tell my friends and family lol  what can i do to deal with this  ill appreciate any advice and experience     edit  so  much  feedback  i didnt expect so many comments and upvotes  i feel really good after reading so many similar experiences feelings you guys shared below  i appreciate the advices you shared  it was interesting to look at my situation from different perspectives  im glad my post opened up a space for others to share their feelings and experiences  and to feel identified and not so alone  itll be tough for me to follow these advices  i have been such an awkward child since forever lol  but your words have moved me to consider trying a little harder everyday  ps  im a female lol ,0
i spent so many years convincing myself i wasn t worth anyone s time that it s hardcoded into my psyche god i ve tried to write this post multiple times and just keep backspacing over myself   i m the weird super socially awkward kid you might have known way back in school who acted out all the time and did stupid shit for attention  the kind you d dread to be around  trust me  or maybe you were that person too  i don t want to dive too deep into it  but on the record a lot of it was coping with a broken home  idk if its the same for everyone like that  but there ya go   as you can imagine  bullying and social isolation generally come with the territory of being  that guy    it makes friendships difficult  as well as relationships  occasionally you make a friend or two but you also get strung along by different people who only know you as  that guy  and keep you around as a joke  except you re not entirely in on it  eventually  at least in my case  i had a moment where it dawned on me that i was the butt of a joke i created of myself  in my effort to play the character of the joker i convinced everyone i was a fool  sounds cliched but it kinda works  so eh   this led to a long toxic phase in my life where save a few friends i was convinced most of the people around me either explicitly hated me  were making fun of me  or thought i was generally annoying  this led to a complete inversion of my personality to the point where i was terrified of everyone and couldn t even maintain eye contact with people  this lasted from the start of high school as well as through most of college   during my years in college i was very lucky to meet a handful of amazing people  some who helped me come out of my shell  others who helped me cope with a horrible self loathing i d developed and told me it was okay to be myself  which eventually helped me even drop the  weird  act layered under the introvert    really the only thing i never got down was romantic sexual relationships  which for a while was fine because you know hey  you just learned how to make friends  i mean jesus who cares if you re single you re just relieved to feel normal for once  but as you get older you see a lot of your friends start to hook up and after about the  rd or so wedding you realize you re unlikely to see too much of them again  which  well  sucks    and you realize after your first failed relationship that you really only know how to make friends  not partners  there is this one girl who i did date  but it took a long time for me to open up to them even after being friends for years  and we ended up just going back to being friends  i m just no good at just grabbing a drink with some stranger  or swiping some random on tinder bumble etc  and i think that plays into my former toxic introverted period i mentioned above  being that way for almost    years ingrained something into my brain that makes me very cautious with trusting people  a sort of shock reflex to keep myself from opening up to people    i ve tried lots of things to improve myself to hope to shore up my self confidence  i work out and run a lot  i read weird obscure history  dm  and draw as hobbies  put in solid effort at work and try to keep my focus away from  oh woe is me  forever alone etc   but there s still those times where you ve just popped some food out of a microwave sitting in your apartment  and you realize while you met some great people in school who made you feel like a functioning person  they re off doing their life thing  you don t know how you re going to meet new people  romantically speaking you re also lonely but know no matter how many times you make yourself go to a bar or some social thing you re either going to have second thoughts and bail halfway through a conversation or worry that you come off as a cold person    anyway  tldr  it s      in the morning  i m eating some microwaved mac n cheese  the corners are gross microwave burned  and realizing that at    years old while the rest of my life is going fairly well  i feel horribly alone and simultaneously unable to open up trust new people from past experience  part of me says live with it and become a hermit who makes wholesome bill watterson esqe comics and the other part desperately seeks some sort of insight or direction to tackle my issues  please help me  ,0
being authentic is empowering i went to a party yesterday  i barely knew anyone  just one person  i was quite uncomfortable at first  the music was loud and people were pratically shouting  and seemed to already know each other quite well    the old me would have told myself to  shapen up  and do my hardest to socialize  the new me is  on my own team   which means i practice self compassion  instead of telling yourself that you  must  socialize  and do your best to keep conversations going  you can tell yourself   yes  this is a socially challenging situation  i am a bit introverted  the music is loud  people are all around the place  and i cannot really expect to have a great conversation any time soon     i ended up leaving quite early after talking mostly to one person i met there and bonded with pretty well  but the old me would have felt ashamed and disappointed in myself for leaving a party early  and not have had so fun  feeling left out a lot    this is another  quite huge issue with social issues i think  socially insecure people are often not on  their own team   they believe they need to bully themselves into starting conversations  but honestly  it is okay  relax  stop the self blame  be yourself  own it  own you emotions  just because you struggle socially  have few friends  this does not mean you should treat yourself harshly  if anything  it is the other way around  through radical self acceptance and self compassion  you will make choices more aligned with your true self  and making decisions and acting authenticly to yourself is one of the greatest confidence boosters there are    i left this party feeling more confident than ever after parties  i did not try to  fit in  or change myself  but i made some small talk about things that interested me  i did not try very hard to keep conversations going if they were becoming silent  i did not try too hard to talk to people that had little interest in me  i let go  i let going of trying so much  i let myself just be me    becoming better socially is about just that  being more of yourself  sharing stories that you like  discussing topics that interest you  socializing should actually not be about pushing yourself to be someone you are not  but i feel like over the years of having a hard time being social  i completely missed out on that fact  instead i got caught up in learning  social skills   screw social skills  honestly    socializing is about you feeling good  feeling good with others  and feeling good enough to actually want to talk to people  if you are not at the point that you want to talk to someone  you probably have issues with allowing yourself to be yourself  because when you are yourself  and authenthic  socializing wont feel risky or scary  it is simply an act of expressing yourself   well    this was just some thoughts   d    x   b  ,0
im not an introvert  im just an extrovert whos bad at it  can anyone else relate to this      m   i love making connections with people and just getting to know interesting people is always a great time for me regardless of occasion  i never feel like my energy is  drained  when im in social situations  in fact when im alone i often think of what id be speaking about to my one of friends if they were sitting with me right now  i felt absolutely horrible after one weekend i had a while back where i didnt speak to anyone   despite that  i think im a bad conversationalist and im often socially awkward or just fail to spark interesting discussion  in the context of meeting new people  im pretty fine once ive made friends with them   ,0
how to get better at friendly banter teasing  i feel too uptight  this is just with people in general  not only women    this is one thing i m terrible at  i know that when people start to become comfortable around each other  sometimes they ll jokingly give each other shit poke fun at them   i noticed this gaming with some coworkers the other night  they ll always be this back and forth banter between them  sometimes they ll pull me into it and i ll just say something like  haha wowww   but can t really play a long very well    it s like it completely goes over my head and i don t know how to react  not necessarily because i m offended    but literally because sometimes i don t know how to respond  or i m afraid of saying the wrong thing  i feel as though this makes me look boring and too uptight at times  which i am trying to avoid completely    tl dr  sometimes lock up freeze up when people joke around with or jokingly tease me  want to be more playful without over doing it  need tips please  thank you   ,0
regarding social anxiety  does anyone else feel like you make huge progress and soon afterwards much of it fades away again  its so frustrating  i just cant seem to hold onto my achievements  last week i was so happy  confident and content with myself    it was really magical and i was pretty much euphoric every day i woke up in bed  i felt that i finally realized that im a cool guy and that im worthy of being accepted and loved  now since yesterday  my thinking is very negative again  that deep connections with the people around me i felt just days ago feel fake  i dont like who i am  ect   im just sick of it    why cant i really interalize the stuff regarding confidence and self love  im struggling with it for so long now and i want to break free of these chains i put myself into  ,0
women are possibly getting intimidated by my excess of eye contact while speaking i used to avoid eye contact a lot  specially with women  then with practice  i forced myself to get used to eye contact  now what happens is that  i continue to stare people in the eye while they are speaking  even when its uncomfortable for me and also for them  at times while doing this  my eyes become big because im trying to force myself to keep the eye contact   moreover  i want to ask  is it possible for someone to hold eye contact when they are speaking with women for the whole time  i dont think most people do that   it is important to mention that im from india  to give this question a proper context  ,0

how to express yourself more fully and stop being trapped in your head     simple thing  what happens is that we try to think our way out of being too neurotic or always up in our heads  we read these posts  try to memorize them and apply them into our life  how  by thinking  youre wayy up in your head  and youre trying to break out of it by thinking even more  new techniques  ideas and inspiring stories  sure  they are helpful  but its just more filler to your overcrowded mind     nbsp   you cant stop overthinking by diverting your attention to the thing that is causing the problem in the first place  and that is your head  i hope you can see whats the problem here  so  how can you fix this situation  its very simple  but sounds a bit silly    nbsp   put on your favorite music  that gets you super pumped up or excited  make a       minute playlist that has really angry music  sad music  happy music  music that brings out all the different emotions inside you  whatever that just gets you fucking excited when you hear that song    and then  just start dancing and moving to the music like a madman  jump up and down  swing your hands  bang your head with the music  scream the lyrics  shake like a crazy person  do anything that you feel like doing  im saying give all your energy into this       minute window  dont think  just move     nbsp   now youre probably thinking  is op high or some shit  im trying to get rid of my social anxiety and instead this guy gives me the instructions to being a madman   stop thinking  just try it out for a few days and see what happens  if youve never done this  and this happened to me on the first times also  is that your ego gets in the way   oh this is kinda weird  what if someone sees this  this is ridiculous  this is stupid   even when youre behind closed doors and alone  the more you do it  the easier it is to just let go and express yourself the way you want to     nbsp   ive done this only for about a week and i already feel more comfortable in my own skin  i can move more freely and less oppressive thoughts come up  ive even taken interest in learning how to actually dance properly  before i had zero interest in  dancing   its just so damn awesome to move  so just try it out with an open mind   ps  try to couple this with sitting meditation for maximum results     ,0
started off my day today by asking out my crush   the repercussions were beautiful im a senior in high school and i told her i thought she was pretty and that i was wondering if she wanted to go out sometime  we arent super close right now  so she was a bit on edge  but said shed be in touch   that was nice and all  but what happened next never crossed my mind as possible  i was the most social person ive ever been in my life  i talked to more girls in one day than i had for the entire previous month  i was loose  carefree  and feeling very talkative  i literally made friends with a freshman who i had never even seen before while walking to my first class  it was all so awesome   as for the crush  itd be cool to hear from her  but i can truthfully say i am outcome independent right now  i saw her with a big wide grin after i left and even    minutes later as the bell rang    so if youre on edge  just do it  i would do it      times if i could  you will never regret it  good luck everyone   ,0
i think i just figured out why i and maybe some of you cant make friends  i noticed this recently when i was hanging out with a friend  i know alot about her but she doesnt know alot about me  so im kind of a nerd  i like anime manga and i play games alot  but thats not the whole me  i like working out  trying new things  i love sports  and outdoor activities etc  so alot of  if not most  people dont even know about my nerdy side    i was asking a friend if she had played fortnite and she said no  i told her she should try it out and she literally said   why  you dont even like video games  weve been friends for over a year      it also doesnt help that when people first meet me they usually tell me alot about themselves and i just listen    i rarely go on and on about what i like  so its one sided  i know alot about them but not vice versa   thats when it hit me that most of my friends dont know my completely  only about       and i get that we dont fully know anybody  but as far as interests and activities i feel like you should know most of what they like  that way you can have a better friendship with them    do you guys agree   ,0

the difference between introversion and being shy and or socially anxious  edit   wow   i really had no idea how popular this post would be as i kind of did it off the cuff during a lunch break   thanks to everyone who commented and contributed   i hope it was helpful               while i know that many of you are well aware of what introversion is and understand that it is not synonymous with being socially anxious or shy  i see the term misused often on this sub and similar subs   i wanted to take the time to explain the differences      extroversion and introversion are personality traits   nobody is a pure extrovert or a pure introvert   everyone falls somewhere along the spectrum   despite this  we still label ourselves and others as either extroverts or introverts depending on which half of the spectrum they fall  and for the sake of convenience ill use the terms here as well   while im oversimplifying for the sake of brevity these are the core differences    humans need rest and sleep in order to re charge our batteries so to speak   everyone needs to sleep   depending on our personalities we also have other needs    extroverts feel the need to be around others and spend time socializing   generally the more people the better   the more extroverted someone is  the more they need this   when socializing  extroverts prefer large groups to smaller groups   they generally prefer more surface level conversations with many people   often  its been said that extroverts have no inner world as they will often say whats on their mind quickly without taking very much time to consider their words   extroverts often feel frustrated and drained from too much time spent alone and need to connect with others to recharge      introverts need more alone time to recharge their batteries   they generally have the same social skills as extroverts and feel comfortable in social situations  though they prefer   on   conversations or spending time with smaller groups  discussing deeper material   introverts however tend to feel more drained from too many social interactions and will need and crave some alone time to get them ready for their next social interactions     social anxiety is essentially feeling a sense of fear or terror that comes from social interactions with others   this may be due to fear of judgement or rejection   this often leads to avoidance of social situations which in turn makes social anxiety worse and if done over too long of a time  may damage the persons social skills of understanding how to appropriately socialize with others    social anxiety impacts extroverts and introverts equally   there are plenty of extroverts who need to be around people to recharge but experience intense fear that leads them not to get the social interaction they need   their are plenty of introverts who experience social anxiety and find it very hard to socialize with individuals in order to grow closer relationships to get to the point where they can have the deeper connection      there are also plenty of introverts and extroverts who do not experience social anxiety and therefore have incredible social skills      this information may have been extremely basic for some  but i hope it was informative to others      if youd like to learn more about what being an introvert actually means  check out the book quiet by susan cain  ,0

if youre wondering why you have no luck with girls  ask yourself this  what makes you interesting    a friend of mine asked me this question last week  it had never really occurred to me before  my friend does paid graphic design  is really into literature  theatre  movies  various tv dramas  and politics and current affairs  he does public speaking and debating and hes insanely intelligent  hes an interesting person  theres lots he can say about himself   if youre the kind of person who sits around masturbating  playing video games and browsing reddit all day  reading articles about social skills isnt going to help you very much  you need to do something that separates yourself from the endless crowd of boring average joes and makes girls  at least the kind of girls worth dating  think wow  thats interesting  ,0
social anxiety around straight guys  i don t know if i m the only gay man who deals with this  but it seems like every time i m in a predominantly masculine  straight male environment  my anxiety levels go through the roof  it s like i think that they re gonna judge me for not being masculine enough or automatically assume i m gay based on my voice  mannerisms  interests  etc  of course  i m not trying to generalize all straight guys  i think the reason why i think like this is because of trauma  in high school  i dealt with a lot of homophobic bullying back then to the point where it made it harder for me to trust a lot of straight guys in my area  like i said  i m not trying to generalize all straight guys  i obviously know that not all straight guys are homophobic  i just don t understand why i get a borderline anxiety attack when i m in a predominately straight male environment  ,0
how can i work towards relationships that are close where i and the other person are comfortable being vulnerable to each other  with social anxiety  i overthink every part of my social life every single day  i always worry about not being close to x  y and z  i always worry about my conversations being too platonic surface level  i  do  have friends that are close to me  but i still struggle in being vulnerable to them and other people who i want to be close with  i sometimes break down or just get depressed and i refuse to reach out to anyone  even though there are many people that could help  i just    don t know what to do  or how to do it  if there is even a small chance i would be a burden to that person in any way i don t reach out  and because of that i never do  i know it all stems from my lack of self confidence  which i am working on  but i just want to know the proper way to connect with people in a better way than i already do ,0
i did it  i finally did it  i asked a girl out on a date  such a small thing  but its a huge accomplishment for me  i made the phone call  and she said yes  i didnt even stumble or stutter  ive been holding off this whole time for fear of mincing my words and embarrassing myself  but this time i did it right  i might have been shaking through the whole call  but hey  that can only get better with time  right     ,0
sometimes i wish i could just watch how a very social person goes throughout their entire day and take notes on how they do everything    i used to be very obnoxious  but ever since i have made myself a tolerable person to be around  i lack any conversational skills  i just wish i could understand how the structure of a conversation works  and being able to see how another person does it would really help  ,0
failure for many but a success for me so i was on my way from the gym and saw one of my very old friends  shes is pretty older than me and i had no feelings for her but we were good friends when i was a kid   usually i would just ignore and get on with my life  but this time i remembered that i have been thinking about improving my social skills  so i went up to her and said a bold hi and she recognised me and we chatted for a couple of minutes  it was going smooth  but then i panicked when i was saying goodbye and i said the most rushed and awkward goodbye ever  and the girl she was talking to  laughed behind my back  but thats okay i conquered my fear of talking to people and i am grateful that it want my crush and i learned from my mistakes  i hope this will be a good starting point in improving my social skills  and just wanted to tell everyone that its gonna be hard in the beginning but im sure its gonna improve from here on  ,0
advice that helped me realize its okay for people to not like me im a twenty year old female in college  i often struggle with trying to please everyone i meet  and i hate it when people dont like me  i often find myself compromising who i am in order to please those around me  a couple months ago  i was having a conversation with a friend about how i felt like someone i had recently didnt like me  i didnt know why this person felt this way and it was really upsetting me  my friend asked me if i like everyone i meet  i said no  my friend then said  if you dont like everyone you meet  why do you expect everyone who meets you to like you   this made me realize that it is okay for people not to like me  i realized that i cannot always make people happy  and that it is perfectly okay  it has also made me quit trying to please every single person i meet  if they dont like you  then move on and find someone who does like you   ,0

i always feel emotionally drained by my friend who is negative and talks bad about all her other friends  what do i say to her  my roommate  let s say v  talks bad about everyone and she is so negative that it s draining to hold a conversation with her  she thinks the whole world is conspired against her  every conversation is always about her and i don t really feel like she cares about what s going on in my life  i avoid talking to her as much as possible because she will be very repetitive of her problems    recently she s been talking bad about  let s call her a  i knew a in high school but i am not close to her at all  i actually wasn t too fond of her  v recently got close to her and she has been saying how bitchy a is  and that she never does anything for her  i told her  well if a is such a bad friend  then stop being friends with her    and she said  well no  because then i won t have any  friends at all   but i was just tired of v talking bad about her constantly it was getting annoying    the other day i ran into a at the bar  mind you  i was drunk so i actually ended up telling a everything accidentally  she was so mad and ended up giving v the cold shoulder     v is now confronting me and asking me what i told her  v is going to be so mad but to be fair she s talked bad about me  i don t know how to approach the situation  because v loves to dramatize things and i am not ready for that  ,0

dont be friends with someone just because he she wants to be your friend  let me explain   i always had a hard time maintaining friendships  once i moved away or went someplace else  id lose contact  i was always surprised when someone wanted to be my friend  since i usually just sit on the sidelines and watch   this tendency has led to me making friends whom i dont really like   ive had friends where i would look at them and think  i really dont like you  i disliked so many things about them  their morality  the way they would treat others  and their worldviews  so i stopped being friends with them  since i hung out with them so much  i missed out on opportunities to befriend people i actually enjoyed talking to   i used to be passive when it came to friendships  i learned how to be more active  i try to start more conversations  send presents  and just be a better friend in general  and from now on ill be discerning about the people that im friends with  as you get older  its harder and harder to find that good friend who truly understands you  dont waste your time with people who you secretly think   i really dislike this person    i pick my friends very wisely  i no longer befriend people just because they want to be my friend  i used to be desperate just to be friends with anyone  i would get happy just because someone showed an interest in being my friend  now i have to get to know someone a bit first and analyze their character before i decide to develop a friendship with them    just some advice  i hope it helps  ,0
step   to eliminate social anxiety  interacting with women   social groups  let me ask you a question   when you re at work and the boss assigns you and some other people to a specific task  can you interact with those people easily about the specific task  however  if you see the   same people   at lunch or at some work function  do you feel nervous and completely uncertain how to interact   what about in school  if the teacher assigns you to a group for a specific project  can you interact with the people in the group about that specific project  but again  if you see those   same people   at a party or wandering around campus  do you feel completely awkward and lost for something to say   how about a sports team or any kind of group that you re in  you know that    minute period after everyone has arrived  but before practice  or whatever the group s purpose is  actually begins   that    minutes where people are  socializing     how do you feel then  awkward  nervous and uncomfortable   however once practice begins  or the group s actual function begins  then the nervousness goes away  and you can interact about the group s purpose relatively freely   right     structured vs  unstructured social environments  what is the similarity between the examples above   it s that you are     perfectly capable of interacting with people and     perfectly capable of speaking and having a conversation  in a structured social environment   this is when the  purpose of the interaction is clear  and the  topic of discussion  is well defined   basically  when you  know what you re supposed to be talking about   talking and interacting is relatively easy   when you go into a store  for example  and you need to discuss something specific  about a product you re buying  with someone who works there  do you struggle then   no   because what you re  talking about  is clearly defined   however if you went into  the same store  and saw  the same person  and tried to talk to them with no clearly defined topic  like   hey  what s going on   then you would feel nervous and be lost for what to say   the point here is that your social anxiety is not  being afraid of people    and it s not  an inability to talk    the problem is  you don t know how to interact when the  topic of discussion  isn t clearly defined   this happens in an unstructured social environment  where  socializing  is the purpose   and  socializing  isn t clearly defined  which makes it really hard  since it s not clear what you re supposed to be talking about   that s when you  go blank    get nervous   and  don t know what to say   this is when you start worrying about what  other people think      what other people think  there s a great quote from winston churchill which goes something like this      when you re     you worry about what other people think      when you re     you stop worrying about what other people think      when you re     you realize that they were never thinking anything about you in the first place   try this thought exercise   assume you have a nice car  you re out in town and some walks by and randomly says  hey man  i love your car  what kind of    and then he starts asking you questions about your car   what would you do   would you think something like   this is a stupid topic of discussion  i can t believe this idiot is wasting my time bringing up this topic    no  the answer is no   you would just start interacting with him about the car  and it would be a perfectly comfortable interaction because the topic of discussion is clearly defined  the other guy defined it for you   well  that is exactly the same in reverse  when you start talking  about anything  people just start interacting with you  they do not start wondering things like   is this topic good enough  or  interesting enough  or  i can t believe this person is wasting my time with this boring topic    you may think that people react that way  because that s how people react online   for example  consider scrolling through youtube videos  when you do that  you are making hundreds of decisions  over and over  about whether  this is interesting  or  that is not interesting   these decisions are based on a thumbnail with a picture and a few words   in real life  people aren t walking around with thumbnails so that you can judge whether or not their topic of discussion is  good or not   people just start talking  and it s human nature to simply start interacting     the world on a pedestal  when it comes to interacting with girls  what is the most common thing you hear guys saying    i don t know what to say    guys say that all the time  and what is the most common reason given for why he doesn t know what to say   it s that he s  putting her on a pedestal   he s considering her to be  above himself  in social status and that s why he never knows what to say   you ve heard me say before that  there is no right topic when talking to a girl  no topic is inherently interesting  it s you that makes it interesting  it s the passion in your voice  it s your enthusiasm and excitement   that s what makes something interesting    well it s no different when considering any social interaction   there is no  right topic   there is only you making something interesting or not   if you re nervous about what other people think  it s because you re putting the world on a pedestal  you are living in a reality where you believe the opinions of others are more important than your own opinion     two things       first     why would you continue believing that  you were put on this earth to live the life that you desire  you don t need other people to approve  you don t need other people to agree   if you don t believe that  go to a grave yard  stand there silently and look around   it s highly likely that many of the people resting in those plots of earth disagreed with each other  perhaps one thought the other was stupid  and vice versa  perhaps one thought the decisions and lifestyle choices of the other was stupid  and vice versa   does any of that matter now   is it worth spending your life  you re relatively short life in the grand scheme of things  worrying about what other people think  those people are all going to be buried in the dirt   and all their thoughts  ideas and opinions are going to vanish  like the smoke from a single match struck in high wind     second     more importantly  take the advice of winston churchill  and realize that  wisdom  isn t knowing something that someone else doesn t know  it s knowing something sooner than someone else   everyone reading this article will eventually realize that other people  aren t thinking anything about you   i guarantee you will realize that someday   if you want to be wise  then make  someday  arrive much sooner  realize it now while you re still young enough to do something with your life   the other day i was at the gym and i saw an  old guy   grey hair   probably    something  walk straight up to a young girl  a    something  and start flirting with her  he had no hesitation  no fear  it was obvious what he was doing   she smiled and giggled and had the  oh jees  an old man is hitting on me  look about her  the old man was unsuccessful at closing the deal  obviously  and she rejected him kindly   but what hit home for me was how fearless he appeared  he must have finally realized that  nobody is thinking anything about you    but like many people  it s possible that his realization came too late in life  when his hair had gone gray  and his dick had gone limp     step   to eliminate social anxiety  there s a billion dollar industry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies out there ready to fill you full of pills that will  cure  your social anxiety   here s my question   how s that working out for you    it s not  the answer is   it s not    because pills don t cure  thought process   they simply mask the problems  they make you numb to your fears instead of tackling your fears head on   if you want to tackle your fears head on and become comfortable with social interaction  and with female interaction   the first step is to simply stop beating yourself up   if the message in this article is resonating with you  then it s highly likely you spend time  beating yourself up   probably not physically  but mentally you do it all the time   you get mad at yourself for being nervous   you get mad at yourself for passing on a social event out of fear   you get mad at yourself for  not being as good as other people    you get mad at yourself for many reasons  over and over   you may get mad at yourself as you lay down to sleep  a whirlwind of emotions and anger and thoughts spiraling through your mind  keeping you agitated and awake   think about how much time you spend beating yourself up   how much wasted time and wasted energy   and what s the point   there s a hole in the ground  in some distant future  it s waiting for you  and you re most likely going to arrive at that hole at the exact same time   whether you spend your whole life worrying  or spend it growing  enjoying  accepting and learning   there is no purpose to life other than the purpose you give it   from now on  when you encounter nervousness related to social interact  stop for a moment  recognize it  smile  accept it  tell yourself that it s ok  that you re not going to beat yourself up   make your life s purpose to simply enjoy  seeing what happens   in social situations  you no longer need to rely on structured social environments  when the  topic of discussion  isnt clearly defined  talk about whatever comes to mind   just say something  anything  youre not carrying a thumbnail for people to judge   if you simply talk  they  will  interact with you   and if they laugh  then they laugh   if they judge  they judge   what s the difference   there are holes in the ground waiting for them too   and as churchill said  the reality is that   none of them are thinking anything about you anyway          btw  if youre feeling this post  make sure to check out my

how to spot toxic friends    they make you the  weird one   i am constantly treated as the  weird kid  and this is due to my former friend talking shit behind my back  the people who care to get to know me to realize im normal  i might be awkward sometimes  but ive learned to not give a shit        they act like they are higher than you  as a short guy  i often end up with friends who use me as a comparison device  wanna impress a girl  just have your     friend hang out with you  i dont realize thats why they hang out with me til much later  but it still happens  usually  these people are overweight  skinny  short or just have body image issues  i once had a toxic friend who lorded the fact that he was     over my      which was stupid and made him look worse by comparison  mostly because hed call me  short  in front of people  that doesnt work when youre the  nd shortest guy in school        they take away any validation from you  ive been on a social skills journey for most of my high school life  ive made great strides fighting social anxiety  timidness  my general lack of social skills  etc  i had one friend who told me multiple times that  a  hes the only reason i have friends  b  i would be nothing without him  and c  he is the only reason i got to where i am today  bullshit  he was a literal obstacle if anything        they put you down  this is usually to make you still stay with them  this makes them feel better about themselves  put downs are to either raise them up or put you down        they insult your masculinity  my last toxic friend did this to me a lot  hed insult how i dressed  how i acted  if i broke any traditional masculine tendencies  usually id fawn over a puppy  baby  or cute thing  maybe id do something  feminine    either way  no reason to insult me  ,0
i high fived a stranger  everybody says that when you start running you kind of join a community and everyone is nice and friendly  etc   however  i am used to run for more than   years now  always alone  so i never got that feeling   besides  if i have trouble talking to other people in normal situations  imagine doing it while running  forget it   but  yesterday  i think i got it   i was running early morning on a new route and found other fellow runners as well  even before i start  a runner said good morning to me  and i answered out loud and in a friendly tone  which is not easy for me     this happened every time i encountered other people running  they would say good morning like we were in the same club  or like they knew me   i think the feeling of everyone suffering through the exercise and see other people doing it to creates that feeling   in the end of my run  i saw again a guy that i had seen earlier  also running  we were both tired and sweating  and when he was coming in my direction  he lifted his hand and i high fived him  while running  without even speaking   that made my day  because a  i connected with other humans and b  i didn t have to do small talk or anything   i ll try to nod or say hi on my next runs and see how that goes now  also  i want to thank everyone in this sub for sharing how difficult is to connect with other people  i feel less weird every time i read your posts    ,0

university day   i talked to someone  i go to the same university as my brother so he drops me off and picks me up and walks me to my classes and makes sure im in the right one  hes great   but today he had his class on the other side of the campus so he couldnt take me to my class  he explained to me where my class was and i didnt catch exactly where it was but i didnt want him to be late so i went anyway  after a few minutes of walking  i felt kind of lost so i decided to ask someone where exactly my class was  and there was only one group of boys and girls there who were chatting  probably seniors   i stood around them for a few minutes before asking for directions and they were so so extremely sweet and i felt so good afterward  i know this seems silly but it honestly made my day  ,0
if you are willing to look at another person s behavior toward you as a reflection of the state of their relationship with themselves rather than a statement about your value as a person  then you will  over a period of time cease to react at all   ,0

is it normal to want to  dip out  of  life  for a little bit and work on yourself  i m    and i live in a small town  mostly bars  churches and schools here  i am tired of the norm and lately have really been wanting to make some positive life changes  it started when i got let go from a job that at first seemed perfect  i knew i wouldn t be happy and i ended up with an opportunity even better  i know it all happened for a reason  now i m finding myself wanting to be alone and just work on    me   i haven t drank since monday night and the past two weeks i ve been making it a point to be outside most of the time  nature makes me feel good and takes my mind off of any anxieties i m having  i even made it to the library to pick up a few books  i haven t read a book in     months  i haven t read an entire book for years  i also went to church last night  i feel like most of my life i ve been so focused on others perception of me and how i fit in the community  but that doesn t bring happiness  what i m attempting to do with my life now  is seeming to do just that  is this a normal thing to go through  to just want to hide out and work on me  some would call it depression but i feel that self love is a necessity and i don t think it s something i possess  actually  i know it isn t   ,0

i m very boring so i ve come to the conclusion that i m a very boring person  i ve always been a very shy and quite person for the most part but not because i m necessarily introverted and dislike talking to people  i m just not very good at it  i enjoy social settings and want to be a part of them but never know how to act when i m in them  and i m not really self conscious in any way other than the fact that i know i am pretty socially awkward in almost all situations  or atleast that s the way i feel    the reason that hate this so much is because i feel like nobody really likes me that much and i don t have real great connection with anyone  i have friends and i don t think people really hate me because i always try to be extremely nice to people but i don t think anyone would choose to be around me because i know i m just a dull person to talk to  even with my closest friends who i ve known for my entire life  i find that i can be extremely boring  if i m in a group with people i m great friends with it s not a big problem but as much as hate to say it when i get one on one even with somebody who i would consider one of my best friends it can become awkward to some degree and i can have some trouble holding a conversation  i don t know how to make any kind of small talk past  hi i m so and so    where are you from   and maybe  oh you take said class  so do i  when meeting someone new  and nothing ever really builds off of those phenomenal conversation starters  because of things like this i can t seem to make any kind of relationship with people unless it s through someone i already know  i can go on and explain the millions of problems i have on a daily basis but this would turn into a fucking novel so i m not gonna do that  so basically anybody have similar problems advice to help with a socially awkward person  ,0
the problem might be    your voice  as someone with a naturally quiet  meek voice  it took me years to realize this  i was even told multiple times in high school that i mumbled a lot  i kinda laughed it off at the time  through out my   s  friends and colleagues would often ask me to repeat myself  i didnt think anything of it  i also started realizing that when i told a story  it never got the reaction i expected  my friends could tell similar stories and somehow always get the laugh or the great reaction  i was often cut off mid sentence  god forbid there was a group of people talking  because i could never say more than five words before someone started talking over me  i couldnt keep a girlfriend for longer than a few weeks   yeah  it sucked  i was determined to figure out my problem   i learned about everything  and i became very well rounded and a good conversationalist who could talk about most major topics  but i still couldnt make people laugh or keep people engaged for long     heres what changed my life     i started recording myself talking about random stuff  i recorded video and audio of myself telling stories  i compared my tapes with recordings of engaging people on youtube  it became clear how boring my voice and mannerisms and nonverbal skills were  my voice was slightly more engaging than eeyores  i wasnt totally monotone  but i was close  i didnt move my mouth much  i didnt even speak up  i didnt add inflection or energy  my words were fine  by my voice was boring   and video recording myself showed me how little i moved  if i was a silent film  no one would watch me  i realized how important movement is  move your face  move your mouth  move your hands  not a lot  but move sometimes  people just like movement  its more engaging   i started experimenting with adding energy to my voice  i emphasized certain words  i increased my volume overall  i learned to stretch my mouth jaw muscles in the morning so they were more relaxed  saying  how now brown cow  in an exaggerated way is a well known one   i recorded different versions of myself telling the same story  it felt weird to add so much enthusiasm and inflections at first  but when i watched video  it was amazing how engaging and interesting i came across  i started doing it in real life   it was amazing how instantly more engaging i became  people always say its not what you say  but how you say it    and i finally realized the power of that advice   if you do nothing else   make sure your voice and your nonverbal skills are on point  trust me     x   b   edit  everyones asking who i personally like to study   i love aziz ansari  if you break down what he says  a lot of times its not even that interesting or funny  but it doesnt matter  i could watch him for hours because of how dynamic his nonverbal skills are  the way he talks and moves is interesting all on its own    edit    a lot people asking for more resources   ive been working on a new site  here  https   www socialupgrader com    i hope you get something out of it  ,0
do you struggle when talking to strangers  try your hand at these social challenges if you struggle with starting conversations it typically stems from several main issues   one of the most common reasons why you feel scared to go talk to strangers is that you dont know what to say   it happens to everyone no matter how good they are eventually everyone will be stuck in a situation where theyre unsure of what to say    in reality youre perfectly capable of carrying on conversations just fine with people like family and close friends but just struggle with new people   your conversation skills are already there but you end up judging yourself too much and turn the filter on too hard   learning to talk to strangers is an individual skill set that many people are unfamiliar with     if youre perfectly okay with finding things to talk the next major issue is feeling like youre bothering the other person   the fundamental key that ties being social altogether is rewiring your mental beliefs and creating a positive frame that helps you rather than hinders you   feeling like youre bothering someone is actually a good thing because it means you have a level of awareness and that you give a shit about the other persons experience   often times you feel this way because you see it as you have to impress the other person by finding something valuable to say otherwise theyll disapprove of you    pick a day and really go out and watch other people as they walk down the street   most people look angry  neutral  sad and usually rarely happy   the reality is everyone is tired and overworked and just drudging through their routine on autopilot    you have to have the frame that everyone is your friend and its selfish for you not to say something to them because you would be holding back your awesomeness from them  everyone is running around in their boring day and just hoping for something exciting to happen to them   you have to see it as ripping people out of their boring monotonous routine and trying to spread some light on them  everyone is already on your side   theyre rooting for you to be the normal human being you already are   if someone responds negatively that is more of a reflection of the relationship with themselves than a reaction to you   success is focusing on the lessons of negative social interactions while downplaying any backlash as a personal attack and focusing in super hard on any little victory     head out for a walk and just say hi to five people as you pass them   dont try to stop them and keep walking   just drop hi bombs as youre passing random people   the amazing thing that youll find is most people dont even care   most people will just keep on walking like nothing happened   another reaction will be a faint hi back but nothing serious   rarely will people actually engage you because youre going to keep on walking   much like playing an rpg video game  you rarely acknowledge the plethora of random characters in the world that arent part of the story   embrace your anonymity and love every second that its no big deal    if the thought of saying hi to random strangers causes anxiety its typically due to the perceived thought of social backlash   having this anxiety when talking to strangers is nothing to be ashamed of   the truth is that its actually a good thing and theres nothing wrong with you   evolutionary this anxiety is actually just impulse control thats gotten out of hand   be thankful for it because if you didnt have impulse control youd go around stealing from shops landing yourself in jail   think about all the times you wanted to call your boss a sockcucker right to his face but you stopped yourself   thats your natural impulse control kicking in so you dont get fired or punched in the babymaker        easy mode challenge    say hi to five old ladies as you pass them   nobody is less threatening than a sweet grandma    you may find that the old ladies are actually receptive or that theyre cold and bitter   regardless of their reactions  you succeed this challenge just by getting out there and doing it       easy mode challenge v     say hi to five people who are not old ladies   the purpose of this challenge is to start expanding your group from safe targets   you dont have to approach models  just anyone who is not a sweet grandma   same success standards apply from the last challenge       return of the grandmas     stop   old ladies and ask them for the time   simply say  excuse me  do you have the time please    smile and be as genuine as you can   you succeed just by asking but bonus points if they actually stop and tell the time   thank them graciously and be on your way     the key of the challenge is to still have a safe target but gently pushing the comfort zone   now instead of just dropping hi bombs and bailing youre actually going to have to stop someone and ask them something   asking for the time is great because it implies to the other person that once you get the time youll be off quickly   plus this is a very tame and  innocent question   most people will gladly give you the time because of our inclination to do cheap favours for other people       the tap    time to throw something more nerve wracking into the mix   your mission is to tap one person on the shoulder and say hi   approach from the side and not directly behind them   if you feel uncomfortable or they seem weirded out just apologize and say that you thought they were a friend of yours   wish them a good one and be off promptly    rarely will someone actually be upset with this if youre genuine   if they are they are probably just dealing with a stomach ache from last nights all you can quaff oyster special      the key here is that youre able to recognize or not if you made them feel uncomfortable and acknowledged it   youll find that when someone else makes you feel uncomfortable its only made worse when its plainfully obvious that they have no idea how uncomfortable you are   funnily enough if they acknowledge it and apologize it can flip like a switch from being uncomfortable to a more relaxed feeling   this can be the key difference from someone whos got their shit together who feels good to talk to and someone whos sitting in the corner of the gym muttering to you about how peanut butter was on sale       compliment bombs     a value giving challenge where you have to give    compliments to strangers   classic and boring but this is a fantastic challenge that shows how little people will actually respond   youll likely get a mix of people who dont even acknowledge you  who barely acknowledge you and people who are truly thrilled with it   youll want to make the compliment as genuine as possible but i personally recommend sticking to clothing items   pass by and dont stop and just make quick  i like your shoes  sir  or  nice shirt my friend    the best way to do this is to get into momentum and pick a busy street and just march forward   your goal should be to tackle the  volume of this challenge in one session and as quickly as possible   this challenge will teach you the power of flow and to show you the range of how people can respond       cashier catastrophe    next challenge is a relatively safe one but continues to push the comfort zone   your goal is to ask    cashiers how their day is going   the challenge is safe because these people are working and youre asking an innocent question   similar to the compliment challenge  many people will have no idea how to respond because so few people actually ask them how theyre doing   some people will not respond positively and others may give you a weird look   the people who are worth it in life and not just this challenge are the ones who you end up brightening their day and actually engage you back   this challenge should be something you internalize into your regular routine   people spend far too much time trying to win over others whom they dont have any natural chemistry with  chuck those people to the curb and find those who can meet your enthusiasm     top of the class    wanted to try ballroom

  ways to boost your confidence and fix your self esteem     stop comparing yourself to others  whether in looks  confidence  wealth or intelligence   this is not easy  but i find the best way to stop this is to take a minute and realize     your awesome traits that make you unique     that all that you can be is the best you  take mindset that  out of   billion people on this planet many have been in similar or even the exact situation you are now and have come out successful  happy individuals  the sooner you stop comparing the sooner you can start working on the best you        level of being attracts level of life   this means if you think and act as if you have a low self esteem  are unattractive or boring peolple will treat in that manner  you cant expect people to treat you better then you treat yourself  if you find yourself boring and dull then make yourself interesting to yourself  so many people say they are boring and who would want to hang out with them  make yourself not boring  find an activity hobby that you love to do or would love to try out and do it  if your upset that no one invited you out  go invite someone out  people will notice your behavior and act accordingly  if you always have acted in a certain manner for the past while dont expect people to  act out  and try to change it  to cite the above example if you are known to stay home and binge watch on the weekends dont expect people to send you an invite when they go out  i hear people say   he she is so cool  they know how to do x y and z   you can become an interesting  awesome person  dont let the past drag you down  close your eyes for a minute and imagine that the past was gone  and nothing could stop you what would you set out to learn and accomplish  what would you pursue       this is the most important  you have to rewrite how you think about yourself  the biggest struggle that gets in the way is you  for years you have drilled into your mind that you have low self esteem or can never be financially successful  never get that hot date  he she is out of my league    never make friends  are boring  this takes time and is more effective when you have a friend  coach or parent affirming these statements  i used to tell people to ask themselves why is that true   times until i found that maxwell maltz breaks it down more effectively in his book psycho  cybernetics  it comes down to asking yourself   questions      why do you believe that  what proof do you have      can it be you were mistaken or are basing this on a single or even just a few past experiences      do you past the same harsh judgment on other people in a similar situation or do you empathize with them instead      if this feeling is not true why act like is if there is no good reason to believe it   im looking to interview a few people that want to build up and boost their confidence and charisma  if your available for a    minute interview over the next week or so  please pm me or leave a yes  in the comments   in exchange i am happy to offer you a free  no   pitch   private call with me to learn how to boost your self image  confidence and charisma   thanks  ,0
watch for these   big ways people try to manipulate you in social situations  heres how to defend yourself and become immune  no one likes to be manipulated  but it s really a part of life  we are all selling and convincing others about our ideas and ourselves every day  where manipulation goes wrong  in my opinion  is when it is used with  evil intent   so  if we can learn about the most common manipulation tactics  we can become immune to them   once we go through these  you ll see them everywhere  commercials  politicians  even pushy friends  some people are naturals  others have studied the craft  either way  it should be your choice on how to react      tactic     reciprocating    we subconsciously feel pressured to repay those who have done something for us  have you ever gotten a gift for christmas without having anything to give back  awkward  right  sales people will do this by offering free trials  or giving away samples  tricky friends will buy you a beer before asking for cash  keep your eyes out  and remember  you can say politely say no     tactic     commitment and consistency    this is an absolute favorite in sales  getting people to say yes to small stuff before asking for big stuff makes it more likely to get another yes  or  if someone asks how you re doing  and you say great  they might ask if you re great enough to give  em a ride somewhere  tough to back out  again  it s fine to say no  take pauses in between the questions people ask you to make sure you aren t feeling pressured     tactic     social proof    humans are pack animals  and this tactic can be really  really powerful  we tend to follow the leader and the crowd  but it goes deeper than that  the more people we see doing something  the more we believe it s the right thing to do  it s why laugh tracks make you think those terrible jokes might actually be funny  or why bartenders fill their tip jars with money before the shift  don t be a follower  be a leader   here are some epic stories of leadership  https   conquer today improve leadership skills  utm medium social utm source reddit utm campaign leadership lessons utm content manipulation utm term social skills  that can give you some step by step instructions to grow  this whenever you see  the pack  moving in a certain direction  make sure it s something that you know is the right thing to do     tactic     likability    probably the most innocent but powerful of these tactics  we simply trust people we like  people who look good  compliment you  stay positive  keep in contact with you  or are similar people to us are all likable  likable people are awesome  and fun to be around  but keep the request seperate from the requestor  just be wary that  even if they don t know it  they might be steering you down the wrong path     tactic     authority    we ve all seen how badly it can go when we listen to the wrong authority figures  combined with social proof  leaders can create irreparable damage  it s really heartbreaking  authority figures will turn their opinions into statements of fact  they will say these things forcefully  and with great passion  ask yourself if this person is really an expert in what they re talking about  remember  authority figures are just people like you and i  to combat authority  you can use this  semi goofy but effective  power up  exercise  https   conquer today power exercise improve confidence  utm medium social utm source reddit utm campaign power up utm content manipulation utm term social skills  before stressful situations and keep a cool head     tactic     scarcity    humans are more likely to avoid pain than to seek pleasure  basically  the thought of losing something motivates us more than the thought of gaining something with similar value  this is why  limited time offers  and  only a few products left  work so well  we don t want to miss out  you need to realize that you are never getting a  deal       off something means you still spend     of your money on something you might not have bought to if there wasn t a deal  you can battle scarcity by being proactive  and understanding what you really want in life ahead of time  then  when opportunities come along  you can jump on the right ones and ignore the wrong ones    let me know if youve seen some of these tactics lately  and if anything above is going to help you next time    if you feel a bit enlightened with this stuff  you may have heard of the book    laws of power  i read it  and it always gave me such a sick feeling to my stomach  i  revised those laws here  https   conquer today    laws of power revised people arent evil egomaniacs  utm medium social utm source reddit utm campaign    laws of power utm content manipulation utm term social skills  to fit a bit more with my values and character  how to still become a powerful influential person without compromising your true self    have the freedom and the power to live on your own terms  since we all still have to play the game of life  you can use these tactics on your own for good or evil  i know you ll make the right choice      ,0
how to talk to funny people  alright i didn t know how to title this  i don t know if anyone else has had trouble with this kind of stuff but i feel like i ve always found it difficult to talk to people that crack jokes all the time  people who s main method of connecting with others is through bantering or building off each other s jokes   this has been impacting my social life a lot  because there are some types of people and situations i just can t adapt to well  and there are a lot of people like this   the problem is i m not quick or witty enough to think of creative and clever things to reply with  i usually just resort to laughing  because at least that could be interpreted positively by them  but they probably think of me as boring as a result  although  i ve also had situations where people seem to think something is wrong if i only respond with laughter  like i am taking offense with what they re saying or something   and to be honest  a lot of the time i don t really want to joke around like that  it s a lot of effort and sometimes i can t really see the purpose of it  i do enjoy listening to other people cracking jokes between each other though  i guess i just don t like participating in it because it s mentally taxing   i don t know how to deal with this issue  i can t just become wittier  i ve kind of tried over the past few years    you might suggest just not talking to people like that  but i can t do that     some of these people are family  colleagues etc    i really need advice on what to do about this because it s gotten to a point now where whenever i m in these situations i freeze up and feel super embarrassed for saying something i know is stupid in response  because i couldn t think of something good quickly enough  i can t deal with this anymore  i cringe so much at myself for saying some things    my default way of understanding is to take the literal interpretation  that is the easiest and quickest thing i can work with  but of course  the kinds of jokes i m referring to aren t supposed to be interpreted literally  and i understand the underlying meanings of said jokes  i just don t know how to think of a response beyond that quickly enough  and it gives people the impression that i misunderstood them  but i didn t  i just didn t know what to say    and it really sucks because i enjoy being around these kinds of people  and i really admire their wit  but i just can t be like that   if anyone can help me out i d be super grateful  thanks   edit  wow i didn t expect this many replies  thank you so much to everyone who took the time to comment  i really appreciate it  a lot of points have been brought up that i never would have considered myself  i will think about them more  ,0

i randomly asked a girl out on the street she said no but it actually felt really good when the fear went away  i just thought to my self if i didnt ask i would never know the result  my chance would be at zero  if i do ask i might still fail but there is also a chance she say yes  plus complementing a girl might make her day so i went for it  my fear went away after i asked her  i got a no but it honestly wasnt that big of a deal  i took a chance so i wont fall asleep thinking about what could of happened if i didnt ask her  i guess that saying is true  fear is temporary but regret lost forever  i did learn cutting straight to the point might be awkward to most people  she actually got really embarrassed and didnt know how to respond    edited    i am really glad i posted this i didnt know its such an bad thing to be straight forward and politely when asking girls out on the street  i am not being sarcastic i really didnt know its ptsd for most girls  its pretty cool to see perspective coming from the female viewing point  i might not agree with all of them and you might not agree with mine and thats completely fine  thats the way it should be  i just wanted to share my experience overcoming my fear of social interactions  i know it has been pointed out by many in this thread its not the best start but it is mine and i have to start some where  have a nice day everyone  ,0

the next time you feel awkward and uncomfortable        remember that you feel uncomfortable because you are out of your  comfort  zone   and if you want to improve you life over what you already have  thats where youve got to be   so mentally give yourself a high five and walk away with smile on your face for surviving it and being brave enough to push yourself  ,0
anyone else finding it difficult to maintain a balance between  not forcing it  with conversation and not being boring  so i feel like a lot of advice i read is to not force conversation and for it to come naturally  however  i find that if i relax too much and just sit there with someone  it feels boring and there are awkward silences   i tend to find myself scanning my brain for conversation topics until i finally think of something that i force myself to say  it s incredibly draining but if i try it the other way around just nothing happens   anyone have a similar experience  any advice for finding that balance would be appreciated  ,0
